without the minister for veterans and people my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns he be halfway up everest with group of soldier raise fund for armed force charity and raise the profile of veteran and be sure that the whole house wish he well most of we also think rather he than this government have confirm the big increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war which will boost national security and make defence the engine for growth in every part of the united kingdom for too long small business have feel leave out of defence but no more we be set new target to ensure that small firm benefit from that increase in defence spending we be set up new support centre to guide small business on access to defence and for the first time we be make british base business priority for british taxpayer defence investment too wish the veterans minister the good of luck as he climb everest and be sure we all agree rather he than we in today world warfare be change dramatically drone cost can destroy tank worth million but the innovation cycle for those drone be rapid they be design to become obsolete within month we need dynamic sme sector to produce those drone but defence sme be struggle to get the finance they need with lack of long term contract and lack of guarantee multilateral defence bank could help to ensure that those firm get the finance they need will the secretary of state please set out the discussion he be have to help to found that multilateral defence bank my hon friend be quite right about the fact that capability be now change in week not month or even year he be also right about finance that be why go to the london stock exchange last week and close the market think it be the first time defence secretary have ever do that want to signal that this government want new partnership with not just industry and innovator but investor and that mean change the way in which defence do its work have meet outstanding uk sme such as supacat and many other which contribute to the sovereign industrial base that our security depend on however under the last government the percentage of ministry of defence direct expenditure go to sme fall from to will my right hon friend confirm when this government expect to surpass that record and therefore back the innovation we need to equip our force and support our ally

the sector the issue that they raise with be echo during my visit last week to local composite manufacturer pentaxia include access finance to grow and complicated defence procurement process what be the defence secretary do to engage with small and medium sized company to ensure that they can get fair crack at government defence contract my hon friend know well than most the challenge for small firm enter into the supply chain in defence and she do more than most to champion their case we want defence to do business differently and make it easy for small firm and new entrant to start do

create job and employment for local people will the secretary of state therefore outline how the department will ensure that as many sme as possible be aware of government procurement opportunity so that they can deliver job in area such as derby my hon friend make an important point the access of sme to defence be very often through prime and subcontracting rather than directly with the ministry of defence itself it be the certainty of long term relationship and long term contract for the prime that allow they to pass those benefit on to small firm that be why it be significant that when my hon friend join at the derby rolls royce factory when announce the eight year billion unity contract for rolls royce small firm be part of that submarine supply chain do not wish to end the defence

taker and that all we have in exchange be glorify talking shop with not penny of guarantee defence funding the hon gentleman be quite right interruption he be quite right in that during the last defence question time he talk about our not be exclude from the security action for europe defence fund that would include eu state would have think that he would welcome this afternoon agreement

hon friend the minister while he be on everest in say that he would welcome meeting with my hon friend and will ensure that it take place take it that the meeting will not be on everest the secretary of state know as well as do that one of the most distressing experience for our veteran today be the fear of be drag into court in the face of politically motivated prosecution after the clonoe and coagh inquiry which open month ago some action will obviously have to be take to protect they be the mod currently research the legal judicial and legislative requirement that be necessary to protect our veteran from this appalling treatment the right hon gentleman be right we owe the operation banner veteran huge debt of gratitude their professionalism and in many case sacrifice of their life save civilian life and help to bring about the peace that northern ireland now enjoy in respect of clonoe the right hon gentleman know that the mod be seek judicial review of the coroner finding and

while legally abandon our brave veteran and throw they to the wolf hesitate to turn this into party political debate but the right hon gentleman have just do that he must accept that the previous government woeful legacy act do nothing to help veteran it be find unlawful over and over again and any incoming government last summer would have have to deal with that legacy which be what we be do be work with the secretary of state for northern ireland be look to ensure that we minimise the impact of any investigation on this special and unique group of veteran who serve with great distinction in most case to keep the peace secure long term peace and protect civilian labour could have appeal those judgment to the supreme court but choose not to labour mp and peer have already vote for this barmy process in the joint committee on human rights on february labour will now be expect all its mps to vote for it again this autumn give that many of the young soldier who serve on operation banner in northern ireland be recruit from red wall seat from barnsley to blackpool and from bolton to burnley how on earth do this government expect any labour mp to do gerry adams favour at the

unlawful time and again we have to deal with that problem and any government would my concern be for the uk service personnel who serve in northern ireland over period of year who be there to protect

next month will meet ally in preparation for the hague summit in june nato have never be more vital for britain defence and security than in this era of global instability and volatility be therefore alarmed that certain green party politician have suggest that the uk leave nato abandon our commitment to our ally include other european nation and the defence of ukraine and of our share democratic value will the minister reassure this house that this labour government will recommit to work even more closely with our ally for our collective defence and will he confirm that unlike certain other party labour will always put the security of our citizen first let be absolutely clear with the house nato be the cornerstone of our security and this government commitment to the alliance be unshakeable the greens if that be the case would be out of step with the british people who recognise the importance of nato membership we should also be clear that the only person who would benefit from take apart the nato alliance sit in the kremlin president putin that be victory we will not give he the ukrainian military response to putin invasion have be formidable one of the way it have be so impressive be through its innovation in drone technology with ukraine now world leader in strategic and tactical drone do the minister agree that it be important that the uk along with our nato ally continue to invest in the ukrainian military so that it can continue its fight for freedom and so that we can benefit from the advance in technology that the ukrainian military have bring forward absolutely agree the uk be co lead the drone capability coalition with latvia and we be improve and learn from the experience of our friend in ukraine drone technology in ukraine iterate every two to three week so it be absolutely vital not only that we create the environment for new investment in drone technology but that the uk military look at those lesson learn would expect large part of the strategic defence review to be look at the lesson that we can learn from ukraine and apply they to our own military unlike certain other institution nato be an alliance of separate sovereign country thank the minister for his strong support of nato but do he agree that we should follow the example of the frontline nato state like estonia and poland which recognise that the difference between deter hostile russia and actually have to fight war be the difference between spend or of gdp on defence as we do in the and or if god forbid we ever have to engage in open hostility thank the right hon gentleman for that question this government be deliver for defence with increase defence spending by april we will be spend of our gdp on defence which include an extra billion for defence in this financial year that will rise to in the next parliament when economic condition allow what we spend that money on be just as important and that be what the strategic defence review when it be publish will set out at the end of march the us secretary of state tell the foreign ministers of the baltic state that the us want to continue participate in eu defence procurement initiative what have the uk discuss with the eu about any exclusion of us company link to the security and defence pact it be certainly true that right across europe there be european and american firm provide the capability we need to keep our people safe it be right that we continue those discussion with our european friend to look at how uk firm can participate because uk firm be already present around europe provide resource as indeed be our american friend we all need to spend more on defence and we all need to renew our capability we be work together to ensure that we have the framework and structure to enable that renewal of our force to take place armed forces housing what step he be take to improve armed force housing for military family we be deliver for defence by put people at the heart of our defence

physical health what step be the government take to ensure that the child from service family who attend school in north yorkshire live in adequate accommodation agree with my hon friend analysis of the impact of poor housing we have regain control of of the service family accommodation unit in yorkshire and humber previously own by annington after landmark deal early this year as well as save

ministry of defence continue to provide welfare support and legal support to those affect be determined that we will do more operation banner defeat the ira militarily and pave the way for the good friday agreement so why be this labour government now push two tier justice to the obvious detriment of our brave northern ireland veteran and to the advantage of gerry adams and his sinn féin fellow traveller where be the justice in that this government be deal with the woeful shortcoming of the last government northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act as we do so we will give priority to strengthen the protection that preserve dignity and respect for our veteran who serve in northern ireland armed forces recruitment and retention what step he be take to improve recruitment

be up compare with early and the army be see seven year high in application it may or may not come as surprise to the house that be once royal navy cadet believe that the cadet force be hugely important to retention and recruitment the trouble be get people to step forward to help run cadet force wonder whether the government will consider some form of inducement scheme to encourage veteran we know that every community have they to step forward and help organise the cadet the hon gentleman be role model for what someone can do by serve in the cadet force they be fantastic way of grow in confidence learn new skill and for many young people find career in the armed force support those people who work with our cadet and help train they be vital we know that there be huge opportunity in

employment support for the armed force community through op ascend free advice service for veteran and their family launch early this year we also continue to offer tailor employment support via the career transition partnership national insurance relief for employ veteran come at really quite low cost to the treasury but it be effective not just in its financial incentive but because it open up conversation within employer in write answer of late the government have be slightly equivocal about the future of the programme can the minister confirm that this programme of relief will continue to support veteran employment beyond the next year it be vital that we support our veteran we have extend the national insurance relief for further year be very happy to arrange conversation with the right hon gentleman and my treasury colleague if he would like to make further case and be sure he would join chorus of voice in do so in january in darlington william mcmullen canadian air pilot be fly plane across the densely populate town when it set fire he steer it away from the populated area and evacuate his six crew mate unfortunately lose his life in the process this act of heroism have

deepen their co operation on fishery and other maritime issue do that not show that labour policy of spend billion rent back military base that we already own be not only waste of taxpayer money but major risk to our national security no it show that when we be elect last summer we inherit situation of increase question and jeopardy over the continue sovereignty our operational sovereignty of the

after the interest of and to support veteran it be not for the mod hierarchy to dictate what they can or can not promote particularly through legitimate parliamentary engagement veteran voice must not be silence by bureaucratic interference be it appropriate mr speaker to pressurise regimental association to remove content that support democratic participation perhaps someone on the front bench would like to answer be grateful to the right hon gentleman for raise his point of order be not aware that he be go to raise it and have to say that it be news to most regimental association that know can not be pressure by anyone from outside however be grateful to he for raise the issue in the house anything that interfere with the parliamentary process be of concern to all member of the house and will certainly look into it and get back to he may say thank you to the secretary of state for answer that point of order it save from get involve but we recognise how important organisation be nobody should be stifle nhs and care volunteer responders service urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make statement regard the volunteer and care service thank the hon member for give the opportunity to speak about this topic and highlight the important role that volunteer play in our health and social care system the nhs have always benefit from the generous contribution make by volunteer who play vital role in support our patient staff and service we be grateful to the thousand of volunteer who donate their time to support the nhs in wide variety of role from help patient to leave hospital fast and settle in at home to support emergency cardiac incident and provide companionship to patient during end of life care the national nhs and care volunteer responder programme be first establish as part of the covid response and then adapt to respond to other organisational pressure however model that work well in that national crisis be no long the most cost effective way of facilitate the important contribution of our much value volunteer so nhs england have recently take the decision to close the current programme instead new central recruitment portal for nhs volunteer will be fully launch this year provide opportunity for the current pool of volunteer responder to continue to play their part volunteer will have have that information email to they recently nhs england will also work with nhs provider that draw on the support of the volunteer responder programme to ensure that they be help in develop other volunteering intervention that meet their service need the role of additional volunteer who be recruit and support by nhs trust directly will be unaffected by the closure of this programme that be in addition to many more thousand of volunteer who support the nhs either directly or indirectly via other local and national voluntary sector organisation successive volunteering programme in the nhs be primarily run locally by individual trust and integrate care system identify the good opportunity for volunteer intervention that meet their specific service need that mean local nhs action to build relationship with voluntary sector organisation and co develop volunteering programme and pathway that support patient staff and nhs service there will continue to be opportunity to strengthen and encourage innovation in nhs volunteering at national level the government recognise the need for sufficient and agile volunteering capacity and capability of support in particular scenario such as pandemic and flu season when the health and care sector be particularly stretch thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question at the start of the covid pandemic nhs volunteer responder be set up to support vulnerable people follow its success the previous government expand the scheme into adult social care form joint nhs and care volunteer programme that service have mobilise more than ordinary citizen who have complete more than million task and shift include more than million telephone support call million community response task and almost steward shift see at first hand as volunteer and doctor during the pandemic that nhs and social care team benefit from volunteer support and put on record my thank to all those who give up their time to support those around they out of nowhere the labour government have decide to cancel this service at the end of the month no task allocate after may will be complete seemingly leave patient in the lurch have the minister think about the real world implication of the additional pressure place on nhs local authority the loss of institutional knowledge and the impact on vulnerable patient what alternative measure be be put in place to support the people who be support by volunteer the minister say that something would be put in place later this year but when why leave gap the telephone helpline be open only until may so what happen if people need support after that will the minister explain why the decision be take so suddenly and which minister sign it off the volunteer website say that the decision be take due to financial pressure so can the minister tell we how much the scheme cost what be that cost as proportion of the total nhs budget the public accounts committee report publish last week on the reorganisation of nhs england be damn the secretary of state say he would devolve more resource and responsibility to the frontline to deliver well service for patient official report may vol however cancel the volunteer programme take service away from the frontline this seem to be yet another example of labour rush into decision without think they through properly and yet another promise break by this government at the expense of the most vulnerable people the hon lady be right to highlight the tremendous effort that go into establish the programme very quickly at time of great crisis and to thank the hundred of thousand of volunteer across the country who take part and step up it be huge effort to get the scheme run and we be all very grateful for it everyone learn great deal from that as outline in my initial response we will be take forward those lesson as we look at the role of volunteer in the future the hon lady say that the change have come out of nowhere they have not we be look critically across the piece as we fix the foundation of our nhs and ensure that it be fit for the future we be look at the most cost effective mean of deliver the same outcome which be why we will be move to centralised portal for part of this work we have email people about that some people may not have scroll to the bottom of that email where there be an option to push button to register their detail so that they will be update as new system come online and we can make sure that we do not lose that great volunteering spirit that be about digital technique for the future use the most cost effective mean and develop clear outcome do the minister agree with that as we rebuild our nhs volunteer at nhs trust will not be use to plug gap in service and staff will be allow to focus on clinical matter be happy to give my hon friend an absolute assurance volunteer support and complement the exist workforce they do not replace it include volunteer signal recognition of the important role they play in support staff service and patient many hon member be volunteer and we have all see how those volunteer can support the wide system however it be important that we keep our staff and respect their important role call the spokesperson for the liberal democrats be volunteer vaccination steward during the pandemic and the liberal democrats be hugely grateful to the thousand of volunteer who have make difference to the life of patient and vulnerable people in their community since the pandemic end their compassion and commitment have be inspire we be concerned that the end of the programme have be announce at extremely short notice there will be no further shift in just day time will the minister reassure the house that those currently receive help from the volunteer scheme such as collect prescription or fetch shopping will not be leave high and dry after next saturday have the department conduct an impact assessment if so will it publish it as with so many major decision such as drop cross party talk on social care or cut funding for integrate care board by it be concern that the government do not come to the house first to answer question from hon member will the minister reassure the house that these decision will improve patient care and that they be not just cost cut exercise dictate by the treasury thank the hon lady for her work volunteering and support the scheme during covid the announcement be about nhs england the organisation will continue to work with the nhs and voluntary organisation to ensure that where people be volunteer that will continue and that volunteer continue to be recruit ahead of full launch of the recruitment portal later this year on her wide point this government be not drop talk with other party about social care which be be take forward by the independent commission under louise casey pay tribute to all the volunteer across calder valley and the rest of the country who help with the fantastic vaccine roll out will the minister confirm that despite scaremongere from the conservatives people will of course still be able to volunteer for the nhs and support other this be good opportunity which very much welcome to highlight again how important volunteering be to the nhs and the care system it will remain an important part of our plan go forward that people may have have an email and think that something be stop and that there be not more to do but they should ensure that they press that button and register for upcoming opportunity and be in contact with their local nhs system as say volunteering be do locally and it be important that we support those local system and encourage more and more people to come forward to undertake this important work pay tribute to some of the volunteer across my constituency who make such difference to people life the minister will have notice that polling by more in common today find that more and more people feel disconnected from society that be compound by the fact that so many of our community space be struggle to make end meet as result of combination of business rate change national insurance rise and energy price rise those health and care volunteer make such difference by chat with those who be lonely and vulnerable in my constituency have the minister consider the impact of this decision particularly in the interim period on community such as mine what cost will not have this voluntary service to support people in their time of need drive into our health service agree with the hon lady about the role that people play particularly by have conversation and connect with people who feel disconnected to be very clear this decision be about particular arrangement it do not mean that thing be stop across our country or with local health system ensure that volunteer be still available we want to ensure that we use that knowledge in building system for the future be very pleased to host roundtable with organisation as part of our year plan process there be some fantastic idea and opportunity out there to use the knowledge we have learn particularly during covid to use technology to link with people and to recognise where people be not link by technology and ensure that they remain connected all of that will form part of our future plan before ask my question draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests be an unpaid trustee of helpforce charity that support volunteering in health and care and work with more than nhs partner to embed volunteer in trust as we have hear volunteer make huge contribution every day across the country give their time and skill to free up doctor and nurse to focus on their clinical task helpforce run scheme call volunteer to career which enable people to try out through volunteering before make the transition into frontline healthcare career do the minister agree that scheme such as helpforce volunteer to career programme could play huge role in fill some of the vacancy in nhs role and that volunteer will play central role in deliver the year nhs plan thank my hon friend for her work expertise and knowledge she be absolutely right she almost pre empte my answer that embed knowledge where it be need in the frontline in our community be exactly what we need to look to do and we need to recognise where we can use volunteer well we have micro volunteer these day which can help people to link in where it suit they so that we can take advantage of people do not mean take advantage that sound bad we can utilise people opportunity perhaps they be work different or irregular shift so that they can give more because we know that there be great appetite out there to support the system more this appear to be another rather muddle decision from the government the minister have acknowledge that these volunteer provide vital service but if they want to continue they now have the inconvenience of go to the new portal register and so on would it not have be well at least to maintain the current arrangement until new alternative be in place by the time we have provide extra support to medical professional and so on during the interim will it have save any money at all be afraid that have to disagree with the hon gentleman it be not muddle the analysis undertake by nhs england indicate that the current system be not provide good value for money and we be make sure that we produce something well for the future this government will continue to act in the good interest of volunteer patient and taxpayer in set up the nhs of the future congratulate all the volunteer in my constituency who do great job do the minister agree that the huge increase in volunteer over the past few year be because the conservatives run down the nhs now they be in opposition they can no long run down the nhs so they talk it down instead well we sorry the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford be chuntere from sedentary position partly agree with my hon friend yes the conservatives do run down the nhs and we inherit broken system but volunteering have always be really important part of the nhs and the care system so pay tribute to those people who come forward it be both good for the system and the people they help and for many individual we talk early about people feel disconnected perhaps as receiver of volunteering but we know how valuable it be for individual themselves to be give and volunteering and we want to see more of that this closure follow today no notice closure of the special care baby unit and maternity unit at yeovil district hospital and come amidst crisis in our health service take the opportunity to thank the hundred of nhs volunteer in glastonbury and somerton who give million of volunteer hour to the nhs but with nhs trust implement staffing freeze to keep afloat there do not seem to be any consideration of the impact that this closure might have how will the government ensure that patient do not lose access to vital support and suffer as result of these change the hon lady make an important point it be important to make sure that people do not suffer from change and that the impact be minimise as say the programme be not deliver effective value for money and we think the future system will we encourage more people to come forward to increase the sustainability of volunteering in local system it be no exaggeration to say that during the pandemic thousand of constituent be help out in volunteering role with the nhs and across their community in suffolk coastal will the minister reassure my constituent that those who want to play part in volunteering can continue to do so perhaps she would outline the step they can take to register their interest my hon friend be absolutely right we want to make sure that people in her constituency and all our constituency who have volunteer or who want to those who perhaps could not at the time but want to in the future can do so those who be already on the system and have receive an email can register via that portal and we will make sure it be easy for people to do so in future have be remind by note that people who volunteer in the very early week of the pandemic might have be on slightly different system from those who volunteer later on so think there will be slightly different process for they we do not want to lose they those who have receive an email can register through that portal but we will make sure that more opportunity be available when that be launch and will be happy to update the house when that happen take this opportunity to say massive thank you to all the nhs volunteer across the country but especially those in westmorland it be privilege to join with they alongside my child actually to deliver prescription during that period but the work of the volunteer in the nhs be not over in community such as mine we particularly depend on volunteer driver to help people in rural community who live hour away from hospital or from doctor appointment as such will the minister take this opportunity to direct integrate care board and trust in cumbria to support those volunteer driver so that volunteer be value and patient be not isolate the hon gentleman make an excellent point on behalf of his community as well as rural community more widely about the role of volunteer driver we need volunteer driver across range of area in fact my husband be out volunteering as speak drive for another charity we need more of these people there be plenty of opportunity for people who have time and nhs england will continue to work with icb to make sure we take forward the good of what we already have into the rest of the nhs thank the minister for her answer so far prior to my election spend year run volunteer programme in the nhs include during covid and the covid response we should thank not only all the volunteer who have be involve but those who run the volunteer programme locally local infrastructure be important it be all well and good have national system but where the infrastructure work well the system work well where the system do not work well it be due to lack of local infrastructure what step be the minister put in place to ensure that local infrastructure can support volunteering and make thing well for all those who contribute thank my hon friend for that contribution and her service in that role she be absolutely right to highlight not just the people who come forward but the people who run that local infrastructure as say in my opening remark much of this work be do at local level the learning we must take from what the national scheme do be how we bring that together in crisis we want to make sure that the learning be spread across the country and that we can use digital technology and portal where that suit the many people come forward she be absolutely right about local infrastructure and people to make sure thing happen they be well place to know where the service gap be and where the people be who can support they they provide an important link we will make sure that that be part of our year plan thank the minister for her answer the importance of the work of the voluntary sector in the nhs can not ever be overstate whether it be those who volunteer to help people find their way around the hospital maze those who provide vital phone support and work within community or the volunteer in hospital radio it be huge loss and the question be clear who will replace these volunteer and the support they have give which have make such difference to so many at time of vulnerability when they need it most the hon member be absolutely right we should be clear that the nhs and the care system need people he be right about many hospital be maze and the importance of that friendly face to greet someone when they go into hospital they be knowledgeable and know that most people go into hospital not for good reason so they recognise the anxiety people have when they enter those place we know the cheer that be bring by hospital radio and so on just gently correct the hon member we be not lose the volunteer this be change to contractual arrangement so the volunteer be still there we still want to make sure that they come forward as we have discuss volunteering be more generally handle by local situation and this be about the good way we can get the national system to spread into local system we need the local infrastructure and we need to keep encourage people to come forward hope that as result of this urgent question this afternoon we be highlight the role of volunteer and that more people will come forward echo the comment make today about the huge contribution that volunteer make up and down the country help and support nhs staff day in day out declare bit of an interest as someone who similarly start their volunteer journey with the responder programme and continue now as community first responder with my local ambulance service can the minister reassure that those who wish to continue to play their part and to carry on volunteering in other way with the nhs can do so will she join in take the opportunity to encourage those who be interested in volunteer to check for opportunity with their local trust we be learn so much about each other this afternoon be we not be pleased to hear that that be how my hon friend start her journey and be so impressed that she be continue to do that be out with the ambulance service last week talk to staff who highly praise those community first responder the work that she and other be do be valuable and know she will continue to use that knowledge to feed into the work we want to do in the future thank the minister for answer the urgent question may pay tribute to the many volunteer in harlow both those who support people during the pandemic and in particular the butterfly volunteers who support people receive end of life care at princess alexandra hospital feel emotional just think about that they do we find that it be good to seek volunteer locally in harlow both through rainbow services and through the volunteer co ordinator della nash who be wonderful but who sadly be make redundant by the last government how can local charity and other organisation feed into the government portal once it be up and run thank my hon friend for what he have say and thank the butterfly volunteers support people at that really important end of life stage be hard and critical work and commend they for it the local link be also critical we need to ensure that people can be direct from the national system to local system through nhs england and perhaps if it be appropriate mr speaker through the house it be in the interest of local members of parliament for we to ensure that what we have learn from the national scheme be continue into the local scheme and as my hon friend say we need the local co ordination and infrastructure about which we have hear this afternoon on point of order mr speaker notwithstanding the response to the urgent question that you be kind enough to grant we still have no idea how long the gap in the service will last or what will happen to the most vulnerable people who be use it what other parliamentary mechanism could use to secure the answer to these question think that in fairness can not allow the debate to continue which be what think the hon lady be try to tempt towards what would say however be that be sure that the good office around she will give some very strong advice be sure that the table office and other will be able to advise she on how she can pursue this matter and be sure that those on the front bench have hear her point of order national security act charge before call the home secretary to make her statement must remind the house that the resolution of the house relate to matter that be sub judice prohibit any reference to case in which an individual have be charge three man have be charge with offence under the national security act and the matter be therefore sub judice however since this case concern matter of national importance and it be in the public interest for the house to hear from the home secretary be grant limited waiver for the purpose of this statement only to allow discussion of the wide security issue member should exercise high degree of caution in their remark and take every care to avoid say anything that could potentially prejudice the criminal trial with permission mr speaker will make statement about the charging of three individual under the national security act that take place on may and the further action that the government be take to counter national security threat want to thank the police and the security and intelligence agency not just for their work on the vital operation and investigation that be currently under way but for the dedication that they show each day to defend our national security and keep our community safe their tireless work often in the shadow often in secret and often in great personal danger be indispensable and hope that the whole house will join in pay tribute

scheme which be due to come into effect on july the government have also introduce sanction as part of effort to systematically dismantle the criminal network and enabler that iran use to carry out its work include the foxtrot network which be sanction last month international co operation be critical in challenge iranian transnational threat which be why we be convene ministerial counterpart

increase complexity of the threat we face threat from extremist and terrorist group and individual include from islamist extremism and far right extremism continue and vigilance and action against they remain crucial but malign activity against we by or on behalf of foreign state have grow and the threat we face have become more complex and intertwine state threat investigation have increase by nearly in year and police investigation into state threat lead by counter terrorism police be up fivefold since as well as grow those threat be become more interconnected and the old boundary between

about their daily life freely and without fear we have of course support the national security act which be rightly bring in by the previous government but we need to go far that be why commission

proscription power because have long raise concern that it be too difficult to apply exist power to state and state back body today mr hall have publish his review and thank he for work so swiftly and

current national security act power in allow we to restrict the activity and operation of foreign state back organisation in the uk include new criminal offence for individual who invite support for or promote the group in question we will not hesitate to use the power against organisation that pose threat to uk resident because we will not stand for foreign state organisation seek to escalate threat on uk soil as be confirm at the weekend the three individual who have be charge come to the uk between and by lorry and small boat this government have make it clear that border security be national security which be why we be introduce new counter terrorism power at the border however let also be clear that our border security need to be strengthen those involve in organised crime malign state actor and extremist can all exploit any vulnerability so the border security asylum and immigration bill be introduce wide range of counter terrorism style power to pursue organise immigration crime and strengthen border investigation we have introduce the border security command which be draw together security operation around our border that have not be take seriously enough before model on the approach that successive government have take to counter terrorism as part of our exist ct capability security identity and criminal record check be carry out on everyone who apply for visa through our immigration system on identify clandestine entry and on those who arrive by small boat so that immigration and counter terrorism power can then be use to address threat include refusal restriction tagging heighten monitoring and immigration bail however have instruct official to review those capability against the state threat as well as the terrorism relate risk we face so that we can strengthen our security response alongside the new counter terrorism style border power that we be introduce we be already review our current response to criminality or threat in the asylum system include the potential for great use of range of technique and technology as well as the exist ability to revoke or refuse asylum finally in the face of this increase range of hybrid threat to our national security the prime minister have commit to publish new national security strategy the strategy which be in development will set out how not just our world lead police and security and intelligence agency but the whole of government and society include business and community need to respond to these change and complex threat national security be the first duty of government and it be the foundation of our plan for change the threat we face be more intertwine than ever and our response need to adapt together with our international ally we need to face down the security threat and strengthen the power and capability of the police and security service who work around the clock to investigate and disrupt those who mean we harm our agency have the wholehearte support of this government because in volatile and uncertain world their effort could not matter more commend this statement to the house call the shadow home secretary thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement join she in pay tribute to counter terrorism policing and the security service for the work they do daily to keep we safe let straightaway put on the record that the opposition support the government plan to place iran into the enhance tier of the firs regime and we will also support the move they wish to make to increase proscription power and any other power that be necessary to keep we safe we will support those measure the whole house should be in no doubt about the malign influence that iran spread around the world it be responsible for support hamas who perpetrate the sicken massacre on october iran take western hostage include nazanin zaghari ratcliffe who be hold in squalid condition for year iran support the houthis who have attack and try to sink civilian merchant shipping in the red sea as part of their war against the saudi back internationally recognise government in ukraine we see iranian drone and military equipment use by putin to murder ukrainians and far russia illegal invasion of course iran also threaten to acquire nuclear weapon iran also persecute its own people woman be abuse imprison and in some case even kill for not adhere to the behaviour demand by the ayatollah twenty two year old mahsa amini be arrest and kill by the iranian religious police simply for wear what she want and be sure every single member of this house will condemn that atrocity people who be gay in iran be persecute and sometimes kill and those who oppose the iranian regime be brutally oppress and often murder we should be in no doubt about the threat that the iranian regime pose to its own people and to international peace the tentacle of the iranian state now stretch on to our very own soil here in the united kingdom iran international tv an independent tv channel have to temporarily locate to the us not long ago because its premise and people here be threaten by iranian agent iranian dissident on uk soil be threaten and harass and as the home secretary set out just two week ago eight iranian national be arrest while planning attack on uk soil in opposition the home secretary say that she would proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps she say so number of time include from this very dispatch box on april last year the home secretary have now be in office for nearly year so my first question be this why have she not yet do what she say she would do by proscribe the irgc she say that the iranian ambassador have be summon that be not an adequate response why have iranian diplomat include any suspect of support espionage activity not be expel what further step can be take to develop international sanction against the iranian regime the home secretary confirm that the three individual charge over the weekend enter the uk illegally include by small boat as recently as march this year just few week ago think it be on march extremist abu wadee enter the uk by small boat he have previously be picture on social medium wield an throw pipe bomb and call for the slaughter of jews this be the kind of illegal immigrant who be able to enter the country by small boat the home secretary talk about her new bill which we debate week ago today but the truth be that it will not make very much difference confiscate mobile phone from illegal immigrant and slightly enhance power to monitor communication will not stop the crossing the border security commander have no actual power other than to publish an annual report and set some strategic objective do not think people smuggler be go to worry too much about that what will stop the crossing be proper deterrent so that all those who arrive not just some but all those who arrive be remove then they will not bother to attempt the crossing in the first place this deterrent approach work in australia about year ago the home secretary must by now be regret the decision to cancel the rwanda deterrent before it even start crossing since she become home secretary be up by year on year and so far have be the bad in history do she finally agree that it be time to follow other country and establish proper removal deterrent apply to all those who arrive illegally by small boat it be time to bring back rwanda in their first six month in office the government have not return single iranian to iran not one include iranian criminal do the home secretary agree that it be now time to repeal the human rights act for immigration matter so that criminal and other dangerous people can be more easily remove from the uk and can no long persuade uk judge to allow they to stay here on ever more tenuous human right ground the only way to protect our border and ensure security be to remove all illegal immigrant as soon as they arrive hope she urgently adopt that policy just say to the shadow home secretary that he be an immigration minister when the number of small boat crossing soar and when net migration soar on his watch control be reduce under his party we see return plummet this government be clear that the rule need to be respect and enforce that be why this government be introduce counter terrorism style power to strengthen our border security something that his party shockingly have repeatedly vote against the right hon gentleman still refer to his rwanda scheme which cost million and in the two year that it be operational send four volunteer just four volunteer to rwanda border security be part of our national security frankly be sorry that the right hon gentleman be not take sufficiently seriously the national security threat that we face support the work that his government do to introduce the national security act but as he will know warn repeatedly that the power be not strong enough and that we could not use legislation design for terrorism to proscribe state back organisation we call on his government repeatedly if they be unable to proscribe the irgc to strengthen and amend the power to be able to do so under national security provision in fact we even put forward an amendment to the national security act in the previous parliament and the conservatives vote against it be glad that the right hon gentleman now say he will support our measure to strengthen our national security and bring forward strong proscribe power that can be use against all kind of state or state back organisation that might attempt to do we harm our national security be the first duty of any government which be why this government will continue to take ever strong action to pursue issue around criminality and extremist or terrorist border and national security threat that be how we keep our community safe give the wide range of threat that we face from hostile state actor it be more important than ever that we protect ourselves from state back cyber attack and similar threat can the home secretary update we on what be be do to increase the nation resilience and countermeasure against such attack my hon friend be right because the complex national security threat that we face now take different form and be increasingly intertwine cyber threat and the use of technology be increasingly part of those threat work on that will form central part of the new national security strategy that the prime minister have announce which be be develop at the moment so that we recognise the interplay between these different threat call the liberal democrat spokesperson be grateful to the home secretary for advance sight of her statement the liberal democrats remain extremely grateful to all the extraordinary people from our police intelligence and security service who continue to put themselves at risk to keep our country safe we support the action take by the government so far and stand ready to support further robust sanction and other action against cowardly regime that seek to destabilise our and other western democracy we last discuss the threat pose by the iranian regime in this chamber couple of week ago in response to question about the proscribing of the irgc the minister for security the hon member for barnsley north dan jarvis refer to the work undertake by jonathan hall kc to review the legislation we have in place and it be good to hear that that review have be publish today the home secretary mention plan change that will be make and additional power that will be introduce to respond to the legal difficulty in use power design to deal with terrorist group for state and state back organisation such as the irgc could she confirm that these new plan power will finally enable we to proscribe the irgc would be grateful if she could update the house on the timetable she foresee for bring forward those change and give the difficulty with previous counter terror law if she could tell the house whether any of those change will be subject to the appropriate pre legislative scrutiny our democracy have face and continue to face systematic threat from hostile foreign state not just from iran but from china and russia now that our police and security service have have chance to use the provision in the national security act could the home secretary update the house on any further gap they have find during their work we live in perilous world with war on our continent and we liberal democrats welcome the increase in defence spending however the decision to take that money from the official development assistance budget will leave vacuum in some of the most vulnerable place we know that china and russia be seek to fill that void and iran will undoubtedly try to do the same what assessment have the government make of malign actor use their soft power to influence event overseas and the result threat to our national security thank the hon member for her comment and her support for the police and the intelligence and security agency she ask about the irgc in his report jonathan hall state specifically that under the exist legal framework there be significant challenge when it come to try to take restriction or ban action against state back and state organisation there be legal challenge to do that and he refer particularly to the irgc in that context that be why he set out the need for new power and we be commit to bring those in obviously we will need to follow the process by bring in the new legislation but continue to be concern about the irgc the hon member be also right to highlight threat from russia and the different kind of threat and challenge from china in his report jonathan hall identify other area where power could be strengthen include stop and search cordon and post charge questioning in specific circumstance we will be look at the detail in order to take forward all the recommendation and the issue that be raise the charging of iranian national raise alarm question about the extent of iranian state activity in the uk we know that tehran use the irgc to push its influence around the world include by support attack against jewish people and israelis around the world what assessment have the government make of the threat pose to the british jewish community by iranian operative what step be be take to protect the community and eliminate those threat my hon friend be right to mention the importance of security for our jewish community which should never be compromise either domestically or by any kind of foreign state influence or activity that be why we work very closely with the community security trust on range of issue around support and protection for the jewish community across the uk and why we take immensely seriously any malign iranian influence that be target towards jewish community the home secretary rightly say that the threat from hostile state be complex and intertwine so will she update the house on what further step the government have take to protect critical national infrastructure in particular from cyber attack our security service commit vast expertise in our protection their success must be hide but their failure be often pick over the one thing they really need be additional resource and urge the home secretary to make the case for that vigorously during the forthcoming spending review that be the least they deserve from this house know that the right hon member take these issue immensely seriously when he be in government agree with he about the importance of critical national infrastructure and the implication of cyber attack know that he will agree that the critical national infrastructure be change what be critical now be different from what might have be critical even year ago let alone or year ago we need to have the process to be able to adapt swiftly and that will be consider as part of the national security review he can be assure that will always argue strongly for support for our intelligence and security agency thank the home secretary for her statement in particular on the outcome of the jonathan hall review and the step be take to proscribe the irgc it be very sad that the previous conservative government fail to do that in year while we wait for the legislation will she reassure the house by reaffirm that anyone in the uk who fail to declare relationship with the iranian regime be commit criminal offence my hon friend be right that be exactly the reason we have put the irgc on the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme alongside the whole of the iranian state we expect people to abide by that law and there will be criminal offence if they do not the home secretary may be aware of visit make to iran international just few week ago during which it express its appreciation for the fantastic support it have receive from the metropolitan police and security service if she have not already do so will she or the minister for security visit iran international in order to send the message that threat to its journalist and those of the bbc persian service be utterly unacceptable as be threat to their family base in iran thank the right hon member for his important question threat to iran international its journalist and their family member be disgraceful and completely unacceptable he be right to commend the work of counter terrorism police and the security service in address this issue we take the safety of anyone on uk soil immensely seriously and no threat to the safety of any individual and certainly any organisation or journalist will ever be acceptable in the uk thank the home secretary for this important statement and thank our security service the fine in the world for keep we safe it be important that we have tool to assess the threat or potential threat pose by those who arrive through irregular mean such as small boat can the home secretary update the house on progress make to intelligence sharing with our international partner my hon friend raise an important issue in order to address transnational and international threat network and challenge whatever form or route they take it be immensely important that we strengthen co operation and work with our international ally we be already work to strengthen international co operation and information sharing but we be look far at what check and security assessment we can do in the uk the british people will be appal to learn that iranian national who have come across the english channel have be charge with terror offence they will also be concern that the home secretary talk in opposition about proscribe the irgc but now we have jonathan hall kc recommend delay in proscribe the irgc surely the right thing to do be proscribe it now and if any more power be require introduce they through emergency legislation but we must not kick the can down the road our border security be national security that be the approach the government be take we will continue to strengthen border security include by introduce counter terrorism power when in opposition repeatedly call on the previous government to strengthen the legislation in order to be able to take much strong action on state back organisation like the irgc the jonathan hall report that be out today identify the legal difficulty and problem with apply legislation that be design for terrorism to state back threat it be important that any legislation we apply be actually effective and do not unravel that be why some year ago in the labour party put forward proposal to strengthen the legislation and bring in the new strong power that we be talk about for use against organisation that be state back such as the irgc it be because we believe that national security be so important that we be prepared to give the government police and security agency the power they need to take action and make sure that something happen in practice thank the home secretary for her statement and put on record my thank to those who work day in day out to keep our street and community safe and who undertake work and activity that many of we may never hear about can the home secretary assure the house that with this government the police and security service will always have the power and resource that they need to keep we safe my hon friend be right to talk about the vital work that the police and the security and intelligence service do it be because we support they so strongly that we be put forward proposal to strengthen the law so that they have the power they need at all stage to keep we safe we understand that the three individual concern enter the country illegally and then claim asylum do the home secretary agree that this country be particularly attractive to those who wish to claim asylum because it be relatively easy to be successful in that endeavour compare with for example france so it make sense to claim asylum here do she attribute any of that to the human rights act if so how do she plan to amend it do she have cause for concern that those who be task with make decision be sometimes guilty of overzealous application of the law in respect of asylum the three individual that the right hon member refer to enter the uk between and and be grant asylum grant rate for asylum have fall in the last year and return of fail asylum seeker have increase we be strengthen our border security with counter terrorism power and strengthen the check around criminality across the immigration and asylum system thank the home secretary for her statement and the security minister for his write statement last week on the work of the defend democracy taskforce as the home secretary will be aware the joint committee on human rights be conduct an inquiry into transnational repression be sure that she will look at our finding carefully will the state threat joint unit bring cross government approach to the work on transnational repression so that we can tackle this important issue my hon friend raise an important point the inquiry that his committee be pursue be important the security minister will give evidence to that inquiry about the work be do on transnational repression include the work of the defend democracy taskforce the state threat joint unit be look at wide range of issue in respect of how we tackle the threat we face across the country as president trump seek to negotiate nuclear deal with iran may ask the home secretary along with senior ministers across government to work with five eyes partner and the national security council and national security adviser team in the white house to ensure that any deal be comprehensive it must not exclude ensure that iran can not continue to work in proxy form whether through criminal gang or other state in order that we do not have sanction lift without further action in the area that she have discuss today the right hon member make an extremely important point it be essential that iran be prevent from develop any further nuclear threat that be why the us lead talk be so important we support they strongly he be right that this need to be comprehensive approach and we agree with the approach across the five eyes partner associate myself with the praise for our intelligence police and security service welcome the home secretary statement about the combination of international co operation and robust action at home as be set out previously by the security minister which be critical when tackle allege act of direct threat to life and property do the home secretary agree that measure such as the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme be really important because we be increasingly see action by organise criminal gang and other group which be an insidious force in our country and we must deter other state and organisation from the nefarious action that they be take my hon friend be right we be increasingly see pattern where foreign state organisation end up use criminal proxy to pursue malign activity that be why we have to link up the work around serious and organised crime with work around counter terrorism and work around state threat it be about combine the different hybrid threat that we now face which be why the new national security strategy be so important the home secretary say in her statement the iranian regime pose an unacceptable threat to our domestic security which can not continue yet we know that iranians make up the third large group of illegal migrant crossing channel so do the home secretary agree that any iranians cross the channel should be detain and deport and should not be allow to claim asylum the system that we inherit from the previous government include government that the hon member be at different time part of be not strong enough border security need to be treat as national security issue but it have not be for far too long that be why we be introduce counter terrorism style power as part of our border security response be really sorry that he and his party repeatedly choose to vote against those counter terrorism power because we need those power to be introduce we be also strengthen the security and criminality check across the asylum and immigration system because we need to make sure that we be do everything possible to keep our country safe welcome the measure that my right hon friend have announce today join she in pay tribute to the security service and thank they for keep we safe the action of the last few day have underline the profound threat that iran pose to our country many of the iranian community in my constituency of hendon live in fear of transnational repression could my right hon friend say more about what the government be do to protect our iranian community and all those who live in fear of transnational repression so that they can live their life in freedom in britain my hon friend be right to say that transnational repression have become grow threat and challenge not just from iran but from other country the security minister provide an update to the house just last week on the further action that we be take include further support for those who be be target and further advice and guidance for those who face threat those be the kind of threat that our police and security service be particularly vigilant towards to ensure that everyone in our country can feel confident that they will be keep safe can the home secretary explain why the british envoy in tehran be summon by the iranian authority at the weekend more importantly do this not signal complete disconnect from reality on the part of the iranian state the hon member be right to raise this we have make extremely clear to the iranian regime our view about the unacceptability of state back threat on our soil include through the summoning of the iranian ambassador to the uk and through further measure not just in the foreign influence registration scheme but those we be now go to take forward in response to jonathan hall report it be immensely important that the iranian regime hear the point that we be raise and that it understand our determination to protect the security of those on uk soil thank the home secretary for her statement today and for the work that she and her ministers have do on this really important issue also want to put on record my thank and the thank of the people of harlow for the work that the police and security service do to keep we all safe do she agree that as the method of state back agent change and adapt we too need to change and adapt be think in particular of what my hon friend the member for dover and deal mike tapp say about intelligence gathering and the jonathan hall report will be an important part of that my hon friend be right the jonathan hall report identify series of area where we have long stand counter terrorism power that go far than the power we have around state back threat that might be something as simple as the power for the police to set up cordon around the target of potential terrorist incident and they should have the same ability to do that for the potential target of state threat incident we will be look to take forward those power but in order to use they most effectively we also need the good intelligence gathering we already have the good security and intelligence agency in the world but they need to be able to work ever more strongly with international partner too thank the secretary of state for her strong and determined word and action we appreciate they offer my thank to the counter terrorism unit for its work on the case know that this be the tip of the iceberg of the work be carry out unseen to keep we all safe across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the arrest of these three asylum seeker will naturally highlight the failing in the system and say that regardless of which party be in power at various time through that journey what action will the secretary of state and this government take regard the influx of young single man claim asylum who seem empower to declare war against this nation that have feed and clothe they for so many year how do we assure our british public my british public that the end have come to housing these foreign national who hate this nation and all it stand for the hon member be right to pay tribute to the police and the security and intelligence service he will know more than many in this house the complexity and wide range of different threat that our agency have have to deal with through the year they continue to need to deal with terrorist threat from islamist extremism to far right extremism they have of course have to deal over many year with northern ireland terror threat and they have to deal with change pattern of state threat the different form those threat can take and the way in which they interact with criminality this government have make it clear that we see border security as part of national security that be something the prime minister say in his speech to interpol before christmas and it be why we be strengthen the counter terrorism style power we be use and bring forward through this house we be also strengthen international co operation we hold the first ever international summit on organise immigration crime because we see that as national security issue too legal aid agency cyber security incident with permission will make statement about an incident that have affect the legal aid agency an executive agency of the ministry of justice the house will appreciate that while investigation be ongoing there be limit to the amount of information that can share publicly however the government wish to be as transparent as possible with parliament and will provide an update base on the information that we currently have on wednesday april the legal aid agency become aware of cyber attack on its online digital service these be the service through which legal aid provider log their work and receive payment from the government the government of course take immediate action to bolster the security of the system work closely with expert at the national crime agency the government cyber co ordination centre and the national cyber security centre we alert the information commissioner and importantly inform all legal aid provider that some of their detail have be compromise we also take some legal aid agency system offline between and may to carry out work to contain the breach official have be work around the clock to stabilise the system and support complex investigation can now confirm that the cyber attack be more extensive than originally think on friday may we learn from the attacker behind it that they have access large amount of information relate to legal aid applicant and we assess that threat to be credible we believe they have access and download significant amount of personal datum from those who apply for legal aid through our digital service some time since that datum may include applicant contact detail address date of birth national id number criminal history employment status and financial datum such as contribution amount debt and payment should stress that this do not mean that every individual involve will be impact in the same way but we need to act to safeguard the service and its user in line with advice from the national cyber security centre the legal aid agency take its online service down on friday urge all member of the public who have apply for legal aid since to be on high alert for any suspicious activity that include message and phone call from unknown number if anyone be in any doubt at all please take step to verify person identity before provide any information understand the gravity of these event at this stage we believe that the breach be contain to the legal aid agency system there be no indication that other part of the justice system have be impact the government be commit to make every effort to ensure that the vital operational delivery of legal aid continue we have put in place contingency plan to ensure that those most in need of legal support can continue to access the help that they need the house should be in no doubt that the legal aid agency have suffer an unacceptable attack on its system at the hand of criminal sadly that attack be not altogether surprising the vulnerability in the legal aid agency system have be know for many year the risk of such an attack be steadily grow during through the previous government tenure but they take no meaningful action to fix the system leave they vulnerable to attack the previous government be repeatedly warn about the legal aid agency system be old inflexible and unstable in the law society call on the government to urgently invest in the legal aid agency digital system say that the system be too fragile to cope in march the law society point to the agency antiquated it system as evidence of the long term neglect of our justice system in short this data breach be make possible by the long year of neglect and mismanagement of the justice system under the last conservative government they know about the vulnerability of the legal aid agency digital system but do not act by contrast since take office this government have prioritise work to reverse the damage of over decade of under investment that include the allocation of over million in extra funding this year to stabilise and transform the legal aid agency digital service be extremely grateful to legal aid provider across the country for their patience and co operation and to ministry of justice official for their ongoing effort to secure the system the investigation be live and the government will do everything we can to seek justice recent event have show that every organisation no matter how big or small be at risk from this type of criminal behaviour sadly the government be not exempt this incident have none the less demonstrate in stark term that our legal aid digital system be critically fragile and not fit for the century when take up this ministerial role be frankly shock to see just how fragile they be this government inherit legal aid sector that have be neglect for far too long we have invest in stabilise the current digital system and have kick start an ambitious reform programme to transform they that mean create modern user friendly and resilient service the programme will also deliver more flexible service so that we can implement change fast and well respond to change demand that transformation will take time in the light of this incredibly serious incident my right hon friend the lord chancellor and be explore option to expedite the programme and put our system on more secure footing the government will not hesitate to act to protect our vital public service because without legal aid our justice system would grind to halt this be an ongoing and sensitive issue and our investigation and mitigate action continue to ensure that member be inform and update will provide write update in due course commend this statement to the house call shadow minister dr kieran mullan thank the minister for advance sight of her statement although it be pretty disappointing to hear she deliver it as write before have see her statement draft one of my own in it be clear that would limit my party political remark and think that the minister would devote significant part of her statement to condemn the immoral malicious criminal actor who be responsible for this attack intend to begin with strong word of support for what she say however if member listen closely they would have hear that she devote most of her time to party political attack and manage barely one sentence of condemnation suggest that she look at her statement when she leave the chamber and reflect on that will say what the minister should have say to all those worry by what have happen include those who may be victim of fraud as result and taxpayer who will pick up the bill we should never lose sight of the fact that whatever the role of any government past or present in unsuccessfully defend against such attack the primary responsibility for this lie with the despicable criminal who carry it out this be not just an attack on digital system it be an attack on some of the most vulnerable in our society their datum be deeply personal in some case give that sensitive medical record have be expose it be utterly appalling we welcome the fact that the national crime agency and the national cyber security centre be involve and hope that the minister will agree that those behind this breach must be bring to justice nothing should stand in the way of full accountability for this crime address the action of those behind the attack be paramount the minister may seek to focus blame on previous government but have question about this government response first why be the decision take not to inform the house and the public about the breach when it be first discover on april we now learn that the impact may extend to those who make application as far back as and that more than million piece of information have be access the delay of nearly month in notify the public understand the nature of the attack could have hinder individual from take necessary step to protect themselves from potential harm such as fraud or harassment secondly the minister mention take system offline that be crucial for legal professional payment can she provide clear update on the operational status of those system if they be not yet fully functional what be the estimate timeline for their restoration she mention contingency plan could she tell we more about their nature thirdly can she share any information about the origin of this attack be it believe to be state link criminal enterprise fourthly have the ministry of justice initiate thorough risk assessment of its other digital system and digital system across government more widely she say that the government believe that the attack be contain but on what basis have she reach that conclusion fifthly the minister talk about the million set aside for deliver improve system she will know the challenge that previous government face in attempt to upgrade those system what specific improvement will be achieve by this funding and when finally will the minister give commitment to full transparency for the house through regular update as the investigation progress she mention seek to make the public more aware of the issue so that people know if they might be affect will she ensure that those affect by this breach be directly contact and offer appropriate support will she reiterate the government commitment to ensure that those responsible be bring to justice the security of our justice system public confidence and the wellbeing of vulnerable individual depend on robust and transparent response to this serious incident the hon member be right to say that those responsible for this attack on our justice system be criminal no ifs no but what they have perpetrate on our legal aid system be not only dangerous it expose the datum of legal aid provider and applicant the threat make to the government be entirely unacceptable and malicious and the government will be robust in their response and in pursue justice think make that clear in my statement it be important that we be honest and frank about the vulnerability of the legacy it system that support our legal aid system the vulnerability of that system expose both legal aid provider and end user as the hon member say some of the most vulnerable people in our society to unacceptable risk be focus on the short term and eliminate the threat but also on the long term on invest in resilience and on the rescue and transformation of the platform so that we who be responsible for the legal aid system and our wide justice system do not expose people to that risk again the hon member ask why the house be not inform when ministers be inform in late april the reason for that be simple when ministers be first inform about the exposure of the legal aid agency digital platform to this risk the full extent of the risk and the nature and extent of the datum put at risk be not fully understand as minister have compete responsibility have responsibility to keep the legal aid system go to ensure that those who need to access legal support can do so and that those provide legal aid to vulnerable client be pay at that point give the understand risk the responsibility to keep the system go outweigh any need to inform the house of the exposure of the system however the most important people in the system the legal aid provider and by extension their client be inform as be the information commissioner whom we be legally oblige to inform when the great extent of the risk become know we promptly and transparently inform the house of the position that be transparent and proportionate response to our understanding of the evolve criminal theat the shadow minister ask about the restoration of the system the system have be close down to negate the threat and prevent further exposure of legal aid provider and user we will not reopen the system until we be satisfied that it be safe to do so as he will understand can not comment far on this live and sensitive situation however can assure he that we have put in place contingency plan to ensure that those who need to apply for legal support in the come day and week and those who be currently access legal aid can provide information to the legal aid agency through alternative mean so that we can keep the show on the road the shadow minister ask about wide government exposure to any risk as have mention regrettably government departments local authority university and our well know business be expose to the sort of criminal activity that the legal aid agency have experience but from what we know this attack be confine to the legal aid agency and go no wide than that he ask about our long term plan as have say our long term plan involve significant investment of million to stabilise and transform the service indeed we know about today threat partly because of the investment that we have make since we come into government we discover the threat and become alive to the fact that hacker be infiltrate the system partly because of the work that we be do to stabilise and transform the system that work have to continue the lord chancellor and will look at whether we can expedite some of that work to bake resilience into the system the shadow minister ask about full transparency and keep the house up to date as say will provide write update in due course and today can undertake to provide full transparency legal aid provider have be keep fully inform along the way as have our professional body such as the law society and the bar council many of which be legal aid provider that be because we need all of they work in robust system to deliver the justice and legal aid that people so sorely need call the chair of the justice committee the loss of very sensitive datum relate to so many vulnerable people over such long time make this one of the most serious data breach of recent year it be also wake up call alert we to the poor state of the legal aid agency it system and perhaps government it system more generally appreciate that the minister have inherit this debacle but it be on her desk now will she confirm the number affect whether the leak have be stem and what step be be take to recover the datum from the thief who have take it have more question that there be not time to deal with here she say that she will provide write statement but will she also brief the select committee and the opposition party if necessary in confidence on the step be take to rectify the situation thank my hon friend for that pertinent question he will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for to comment in any great detail while the investigation be ongoing as he and the rest of the house can imagine if we be talk about those who have apply for or be in receipt of legal aid since and all the legal provider in this country that have have legal aid contract with the government one get sense of the scale of the exposure it be very serious breach indeed the malign criminal who be responsible for the hack have give figure for the amount of datum that they have which have be trail in some of the newspaper those who have read the paper will know that it be in the region of million item of datum so one can see that the scale of the problem be very serious indeed should say that that figure can not be verify and will not comment in further detail with respect to my hon friend request that the jsc and opposition party be keep up to date as the investigation develop and as we take step to eliminate this risk from our system be very happy to give that update call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of her statement hundred of thousand of people across the country include many in my patch of eastbourne will be hugely concerned that their information be in the hand of deplorable criminal whose identity we do not know and whose further intention be unclear and who should face the full force of the law the damage be especially profound because the state inability to steward the public datum undermine people trust in our justice system more than that give that legal aid applicant be the victim the data breach risk disproportionately undermine the trust of some of the most vulnerable people in our society the previous government should hang their head in shame for ignore the law society call to address those vulnerability when they have the chance this government must urgently restore trust and have few question in pursuit of that first how will the minister proactively communicate with all those affect about this breach to provide guidance and support secondly will she consider launch dedicated advice line for example for anyone who be worried about what it mean for they thirdly the legal aid agency service be take offline last friday as the minister confirm so how will she ensure that that do not compromise people access to legal aid in the meantime finally will the government conduct cyber security review of all the system they use across their remit to identify and address further vulnerability before they be exploit at the expense of our constituent the hon gentleman be absolutely right that incident such as this perpetrate by cyber criminal represent an attack on our justice system and be corrosive of trust he be also absolutely right that in so do they be hit some of the most vulnerable in our society that anger frankly and the response need to be commensurate to the damage that they have do not just in steal people private datum but to the wide system in undermine trust we be take proactive approach to communicate with people and with the sector as soon as the risk and the exposure of the system to these hacker be identify legal aid provider be update on their exposure and tell to take proactive security step that communication have be update and as well as today public statement we be in constant communication with those legal aid provider they be really the most important point of contact because they have relationship of trust with their client and they will be invite to pass on the warning and message come from the government where we know of particular individual whose datum may have be expose and who may be particularly vulnerable we be communicate directly with they will take away the hon gentleman suggestion of an advice line but for now what have describe will be the most important and effective way of disseminate the warning and keep people up to date as the situation evolve turn to the wide security threat to government and other vulnerability before this attack we have indicate in any event that we would have new national cyber strategy across government by the end of the year obviously we also intend to introduce the cyber security and resilience bill which aim to improve and strengthen government cyber defence and government response to attack just like this one all of that be go to be important to improve the resilience not just of the legal aid agency but of cyber system right across government recent public accounts committee inquiry find that the government still have substantial gap in their understanding of how resilient their it estate be to cyber attack it be really helpful to hear from the minister about the work that be ongoing but in the light of this very serious incident will she and all departments urgently assess the robustness of cyber defence not only in arm length body such as the legal aid agency but in legacy it system and the supply chain which the committee find to be know area of weakness to ensure that our cyber defence in whitehall be as strong as possible my hon friend be absolutely right whether in government local authority or other body such as university and business big and small as we know some of the most famous business in this country have recently be expose to these sort of risk and whether the cyber attack come from state actor or from organised crime as appear to be the case in this instance legacy it system be one of the most serious vulnerability that be precisely what today incident highlight and it be why that national cyber strategy be go to be so important it will identify how we build up our resilience at pace and protect against these vulnerability which be system wide and affect public and private actor alike in recent month the uk have experience number of very high profile cyber attack right across the public and private sector do the minister agree that now be the time to update the computer misuse act to enhance cyber resilience through strengthen legal protection for cyber security researcher if her answer be yes which department be responsible for bring about that change the hon gentleman will know that the cyber security and resilience bill will be introduce in this session the focus of that bill be to improve the cyber defence of this country by bolster regulator support and the regulatory framework and set out how our national security agency can provide strengthened and embolden response to just such attack it seem to that that bill be the appropriate legislative vehicle for deliver what think we all wish to see which be more robust defence of our cyber system thank the minister for her statement what shock most about this attack be that it be an attack on some of the most vulnerable people in our society what can be do by resident in harlow who be concerned that their datum have be take by these criminal and how can they get legal aid if they need it thank my hon friend for that very important question people can do two thing first be in touch with their legal aid provider because that will be the source of the datum sharing and would have be the source of the application for legal aid secondly if they be concerned that their datum may have be affect they can get in touch directly with the legal aid agency legal aid provider have be inform of how those who need to apply for legal aid can continue to do so because it be vital that we do not allow the justice system to grind to halt and that those who need emergency legal aid can continue to access it we have put in place business contingency plan to ensure that no one in this country whether in harlow or anywhere else will be prevent from or delay in access legal aid while we work to resolve this issue the minister will be aware of the rise number of cyber attack by criminal and by hostile state actor may also express my disappointment that she have choose to try to make party political point on this issue instead can she say whether those responsible be uk base such as the dragonforce group or the scattered spider group who claim responsibility for the attack on the co op and marks spencer can she also say whether check be be make across government to identify any security breach that may not yet have be act on by those who be responsible will not disclose the name of the perpetrator of this malign attack do not think it would be responsible for to do so while the investigation be live and while they be be pursue not least through legal avenue be not able to share that information at the moment but when can share it will of course update the house in her zeal to have pop at the previous government the minister imply that this country be peculiarly vulnerable to cyber attack there will be people listen to she out there who may be encourage by that so will she correct the record and reflect upon the international telecommunication union global cyber security index which find britain to be right at the very top of the league table for cyber security along with country know to be expert such as estonia and germany do she agree that while we must not be complacent it be important to tell the whole truth as say those responsible be the baddie here but let be clear be absolutely shocked when come into the department to find the state of the legal aid agency legacy it system they be fragile vulnerable at risk and frankly not fit for purpose that be not my view that be the view of the law society and lot of user they have to use an arcane system that be not only slow but as we have now find be so fragile that it have expose many of its user to an unconscionable risk that be not good enough it be not talk down the system it be the state of the system that vulnerability have be expose by these malign actor the fact be that the previous government know about it and fail to fix it we will not make the same mistake thank the minister for her statement she be absolutely right join the opposition in condemn the criminal who perpetrate this attack she have already explain what constituent who may be impact should do and will not ask she to repeat that but can she assure this house that the learning from this cyber attack be already be apply across government and the public sector if extra step be require to access legal aid or process payment by legal aid provider will the provider be compensate accordingly once we have resolve this investigation once we can be assure that the hacker be no long in the system and that people data be safe and once we can be assure that our legal aid platform be operate properly and be handle people datum in safe way there will need to be stocktake and an effort to learn lesson not least as we embark we be already in the process of do this on stabilise and transform this system so that it be fit for the future no doubt there will be lesson from this particular attack for other public and government body the question of compensation must wait for another day my priority be remove the hacker from the system make sure that they feel the full force of the law and ensure that in the meantime no person who need legal aid can not get it and the system continue to operate recent cyber attack on retail target have highlight the cost to business and individual of an organisation failure to take cyber security sufficiently seriously this attack on the legal aid agency result in the theft of million of piece of deeply sensitive personal datum be perhaps the most egregious yet why have it take newspaper article to bring the minister to the chamber what else be she not tell we be afraid that the hon lady have get her chronology the wrong way round there be newspaper article because the ministry of justice have publish public statement as soon as it become aware of the full extent of the threat it do that to protect legal aid provider and their client the end user we have be utterly transparent it be not follow the newspaper article the hon lady have her fact exactly the wrong way round thank the minister for her detailed answer and reassurance the legal aid system be an imperative cog in the wheel of justice and this attack on it must be see as an attack on justice as well can the minister say whether the attack encompass legal aid detail from the entirety of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland what discussion have take place with the justice minister in northern ireland where people will have justify fear about their address be leak to those who may harm they what support be available to those who be now in fear such as domestic abuse victim my understanding be that the entirety of the legal aid agency system have be expose we do not know the full extent of that exposure and the theft that have take place and we will not know until investigation have be complete but it be for that reason that we have take the precaution of shut the system down can assure the hon gentleman that we will be in contact with all the devolved nation and region to ensure that legal aid provider throughout the united kingdom be keep inform he be right some of the most vulnerable people in society who be in receipt of legal aid will be feel that much more vulnerable today deeply regret that and it be what make so furious about what have happen urge they to be super vigilant and to be in touch with their provider and urge those provider to contact the legal aid agency and contact we about any particular vulnerability and about case in which they need to continue to provide those client with legal aid point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker you may recall that last week mr speaker grant an urgent question to my hon friend the member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman to discuss the government adherence or otherwise to paragraph of the ministerial code during the proceeding follow the urgent question assert that there be no such duty on scottish government report may vol wish to make it clear to the house that my office have since clarify the position for and that provision and of the scottish government ministerial code do confer broadly the same duty on scottish government ministers have never mislead the house before madam deputy speaker and be grateful to you for give this opportunity to correct the record thank the hon member for give notice of his point of order and for his promptness in correct the record mental health bill lords second reading relevant documents third report of the joint committee on human rights legislative scrutiny mental health bill hc report of the joint committee on the draft mental health bill of session draft mental health bill hc and the government response session cp beg to move that the bill be now read second time want to place on record my thank to baroness merron for her leadership of the bill progress in the house of lords and to thank member on both side of that house for their contribution to scrutiny of it particularly thank baroness may of maidenhead for the constructive way in which she have engage the government and for commission sir simon wessely to undertake the review of mental health that underpin so much of the bill at the general election labour stand on manifesto commitment to modernise the mental health act and be proud to say that we be deliver on that promise in the first session of this parliament in do so we be provide once in generation opportunity to profoundly transform the way in which we view and support people with serious mental illness the measure of society be how it treat its most vulnerable citizen and when it come to the treatment of people with serious mental illness we be fall well short of the humane compassionate society that we aspire to be patient live to year less than the average and they be often accommodate far away from their family and love one the facility in which they be house can be completely unsuitable during his investigation last year lord darzi find nearly patient in mental health facility who be force to share two shower and live among an infestation of rat and cockroach patient be deny the basic choice and agency that be award to nhs patient with physical illness people from ethnic minority community especially black african and caribbean man be more than three time as likely to be section although they be very different condition people with learn disability and autistic people be often lump in with those who have mental illness reflect an outdated lack of medical understanding the health secretary will have be brief by the minister for care about the tragic murder of christopher laskaris the son of my constituent fiona laskaris and the lack of voice for parent who know their own child extremely well in very difficult situation like this have the government consider whether they might table an amendment to make thing like christopher tragic murder less likely in the future be extremely grateful to the right hon gentleman for his intervention and place on record my thank to fiona for her campaigning work in circumstance that be completely unimaginable for those who have not walk in her shoe and experience the kind of grief that she be experience know that my hon friend the member for rother valley jake richards have be campaign assiduously on this issue similarly we have have representation from the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan who be in his place and the right hon gentleman we be carefully consider the argument that have be make and look at what we can do in this bill to advance thing in the way that fiona and other like she would like to see we will continue that engagement throughout the passage of the bill and see if there be workable way in which we can improve it to ensure that other do not have to go through the unimaginable heartbreak that fiona be live with every day my right hon friend be touch on way to strengthen this bill even far he will know that the joint committee on human rights have just this morning publish our report on the bill we have praise it for all that it will do to address number of inequality but we have pick out one or two area where it could go even far know that he will not yet have have chance to look at our report but will he arrange for meeting with member of the committee and the relevant minister to discuss our finding wish could correct my hon friend and say that have already read in detail the feedback from the joint committee on human rights but he be right have not yet have chance to do that however can assure he that and my hon friend the minister for care will look at the committee report we would be very happy to meet member of the committee to discuss in further detail their finding and recommendation we want to ensure that the bill be as strong as it can be give the length of time that have pass since the mental health act be reform indeed the mental health act be as old as be interruption thank you for those intervention assure member heap compliment across the chamber that it will not affect investment decision in their constituency but be none the less very grateful there be serious point here whereas attitude to mental health have come on in leap and bound in the past four decade the law have be freeze in time as result the current legislation fail to give patient adequate dignity voice and agency in their care despite the fact that patient have consistently tell we that be treat humanely and make decision about their own care play vital role in their recovery when patient be detain and treat without any say over what be happen to they it can have serious consequence for their ongoing health to quote one of the many patient who bravely share their experience with sir simon wessely independent review be sectioned be one of the most traumatic experience of my life sadly as result of be sectioned develop ptsd post traumatic stress disorder as the direct result of the way be treat sir simon review be publish seven year ago it shine light on group of people who have be hide ignore and forget in the time that have pass since the case for change have only snowball the bill now take forward sir simon recommendation the review stress that legislation alone would not fix the system culture and resource matter too this be echo in lord darzi investigation into the nhs which uncover some hard truth dramatic rise in the use of restrictive intervention on child and patient wait more than year for their first appointment with mental health service more than the entire population of leicester of whom be under the age of this bill do not solve every problem in our mental health service but it mark vital step in our plan to improve the quality of care combat long stand inequality and bring about strong focus on prevention and early intervention in mental health do my right hon friend agree that while we be see record level of mental health problem in our young people investment in community service for people with mental health problem must be priority wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend as he have hear many time from this dispatch box we want to see shift in the centre of gravity in the nhs out of hospital and into the community as one of the three key shift that will underpin our year plan for health which we will be publish in the not too distant future the mental health act be design to keep patient and the public safe but it be clear to anyone who have see how patient be treat that it do so in an outdated and blunt way that be unfit for the modern age it be too easy for someone under the act to lose all sense of agency right and respect it be sometimes necessary to detain and treat patient but there be no reason why patient experience serious mental illness should be deny the choice and agency they would rightly expect in physical care not only should the health service treat all its patient with dignity and respect anyway but give people say over their own care mean that their treatment be more likely to be successful in the foreword to his independent review sir simon wessely say often hear from those who tell look back that they realise that compulsory treatment be necessary even life save but then go on to say why do it need to be give in the way it be another patient in the review say feel lot of thing be do to rather than with we need to get this right we need to give these patient voice commend the secretary of state for bring this bill before the house on all occasion when have inquire of he he have be keen to share idea and thought on legislation in relation to northern ireland on mental ill health deprivation and poverty the figure for northern ireland be some of the high in the united kingdom which worry as the mp with responsibility for my constituent back home in strangford know he will but will the secretary of state share all the idea in the bill with mike nesbitt the health minister back home so that northern ireland can also benefit be happy to reaffirm that we have really strong working relationship with minister mike nesbitt and the northern ireland executive and we be keen to share insight wherever we can the hon gentleman make very important point which refer back to the remark make about the limitation of the legislation reform of the statute book be important in term of how the law treat people but as well as reform the model of care clinical pathway and look at new treatment innovation and technology we also need to focus on prevention attack the social determinant of ill health include mental ill health of which poverty be key driver of stress anxiety depression and bad that be why the government will keep such focus not just in our year plan for health but more broadly across public policy the current legislation have leave many people with learn disability and many autistic people in mental health hospital when they could receive much well care elsewhere around four in people with learn disability or autism could be care for in the community the bill aim to improve the care and treatment people receive when detain while keep patient and the public safe through the bill we be strengthen and clarify the criterion for detention and community treatment order to well support clinician in their decision making introduce increase scrutiny and oversight for compulsory detention and treatment and provide patient with clear road to recovery by introduce statutory care and treatment plan for all patient detain under the act except if under very short term section do the secretary of state agree that proper community treatment plan for those with learn disability and autism be not just reliant on the action of his department but cross government effort and an integrate care system at local level my hon friend be absolutely right be very glad that my department be work closely with other departments across range of issue in particular with my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pensions on the link between employment welfare and health and with my right hon friend the secretary of state for education on the reform of special educational need and disability and the interface between health and education service could go on the point be that wide range of factor have an impact on people health and wellbeing indeed people health and wellbeing can have an impact on wide range of aspect of their life which be why we have to work in mission drive cross government way thank the secretary of state for give way he be very kind be interested when he be talk about the impact of mental health on society at large whether he have give consideration to the carers trust proposal which would amend the bill so that when parent have mental health crisis check and safeguard be put in place to ensure that any young carer in that family be suitably care for be grateful to the hon member for that intervention and for raise the very serious issue an issue of increase prevalence of the impact of parental mental ill health on child and young people we be very happy to look at the carers trust proposal and to take representation on that and other issue as the bill progress through its commons stage we want to ensure that we get not just the legal basis of mental health provision in the right place but practical care as we think about child and young people mental health and wellbeing we also need to take into account their parent mental health and wellbee through that lens too patient choice and need will always be take into account thank to the introduction of new clinical checklist it require clinician to involve patient and those close to they in decision affect their care while retain the power to treat individual compulsorily where absolutely necessary do the secretary of state agree that that should be case of only when absolutely necessary in my previous role provide advocacy for the family of young man who have be in state hospital in scotland for year under compulsory treatment order his family live several hour away in north east scotland that is in my view horrendous infringement of his and their human right will he share any learning from the action the government be take which be so welcome on how community treatment can be place effectively for people who be go through such horrific restriction on their right to family life my hon friend question raise two key issue with the provision of mental health service first we must ensure that the bar be set in the right place for compulsory treatment secondly we must ensure that both compulsory and voluntary treatment in hospital setting be within reasonable distance of family friend and love one my hon friend powerfully describe the impact of such case where there be not just deprivation of liberty but an impact on an entire family we need to do much well on both side of the border when it come to the appropriate placement of people in mental health setting there will always be time when patient hit crisis point and lack the ability to express what they want to ensure that their voice be not lose and that professional be work with patient the bill introduce duty to encourage people to make an advance choice document while they be well this document provide record of their wish for use by mental health professional should the patient later experience crisis that render they incapable of make their own decision be year old when my mum first try to take her own life she be section several time over the come year and until be an adult how will this new way of treat people and make that part of the community as well as look after the child of those impact be measure over time so that we know it be successful be extremely grateful to my hon friend for share such personal live experience of the issue we be debate this afternoon encourage she to take every opportunity to share those experience directly with ministers or through the passage of this bill which other in similar situation will also have have so that we can provide the good possible support for people experience mental health crisis and for their love one who also experience an enormous amount of pain and anxiety in support someone go through acute mental illness we be also update the outdated near relative provision to allow patient to choose someone to be their nominated person which give that individual important power to represent the patient interest when they can not represent themselves one patient explain my mother use to perform this role but she now have alzheimer and she lack capacity under the current system can not specify who wish to serve as my near relative the responsibility would automatically go to my old sister sister do not get on with our reform will ensure that this statutory role be not choose for the patient but be rather the choice of the patient advocacy service be often lifeline for those who find themselves in the vulnerable position of be detain give voice to those who may otherwise feel voiceless patient have report that an advocate can ensure that their voice and opinion be value and listen to they come to my meeting value my opinion and put my view across to other people people listen to my advocate we be also extend advocacy service to patient who come to hospital voluntarily and make change to improve advocacy uptake among those who be detain as well as work to change the culture of our health and care service so that everyone be listen to and so that patient do not have to rely on an advocacy service to get their voice hear be grateful to the youthful secretary of state for give way in the past few month have have number of constituent describe the difficulty they have have in transition from care provide by child and adolescent mental health service to adult mental health service critical transition they specifically face difficulty in access the same medication when they turn that they have previously be reliant on as young people can the secretary of state describe to how either the bill or the change in culture for which he be advocate will improve the situation for people like my constituent be grateful for that intervention the hon gentleman raise what be frankly the depressingly familiar issue of the transition from youth and adolescent service to adult service which apply across such wide range of public service it be so frustrating that we be still in this decade of the century describe problem that be prevalent in the and noughtie none the less we be work to improve not just the law but the performance in this space many of the change we will be look to make under the auspex of our year plan be about well join up of datum information and patient record well care planning for patient and designing service around patient so that everyone whatever their age or stage of treatment receive join up service with clinician have full picture of that patient experience hopefully that will also help to deal with some of the cliff edge and bump in the road that people can often experience when transition from one part of the nhs to another whether that be from youth and adolescent service to adult service or the interface between primary and secondary care welcome this piece of legislation which think be generally in very good place have have tragic situation in my constituency where somebody who have be admit to hospital in suicidal state discharge themselves after which unfortunately no follow up care be provide and they take their own life it have be devastating for their family would the secretary of state consider look at how the community support people experience mental health crisis who might have discharge themselves and how we can keep they safe in future be very grateful to the hon lady for that intervention the bill deal to an extent with case that would fall under the category she describe in particular through reform to community treatment order however it would not necessarily cover the full extent of the sort of people who might find themselves in that position which be where think we can use technology which be not the answer to every problem in the health service by the way however through well use of datum patient record and analytic we will be well able in the future to predict risk and prevent tragedy as in the case the hon lady describe which be tragedy not just for those whose life be cut needlessly short but for those who live their life with that intolerable grief and loss for the many year that follow it be shameful truth about our society that people with learn disability or autism be detain sometimes for year with little or no therapeutic benefit the bill will put an end to that injustice limit detention so that people with learn disability and autistic people be no long detain beyond day unless they have co occur mental health condition that would benefit from treatment in hospital this will require the necessary community provision in place to support people with learn disability or autism and we be work to set out what strong community service look like and on the resource require to implement they so that there be robust alternative to hospital care to help to plug the flow of inappropriate admission to hospital the bill place duty on integrate care board to improve monitoring and support for people with learn disability or autism who may be at risk of future detention the bill will introduce statutory care education and treatment review to ensure that patient be safe and receive the right care and treatment when detain and that plan to discharge they to the community be be work up we will also remove prison and police cell from the definition of place of safety police cell be for criminal not patient in desperate need of medical help throughout the development of these reform we have maintain the central purpose of the mental health act to keep individual and the wide public safe the vast majority of people with mental illness include severe mental illness present no risk to themselves or other and for the majority of people treatment can be provide without compulsion however there be some people whose illness when acute can make they risk to themselves and sometimes to other no one know this well than the family of ian coates barnaby webber and grace kumar the victim of valdo calocane violent rampage in nottingham whose campaign for justice and accountability have be truly awe inspire or indeed the family of valdo calocane with whom have also spend time listen to their experience of feeling badly let down by health service as the independent investigation into the murder find both he and his victim be fail by the health service and their family have be leave to live with the consequence with level of pain the rest of we can scarcely imagine would like to place on the record my thank to all four family for meet as my team and work on the bill thank to the amendment that we be make to the mental health act decision maker will have to consider the risk of serious harm when make decision to detain that will ensure that any risk to the public and patient be consider as part of the assessment process we will also introduce new requirement for the responsible clinician to consult another person when decide whether to discharge patient put in place robust safeguard against the release of potentially dangerous people finally as have say legislation alone will not fix the wide issue of increase mental health need and long waiting time to do that the government be invest in early intervention to meet patient need and prevent they from reach crisis point will the secretary of state give way be just come to my conclusion be afraid in the past month we have meet the mental health investment standard for invest an extra million in mental health service this year which be real term increase fund mental health support team in school for almost an extra million pupil invest an extra million to build new mental health crisis centre fund nhs talk therapy for an additional patient and begin recruit the mental health professional we promise in our manifesto that be all part of the additional billion this labour government be invest in health and care service investment that be oppose by every party on the opposition benches investment that be happen only because we have labour government mental health reform be not just about change law it be about change life the action we be take will provide support and care to people at their most vulnerable modernise our mental health service to keep we all safe and create safety net that any of we might need one day commend the bill to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for bring the bill before parliament the last update to the mental health act in take eight year follow the richardson review and this bill have be similarly long time in the making so welcome the speed with which he have move on it since take office although we may tussle on occasion as have say since the election we on the conservative benches will not oppose for the sake of opposition we will be constructive work to improve legislation and support the government where we believe they be do the right thing and recognise the secretary of state constructive approach to the bill at the outset let join the secretary of state in pay tribute to the family of calocane victim in nottingham for what they have do subsequently their campaigning their dedication and their work include on this legislation and for the incredible dignity with which they have conduct themselves in unthinkable circumstance as the secretary of state mention the mental health act will not miss the opportunity to allude to his youthfulness govern the compulsory detention and medical treatment of people with severe mental illness for the safety and protection of themselves and those around they he also set out that sadly all too often those with learn disability or autism have be conflate with that group we must take this opportunity to address that and the bill rightly seek to do so in the more than year that have follow the act healthcare treatment and crucially our understanding of mental health illness have come on in enormous stride it be not only important but right that our law be update to reflect the modern world and the knowledge that we have today we be debate measure that impact those with the most severe mental health issue and their family but as be highlight in intervention on the secretary of state we should not forget the broad context the challenge pose by mental health issue more broadly or the importance of continue investment in this space we should also recognise the many organisation that do amazing work both to educate society about mental ill health and to support people with mental health illness let take this opportunity to pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt who have just leave the chamber for the work that he do on mental health as secretary of state think it be fair to say that away from the to and fro of party politic the current secretary of state share my right hon friend passion and determination to address these issue as he say we have do much but believe we can and must continue to strive to do well keep legislation up to date be particularly important for measure such as the mental health act which give the state the power to deprive people of their liberty in order to protect the safety of the individual and those around they and to carry out treatment those power should only ever be use when absolutely necessary and it be therefore right that they be review and update to ensure that they remain relevant proportionate and appropriate the most recent update to the mental health act in under the last labour government introduce community treatment order and independent mental health advocate and change the detention criterion since then as the secretary of state allude to trend have emerge that have raise concern the overall number of detention under the act have be rise steadily there be around record detention in england in include of child age and under that be increase on the previous year and around high than in in the same year black people be time more likely than white people to be detain under the act and seven time more likely to be place on community treatment order the reason for that be likely to be complex and will return to they later that be why in just year after the previous update the then prime minister theresa may now baroness may commission an independent review of how the mental health act be use and how it could be improve the review consider not only the trend in detention but wide concern about whether some process be out of step with what should exist in modern mental health system include the balance of safeguard patient choice and patient agency in their own care and the effectiveness of community treatment order sir simon wessely publish the report of his review in and take this opportunity to put on the record again our thank for his important work hear hear the previous government publish draft mental health bill base on the recommendation in the report give other the opportunity to have their say the draft bill be subject to pre legislative scrutiny by joint committee of parliament allow member of both houses to thoroughly review it and make recommendation before the final version be introduce give the importance of this area of policy which can have such profound impact on people life believe it be right that we take the time to get this right the work to update the mental health act start under the previous government and we have commitment in our election manifesto to update the law in this area and that have be carry on by the new government we continue to believe that this be the right thing to do so put on the record our in principle support for the government on the bill pay tribute to my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer for his work in this space as shadow minister not only do he have professional expertise but he have bring it to the house deliberation on this legislation suspect that we may hear from he little later there be many area of the bill that we welcome include the strengthening of the patient right to express treatment preference the expansion of access to independent mental health advocate and the removal of police and prison cell as place of safety so that patient can be treat in an appropriate setting that say of course we will not stand back without scrutinise and seek constructively to improve the bill as it pass through the house part of our role as the opposition be to engage constructively in the scrutiny of legislation to ask question to probe far to seek to prevent unintended consequence and to identify potential problem and ensure that they be air in committee in order to improve it for everyone benefit and that be what we shall do know that my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans will approach the public bill committee in that vein we very much welcome effort to improve patient voice and involvement in their own care include through great use of advance choice document in its current form the bill place duty on nhs england and integrate care board to make patient aware of their option to have such document but this could be as simple as have poster on noticeboard for instance it do not necessarily require conversation introduce it as legal right for patient who be be treat or for someone who be at risk of detention would mean that they have to be specifically tell about the option allow they to make deliberate decision suspect that in committee we may gently press the minister to go far in strengthen the patient right to have their voice hear have be on number of bill committees and gently hint to the minister area where we might press far may make his and his official live little easy when amendment be table in committee we be pleased that peer pass an amendment to well protect child who require nominated person remove the discretion where court order regard parental responsibility be in place however we believe there be more we can do to support and protect child particularly regard age appropriate setting for treatment hope that when the minister for care wind up or in committee he will explore in great detail the step the government be take to reduce the number of child be treat on adult mental health ward and to ensure that lesson be learn at both national and local service provider level thirdly we be conscious that number of element of the bill will require additional resource to be put in place the removal of police and prison cell sensibly as place of safety will require sufficient alternative capacity for people to be treat when they be detain what approach do the government intend to take in address this increase the frequency with which patient can apply to the mental health tribunal to have their detention review and widen automatic referral will potentially increase demand and pressure on the system we know that the legal system be already under pressure and the impact assessment acknowledge that there will be impact and cost so be the minister confident that the system have the capacity to handle the additional demand if not what step be be take with the ministry of justice to address that the shadow secretary of state raise an important point about resource the update impact assessment estimate that the cost of reform be billion with the secretary of state have confirm that mental health spending be fall as share of nhs expenditure from to do the shadow secretary of state agree that without legislative safeguard to protect mental health funding the bill may not achieve the aim it set out to achieve the hon gentleman be right to highlight both the cost and the investment that be need but the cost do not detract from the importance of and need for the measure set out in the legislation he point out that as proportion of overall health spending mental health spending have fall slightly in the late figure hope that the minister in his wind up will address how the government will ensure that this legislation which enjoy broad support across the house have the resource behind it to deliver the outcome we all wish to see in practice will the right hon member give way will regret do so but of course give way to the secretary of state should point out for the record that mental health spending have increase in real term this year thank to the decision the government have take as proportion of spend on health service overall it be true to say that it have decrease by but that do not take into account the fact that as well as invest heavily in our elective backlog and in clear waiting list we be invest in general practice which will benefit enormously people with mental ill health the secretary of state be kind than he normally be and be grateful to he for acknowledge the reduction in the proportion of mental health spending it be slight but it be none the less reduction hear what he say more broadly but hope that he and the minister will reiterate their commitment to ensure that the legislation succeed which we all wish for and that the pressure it may place on part of the system will be address and not simply be absorb within the system suspect that the minister will come to that in his concluding remark while it be the right principle to direct more mental health patient away from in patient hospital setting and to community treatment setting where clinically appropriate this be key and go to the secretary of state point we must ensure that the nhs have the capacity to provide community treatment when the bill be on the statute book the government accept that the reform will take number of year to implement give the need to recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff but what be the plan and how much will it cost will it be phase in over number of year the nhs workforce plan will nearly double the number of mental health nurse by but the secretary of state have say that he intend to update the plan it would be helpful if during the bill passage he or the minister could tell either the bill committee or this chamber what the change that he envisage make through this legislation will mean for the workforce we recognise the significance of the provision limit the detention of patient with learn disability or autism under the bill they can be detain for treatment only if they have co occur mental health condition that require hospital treatment and meet the criterion in the mental health act autism alone would no long justify continued detention under the act in theory this will ensure that those with autism receive the appropriate support in the right setting as we would all wish what step be be take to ensure that there be sufficient service with sufficient capacity to properly support people with autism and learning disability can he confirm that under this legislation there will always be central role for professional clinical judgment on these matter this debate in part follow on from concern be raise about racial disparity in the application of the mental health act can the secretary of state or the minister provide more evidence to help the house well understand this issue what research have be undertake or be be plan to enable we to understand what be behind the statistic we welcome this important opportunity to look again at how we treat and protect people with the most severe mental illness and to ensure that our law remain relevant and proportionate in the modern world empower people and treat they humanely update the mental health act be the right thing to do and we will work constructively with the government to improve the safety treatment agency and crucially dignity of mental health patient who be detain and of the wide public add my thank to the secretary of state and his whole ministerial team for bring forward this crucial legislation so early in this government alongside other positive measure to fix our nhs it be labour that build the nhs and save it in and here he be with his team fix our crucial nhs serve community in bermondsey and old southwark with high prevalence of mental health condition and psychosis we be fortunate to have south london and maudsley nhs foundation trust on our doorstep this legislation will be crucial for the service professional work on the frontline as well as all those who need support my borough of southwark have additional help fund by southwark labour council and our integrate care board include direct access to help through online system and drop in hub for young people means of support that allow they to avoid gp wait time and delay in access help be glad that this legislation adopt similar principle of ensure early access to help but despite the additional support in southwark as the local mp see the impact that poor mental health have on people life which be blight by ill health and discrimination be acutely aware that just of people with schizophrenia be in employment for example this bill offer chance to tackle some of the issue but it be overdue look forward to work with local organisation and people with direct experience include trade union in mental health service carer blackfriars settlement food bank and the drop in club that support people with mental health condition throughout southwark which be do fantastic work often on shoe string budget as the constituency mp also see the impact on whole neighbourhood if someone ill health cause they to behave erratically and sometimes antisocially noise and drug be often interrelate issue there can also be police involvement follow cuckoo by criminal who take advantage of vulnerable people hope that the bill will challenge that grow phenomenon it would be good to hear from the minister whether community include landlord and neighbour where appropriate can trigger intervention to support people in crisis just two week ago join ride along with the police response team some might say that it be not the first time have help the police with their inquiry on that ride along which be my third with the local police see again the consistent and sad overlap between what they be deal with and mental health crisis end my shift with those police officer at king college hospital try to seek support for one ill man hope that the government will retain the extension of section and power deliver in lords amendment that would ensure that there be train and qualified support which would reduce the time that police lose the amendment would save thousand of hour week of officer time in london alone and police could be redirect to area where they be more need go back far in the run up to the introduction of the mental capacity act be work at the disability rights commission and recall that mental health organisation be almost envious of that legislation give the need to reform the mental health act they wonder when access to advocacy and patient centre treatment would be deliver for people with mental health condition it be sad that there have be miss decade in between but be glad that this bill be before we today the advance choice document be step towards return to the great choice and control lose in recent year as service decline under the last government the use of nominated person as outline by the secretary of state also offer great step forward as do access to extended use of independent mental health advocate for those in hospital that should be automatic as mind have advocate it be great that the legislation be base on the wessely independent review and the principle underpin it on more personal level and go back even far the reason become more aware of politic be my mum diagnosis of schizophrenia in the early at roughly the time when the secretary of state be bear then rethink be still call the national schizophrenia fellowship mum have be through the mill in the decade in between will not suggest that she have be detain more time than have have hot dinner hon member can see by my waistline that that be not true but the fact that the mental health act have not be update since then be appal when join the labour party in the early never dream that could play part in improve legislation as an mp want to flag couple of concern base on family experience recently mum tell we that she believe she work at bank that be news to we in the family no doubt it be news to the bank as she be and have not have to work for some time can laugh about it but it be upsetting that she be unwell it be frustrating that the system be mad and try to access support for she be madden for we as family her gp deny that she be unwell and refuse to see she the last time this happen she be sectioned for six week until she be back in rude health and believe she be very rude when she come out south london and maudsley nhs foundation trust estimate that it cost week to keep someone in hospital until they recover nhs england have put figure of on detain someone with schizophrenia until they be well those cost be avoidable if gps act fast will the bill result in well trigger point this be not about artificial intelligence it be about use known datum in the system so that there be access to supportive intervention that help individual who have mental health condition help their family avoid the pain and suffering that they share when an individual be unwell save community the misery of associate antisocial behaviour or other problem potentially save the police fortune as result of their no long have to accompany people to hospital for treatment where that can be avoid and of course save the nhs thousand in avoidable hospitalisation and in patient treatment gps can be part of the solution but too often they pass the buck and avoid the issue as the gardenia surgery in luton do pretend that everything be okay despite prescription be uncollected which lead to the inevitability of mental ill health rise fast hope that the bill will lead to well community care as the secretary of state have outline but also hope that gps and pharmacist will be support in trigger outreach work from mental health trust when someone do not collect their repeat prescription for example hope that it will be confirm clearly that this will be in the legislation or that the government will indicate willingness to accept an amendment along those line my final link point be that the bill should come with government target for reduce readmission and section if the bill be successful people will not be discharge and readmitte in quick succession and patient know to the system will not require routine cyclical readmission with the right support the dysfunctional system can be replace that will have huge benefit for people mental health and will mean huge saving for the nhs there be think detention last year hope that the government will set out how that figure will fall really look forward to support the bill progression the bill will be transformative for the people serve in my community and the people love in my family it will be transformative for million of people across the country people with mental health condition their family carer and service professional and if it be do right it will save the nhs fortune too call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for introduce this really important bill and the minister for his proactive engagement with we early this week before enter parliament be trustee of the veterinary mental health charity vetlife which care for the mental health of the veterinary profession have have to clarify before that it be not mental health charity for animal with mental health issue become trustee of the charity because my really close friend sarah at the age of just when she have her whole life and career ahead of she take her own life take her place as trustee get the news that have lose she be one of the most painful experience of my life many hon member in the chamber will have suffer similar experience with their friend and love one speak about sarah because while we be in this place we rightly often discuss mental health issue use statistic we talk about waiting time workforce shortage and the economic impact but we must never forget that there be individual life behind the number and nearly every person in the country be affect in some way that might be through their own struggle or those of love one or through grief after someone they care about have lose their battle with depression to return briefly to statistic veterinary medicine the profession come from have suicide rate four time the national average it be small profession where everyone know everyone and everyone have lose friend or colleague to suicide share that not just for awareness but because it remind we that certain group be at much high risk they be more vulnerable than other and we should do much more to identify and support they my hon friend as veterinarian will know that farmer also suffer with significant mental health issue my constituent be under immense pressure follow the family farm tax and the sudden closure of the sustainable farming incentive alongside that they work extremely long hour and the unpredictability of farm work mean that it be more difficult for they to access mental health support and doctor appointment do he agree that we should introduce regular mental health mot check at key point in people life when they be most vulnerable to mental ill health particularly for those in rural area where there be barrier to access support my hon friend will not be surprised that agree with she she may as well have read the next bit of my speech she be completely right farmer those work in agriculture military veteran and their family mother in the first year after childbirth people live in poverty and the community be just few of the group that we know be at heighten risk we already take proactive approach when it come to physical health we have target cancer screening for at risk demographic we should take the same approach to mental health that be why the liberal democrats have long call for properly resource community mental health hub which could reach people before they reach crisis point we be also call as my hon friend just do for regular mental health check up at key life stage for example when someone have just give birth or just be discharge from the army my hon friend be outline the treatment option for patient new medicine be also incredibly important and groundbreake research be happen at the warneford hospital in oxfordshire mental health hospital that be in desperate need of investment treatment option and new medicine go hand in hand so do he agree that the government should get behind the warneford and invest in it agree with my hon friend and thank he for his intervention mental health mot could help to catch at risk people early so that we can start treat they before the problem develop far be sure that for all member present mental health issue be among the top area in our email inboxe and our correspondence we receive email from desperate parent of young people who be leave on waiting list for year throughout their schooling and from adult fall between the crack of an overstretched system we should probably acknowledge that these be not anomaly they be the symptom of system that be under immense strain this long await mental health bill be very welcome step but it can not be the only step because at the heart of our approach must be the simple principle that prevention be well than cure absolutely support the idea that we need to invest in prevention be behind that but have also speak to many constituent who have issue with emergency health care one of my constituent ed sadly take his own life he go into undergo psychotic episode and be leave simply with phone number and no assessment hour later he be lose we need to ensure that those who need emergency treatment get it on the spot as well as invest in prevention do my hon friend agree with that principle totally agree and will come on to the care of people once they have be discharge after an acute mental health episode because it be hugely emotive and problematic situation we need comprehensive mental health strategy that see mental health not just as clinical issue but as the secretary of state say something that need to run through housing education employment and justice good clinical service be vital but we can not medicate or refer our way out of mental health crisis many mental health issue be often root in deep challenge include poverty housing insecurity loneliness debt and trauma these be not medical problem but they put people at huge risk of develop mental health issue and if we be serious about prevention we must tackle these root cause head on the bill focus very much on the right and treatment of people once they be admit to mental health unit which be essential but what be just as important as my hon friend the member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins have just highlight be what happen when they be discharge and what support they get in the community to prevent relapse in winchester we have see brilliant initiative between local nhs mental health team and citizens advice team from citizens advice be in mental health unit call melbury lodge and they help mental health patient with all their life admin the bill the correspondence so that they be not discharge back into the community only to come home to load of outstanding credit card bill and demand to repay their personal independence payment for example what be remarkable be that every pound spend on that initiative save in cost avoidance for the nhs through short in patient stay few readmission well engagement of service once they be discharge and reduction in medication use this be win win for staff patient and the taxpayer but it be pilot project and there be no funding secure for it to continue despite the prove cost save benefit we urge the government to look seriously at roll out such initiative nationwide my hon friend the member for dorking and horley chris coghlan have be passionately campaign since enter this house to ensure that family have great input into medical decision when there be question over the mental capacity of vulnerable patient and invite he to make an intervention now thank my hon friend as he know in my maiden speech eight month ago pledge that fiona laskaris would succeed in change the law that have prevent she from save her autistic son christopher from murder fiona be here today despite plead for year she be never able to obtain mental capacity assessment for her son as we hear from the secretary of state the government be now seriously look at an amendment that would both honour christopher legacy and save life do my hon friend support that amendment thank my hon friend for that moving intervention and offer my condolence to those in the gallery we appreciate that the secretary of state be seriously consider an amendment that might help save life early intervention can not just be slogan it have to be the foundation of functional system last week sit around campfire with the amazing team at the winchester youth counselling service that charity have nature therapy programme in which to year old can go camping have walk and talk therapy and do bushcraft and outdoor cooking while we be toast our marshmallow the team be talk about the free confidential mental health support that they offer provide service such as one to one counselling and weekly wellbee walk in session by immerse young people in nature this programme help to reduce stress and anxiety and foster emotional wellbeing and resilience crucially the service be accessible without the need for doctor referral or diagnosis young people can self refer ensure that support be available promptly when it be need most this be why liberal democrats have be call for mental health hub for young people in every community we support the government campaign for mental health professional in every primary and secondary school not just an occasional visit or pilot scheme but permanent fund presence just to follow up on my hon friend point about the importance of mental health hub in west dorset the only child and adolescent mental health service centre be in dorchester and for many people in my constituency especially young people that mean at least mile round trip to access service in rural britain we be lucky if transport link exist and those that do be often limited that make access service nearly impossible which be what make hub so important totally recognise the importance of that intervention we also need system that be much easy to navigate psychiatrist come to see in my office in winchester and tell that his son have be refer to camhs he say that despite the fact that he and his wife work in the medical profession they have really struggle to access the help that they need he say if we can navigate the system what chance do anyone else have that be one reason that liberal democrats be call for mental health commissioner someone to champion family cut through bureaucracy and help people to get the support they need before thing get bad the system need to be simplify both for the parent and family who be try to access the service and to allow the system itself to function for year liberal democrats have campaign for mental health to be treat equally with physical health and we welcome the commitment to parity in the king speech but it must be back by action the darzi report show that mental health account for around of the nhs case burden as the secretary of state acknowledge yet it receive just under of the funding for this reason we want to ensure that the mental health investment standard be maintain and strengthen and not quietly scrap or water down the secretary of state also highlight the scale of this challenge around million people be on waiting list for mental health service but importantly child be on mental health waiting list and some of they be wait an average of month for care which be huge chunk of their educational time and personal development this be not crisis that be wait to happen it be crisis that be already here in this economic crisis some people ask how can we afford to invest in mental health but the real question be how can we afford not to do so because we already pay the price in lose productivity emergency call out admission and most tragically of all life cut short we must spend to save the hon member for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle speak about spend time with police have do the same thing fascinating and informative exercise encourage everyone to go on patrol with their police in winchester the police say they spend up to of their time respond to mental health relate incident we know that patient turn up to in mental health crisis many already on mental health waiting list hear that the average amount of time someone spend in mental health crisis in winchester often need individual supervision be hour that be not sustainable because we be use the most expensive part of our health system to do the work that should be happen early which would be more cost effective for the taxpayer and provide well outcome for patient finally pay tribute to all those on the frontline the nurse counsellor psychiatrist doctor therapist support staff and charity who prop up system that should be support they we very much look forward to work constructively with the government to improve the bill and we support it we will keep push until we live in country where mental health get the same attention and care as physical health one of the reason stand for parliament be to work hard to create society that value disabled people that treat we with dignity and respect and that ensure there be nothing about we without we it be right that this government will fix the broken system to ensure that we give mental health the same attention as physical health be pleased to see the four key principle from the independent review of the mental health act at the heart of the bill choice and autonomy least restriction the principle of therapeutic benefit and most importantly treat people as individual after year of conservative government over autistic people and people with learn disability be in mental health hospital in england some of those people be detain under the mental health act and the average length of stay for in patient be almost five year this be human right scandal as the joint committee on human rights conclude in the current situation be simply wrong autism and learning disability be not mental health condition and yet under the current mental health act autistic people and people with learn disability can be detain in mental health hospital indefinitely in my year career work with autistic people and those with learn disability along with autism organisation up and down the country include the national autistic society and the autism alliance have see the tragedy of autistic people cycle through the mental health system because of those measure and the failure of public service to provide adequate social care on discharge from hospital order as an mp know from my constituency that too many people be still be detain who could be support to live well in our community by organisation such as greave house farm trust and action for autism barnsley which be on my doorstep the most significant change in the bill be the removal of autism and learning disability from the definition of mental disorder under section of the exist act this vital change mean that autistic people and people with learn disability can not be detain for treatment unless they have co occur mental health condition that require in patient mental health care the government have say that the propose change to the detention criterion for people with learn disability and autistic people will only be switch on when system be able to demonstrate sufficient level of community support it be crucial for that to happen quickly through the government work closely with autistic people and those with learn disability as well with as advocacy group to publish plan to build sufficient support in our community up and down the country my book on the treatment of autistic people in the criminal justice system demonstrate that ensure that there be an appropriate level of service in the community be essential in prevent the need of autistic people and people with learn disability from become too complex lead to admission to mental health hospital it also demonstrate the need to support safe discharge out of hospital critical to reduce the number of those currently detain in hospital under the current law be care education and treatment review for adult and child who be autistic or have learn disability which will help speed up discharge prevent admission and ensure that the person be be give appropriate care be delighted that the bill will make those review statutory in in patient setting the responsible commissioner clinician integrate care board and local authority must have regard to the recommendation arise from they as chair of the all party parliamentary group on autism be aware that recommendation be often not follow in an expeditious manner therefore there be an opportunity to strengthen the duty on responsible party to follow recommendation from those review the health secretary have be move mountain to work on our year plan therefore hope that the bill year implementation period for the change to detention criterion will align with his important work he be also do an incredible job to move to prevention lead health system and that provide an opportunity for an integrated approach to community support include work with the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure there be adequate housing in every integrate care system the exclusion and marginalisation of autistic people and those with learn disability through their institutionalisation in hospital perpetuate their exclusion from our society be proud that our government be tackle these issue so early on in this parliament alongside their commitment to the mental health investment standard the recruitment of mental health worker and work to deliver long term plan for the reform of adult social care society be an order of equality and non discrimination it be all the rich where autistic people and people with learning disability be include within it to fulfil their potential commend this bill to the house rise to speak in support of the bill to begin with need to make couple of declaration have family member who be consultant psychiatrist be now non practise general adult psychiatrist with an endorsement and year in psychiatry and previously work as consultant psychiatrist take part in the wessely review as panel member on the tribunal working group and be on the pre legislative scrutiny committee in the last parliament in declaration of more personal nature this be an area that feel passionately about it be great privilege to speak to this important piece of legislation and reform go forward the united kingdom reform its mental health legislation every year or so do not want to correct the secretary of state but the first mental health act be in hope that be substantially before he be bear with reference to his early comment the legislation have go through various iteration from the original lunacy act and similar legislation in the century in the uk we have always be at the forefront of reform to the law and to provision and power in this area it be important in this second reading debate to focus on what the mental health act be and what it do member have talk more broadly about the challenge of deliver mental health care currently but it be important to reflect that the mental health act be very specific and precise it be about the regulation of detention sometimes for assessment sometimes for treatment of people with mental disorder and have range of power on aftercare and guardianship it be focus on detention and assessment or treatment of people with mental disorder we need that because there be time when people with severe mental illness become so unwell that they be unable to recognise their illness their illness put their health at risk predominantly through self neglect or non treatment it put their safety at risk again through self neglect as well as through suicide and less commonly but critically it put they at risk of cause harm to other the legal framework allow we to regulate compulsory treatment in that regard it be absolutely critical that we have those power so that when people be so unwell that they do not recognise it and they lose agency we can as compassionate society take they into hospital and treat they with view to get they back to themselves have use the act countless time apply it both to assessment and as section approve doctor to treatment and have use it as responsible clinician suspect that be one of the few member of this house certainly in this debate who have have those role and responsibility in term of frame it be important to reflect that one of the key change in the act which be such an important piece of legislation be that it be about restrict power and ensure that there be strong procedure for review detention as former health professional in this area be certain that all professional work in it be mindful of the scope of power that the act provide when apply restriction people do not use these power in anger or without great degree of thought and contemplation the most intrusive intervention available to we in the health service be to detain and treat people in hospital or in secure hospital setting those power be not take lightly lot of concern be express at the start of the debate and be sure it will continue about the way in which people have be treat in hospital there have be some very high profile scandal in which thing have not work well to say the least and care and treatment have be atrocious and abusive however people work in health and care in the uk be do so because they want to see the good outcome for their patient sometimes they be limit in that because of the resource available they do not use the mental health act with view to harm people but with view to help they be detain under the mental health act be not prime facie harm it be treatment and good thing if someone need to be detain and treat in hospital they need to be detain and treat in hospital if become so unwell that need to be detain under the act would want to be detain thankfully be not in that position at least believe that be not although the shadow minister my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans might have different view on that laughter should get to the point where be so unwell that can not consider my own care would want the power of the mental health act to be use quickly particularly if be pose risk to myself my family and other so that can get well and back to live my life pay tribute to baroness may of maidenhead who kick this off and to professor sir simon wessely good friend stephen gilbert sir mark hedley and rabbi baroness neuberger for their work in the review there be lot of good work in the bill from the great focus on advance care planning and the more frequent detention review which recognise may bring workforce burden to the provision on nominate person will not go into the detail in this second read speech but will focus on few general point on which think bit more work need to be undertake in some way will have to message sir simon after this to ask his forgiveness the bill be miss opportunity in that we have be not move towards fusion law for the benefit of those who be not all over the detail at the moment the uk have two piece of legislation regulate how to treat people in the absence of consent the mental capacity act come about from case law in the and and be codify in that act broadly regulate physical health treatment for people who lack the capacity to consent we have focus quite lot on capacity in the recent debate on the terminally ill adult end of life bill the principle of the act be autonomy and the functional capacity and good interest test for people who lack capacity mean that we test someone capacity and only if they lack capacity can we intervene in their good interest sometimes by use deprivation of liberty the mental health act arise from very different pathway in its first day it be more about the regulation of asylum the act be about status and risk the gatekeeper condition for the current mental health act be that patient have mental disorder of nature and degree that require assessment in hospital because of the risk to their health and to the safety of other capacity do not feature whatsoever we have two piece of legislation one apply to the most severe mental disorder and deal with status and risk and the other deal with autonomy and good interest strongly believe that the two need to be merge we should use capacity and good interest framework to regulate treatment of mental disorder in the absence of consent there be way of do that like the fact that we be start to incorporate bit more in the bill do the hon member not think that the deprivation of liberty safeguard which unlike the mental health act help to hold those who lack capacity in an environment that be not secure or lock such as hospital be useful and that bring the two provision together be unnecessary the hon member be of course very knowledgeable give his background as mental health nurse would like to see in the bill provision set out that in order to detain someone for the purpose of health or safety they must lack decision make capacity for the detention to be authorise for the prevention of harm to other there be reason to overcome autonomy in decision make capacity but would like to see an additional component specify that if the detention for assessment and treatment in hospital be purely base on health and safety and not on risk of harm to other the patient must also lack capacity otherwise people who have full and intact decision make capacity can nevertheless come into the scope of the power the liberty protection safeguard be bit of mess quite frankly and the dols be clearly substantial mess it be interesting that the legislative scrutiny of the bill point out that it be miss opportunity not to tidy up some of the interface between the mental health act and the mental capacity act point that will come to little later in my speech in term of parity of esteem bring forward fusion law and gel the act close together need to be the direction of travel hope that we do not have to waste another year until we get the opportunity something like that there be something else that we need to reflect on it come to my other point about the focus in the bill but will reiterate it the core focus of the bill be on reduce detention of people from black and minority ethnic group who be over represent in detention one of the key focus in fix that must be on socioeconomic deprivation where we see socioeconomic deprivation we see severe mental disorder follow but worry that the bill be miss opportunity and will not do what be require to deal with those disparity there be three problem with the bill and two thing that wish to flag be sensitive to the concern that have be raise about people with autistic spectrum disorder and learn disability and the advocacy regard such people be in hospital be in general adult ward be challenging environment as it be and it be particularly challenge for someone with an asd or learn disability people can get stick in hospital not really go anywhere that concern apply to most disorder do not think it be unique give the lack of community support service disagree however with the focus on asd and ld above all other condition if we want to talk about non progressive condition do not understand why brain injury or korsakoff dementia for example be not within the scope of this measure do not understand why rather than use the bill to take people out of section of the mental health act something like bolster treatability test be not use which be what be in the act before it be modify in be grateful to the hon gentleman who have bring his wealth of experience to this place would he concede that the focus on learn disability and autism be perhaps because those disorder have very specific feature be in an unfamiliar over sensory stimulating or noisy environment with break from routine have an adverse effect on some people precisely because of the nature of their disability and perhaps more so than for some of the other condition he have mention indeed it seem something of weird anomaly that learn disability and autism be class as mental illness for the sake of the mental health act be sure the hon gentleman will agree they very much be not thank the hon lady for her intervention sensory over stimulation can be particular issue for those with autistic spectrum disorder have be concern when have look after patient and have think carefully about the challenge particularly in general adult ward of cater to the need of people with autistic spectrum disorder or learn disability would argue that that would apply broadly to anyone in general adult hospital irrespective of diagnosis everyone have particular need and sensitivity and we need to be mindful of that suspect this be something that the hon lady and will disagree on but would consider an autistic spectrum disorder and learn disability to be mental disorder it certainly be under the classification of mental and behavioural disorder one problem with how this issue be frame in the bill be for example where rett disorder which be also pervasive developmental disorder would come into it do it come under the term autistic where do not otherwise specify pervasive developmental disorder come into it be not sure whether how the term in the bill will operate in real life have be think through do not understand why we be not push for such provision for every disorder and condition that people have when they come into hospital that be why we be not focus on something like treatability test or otherwise this have specific real life fall out if people need to be in hospital after day and there be deprivation of liberty that be go to happen it will not stop happen with the good will in the world and even with this bill it will keep on happen people will either be detain under liberty protection safeguard or they will end up be detain with anxiety relate to their asd or learn disability which would place they within scope of the mental health act further challenge and disparity in the bill be that it do not affect forensic provision people could be keener to pursue criminal prosecution of people with asd or an ld because that would enable long stay in detention than day that be why in the pre legislative scrutiny we suggest that there should be an option to get pre authorisation for detention beyond day by go to tribunal which we think might deal with some of the concern raise personally like the idea of pre authorisation in general beyond day and it be something that professor richardson speak about in her review back in the late the government recognise that there be challenge with this area which be why these change be in the schedule there be recognition that frankly this be not workable and we will see as the bill progress that there be broad concern about how it operate another area of concern be nominate person and parental responsibility the bill change near relative to nominated person which mean that people can choose who perform that important role under the act the near relative or nominated person can discharge someone from the power of the act which would inevitably mean that they would be discharge from hospital there be power to bar people but it be quite high threshold this measure be important because it will allow someone under the age of to choose someone who be not their parent to have that important statutory power we raise this issue in the pre legislative scrutiny committee we could have situation in which year old with competence who be detain under the act in hospital choose their mate or somebody else not their parent or someone with parental responsibility to have the power to discharge they from measure under the act which would inevitably mean they leave hospital the parent who in such situation be often responsible in some way for the after care would lose that power be concern as be the lords about the impact of that measure on the children act think there be serious problem in change this area of law we do not have this in physical health and introduce the ability to give statutory power to non parent know the minister will look into that in the bill committee but think the government will have to row back on that they could easily amend the bill to say that if someone be under the age of the nominated person must have parental responsibility unless there be good reason for they not to have it sixteen and year old be bit different especially when people start get close to and there be other child right but can not see why we should legislate to let someone under choose someone who do not have parental responsibility to have that important power the third problem be that the bill be silent on deprivation of liberty in which be ongoing it have be while since work in but there have always be the challenge of what to do with someone who turn up to if the doctor think that they will probably need detain under the mental health act because they be suicidal or very unwell and want to keep they there while the assessment take place we can get through it use the mental capacity act but it be messy it would be lot clear for everybody if we say for example that section of the act which allow for temporary detention could apply to an setting there be bunch of technical stuff about the interaction between deprivation of liberty and the mental capacity act but suspect you will start give the evil eye madam deputy speaker and tell to move on if madam deputy speaker say no but suspect that member across the house might start do that so will move on let flag two thing in the bill it allow for discharge from hospital under supervise conditional discharge to deprivation of liberty that be in response to the case of secretary of state for justice mm which involve problem with how the law currently operate as far as know in mental health law we have never have situation where deprivation of liberty in the community be authorise under the mental health act someone have to be in registered hospital that be big rubicon to cross see why the government need to tidy up this area of law but be not convince that we have realise what big rubicon this be to cross the operation of the mental health act have always mean that someone be detain in hospital but when they be in the community they be in the community someone might have certain restriction place on they by community treatment order or otherwise but they be not deprive of their liberty in their home or in some other community set that be not register medical hospital think that measure need bit more reflection believe that the majority of those who will undergo compulsory treatment under detention certainly for long period of time under this legislation will be people with psychosis such as schizophrenic form of psychosis schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder but lot of the debate and focus have be on non psychotic illness that be not to say that those illness be less important they be certainly not less important especially for those who experience they but be concerned that people with schizophrenia always get raw deal they be often marginalise by society and in term of the amount of advocacy they have in fact lot of the evidence that we review in the pre legislative scrutiny committee focus on non psychotic disorder perhaps because sadly people often turn their back on people with psychotic illness sometimes those people find themselves in situation where their illness be so debilitate that they can not advocate for themselves so there tend to be bias towards disorder such as dementia asd and ld where there be someone to advocate such as camhs or family who might push little bit more be not say that any condition be more important really want to stress that but as parliamentarian we do not necessarily understand that the bulk of the condition that the bill focus on concern psychosis finally have speak lot about how psychosis can lead to people be detain in hospital and about the impact of that psychosis be pretty terrible disease but it do not need to be lot of people get well and it be one of the most treatable disease the bill will help people to get well and we can not lose sight of that welcome today second reading of the bill would like to focus on one aspect of the legislation the removal of autism and learning disability from the definition of mental disorder under section of the mental health act recently visit wonderful local charity the challenging behaviour foundation it be the only uk charity specifically focus on the need of child young people and adult with severe learning disability whose behaviour may be describe as challenging and their family on that visit be shocked to learn that under the mental health act autistic people and people with learn disability can be detain in mental health hospital indefinitely just because they be autistic or have learn disability thank the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer for share his extensive professional experience but disagree with he on one point in my view autism and learning disability be not mental health condition and do not believe that they should be treat as such in law which be view share by lot of people in the sector who have speak to in advance of the debate this issue be currently affect lot of people as my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball say over autistic people and people with learn disability be in mental health hospital in england today the vast majority of whom be there under the mental health act importantly around of they be under the age of so this be affect lot of our young people mental health hospital be often inappropriate for autistic people and people with learn disability once detain they can get stick in those setting for many year which can be deeply overwhelming and damaging and lead to lifelong trauma as my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge mention the average length of stay for current in patient be nearly five year and we have to ask ourselves why that be the late available data show that the key reason for delay discharge be lack of suitable housing and lack of social care charity like cbf continue to hear worrying story of abuse over medication unnecessary restraint and seclusion in these setting back in panorama uncover abuse at winterbourne view hospital bring attention to the fact that many people with learn disability and autistic people be be detain in hospital when they could and should be live in the community since then there have be numerous policy intervention and action plan from the previous government however sadly they have not result in the change promise and all national target to reduce in patient number have be miss in fact the number have increase legislative change be clearly need and welcome the change to detention criterion in the bill that will mean that autistic people and people with learn disability can not be detain for treatment unless they have co occur mental health condition that require in patient mental health care however on page of the impact assessment the government say that the propose change will only be switch on when system be able to demonstrate sufficient level of community support ensure appropriate provision of service in the community be crucial to support autistic people and those with learn disability so that they can be discharge from hospital and so that we can prevent need from escalate and prevent admission to mental health hospital however if there be no comprehensive fully resource plan to build capacity in the community and enable this change to be switch on this vital reform could be delay for far too long urge the government to publish comprehensive plan to ensure that the change to detention criterion can be commence and to ensure accountability for this process ideally commencement would be in in line with modelling in the impact assessment also ask that those change be co produce with the people who will be affect by they the previous government build the right support service model could act as the starting point but draw the minister attention to the challenge behaviour national strategy group co ordinated by cbf which have develop co produce lifelong action plan that set out not only the change that need to be make to get community support right but resource and good practice encourage the minister to meet family to well understand the impact of inappropriate detention on people with learn disability or autism and their family would be happy to help co ordinate that through cbf eight month ago in my maiden speech to parliament say that fiona laskaris would succeed in change the law that prevent she from save her autistic son christopher from murder be here today to honour that commitment we be on the cusp of change the law we have get this far thank to the national autistic society mps from across the chamber work together to overcome injustice include the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt the hon member for rother valley jake richards the right hon member for leeds south hilary benn and my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey steadfast support from my party the liberal democrats and support from the prime minister and the government in way that represent parliament at its good and elisa menendez and romilly weeks from itv who run the story above all we get this far because of the courage and determination of fiona laskaris to save other from the fate that befell her son christopher fiona and cara christopher sister be in the gallery christopher be not unlike many autistic child he be sensitive intelligent loving and compassionate boy who once ask his mum to stop on the way to school to rescue lamb that be stick in fence first meet fiona when be eight stay in my bedroom and ignore she perhaps because be angry that she be buy my home off my dad my mum have die when be few month old and be sensitive boy well they move in christopher grow up in my old bedroom and he love the house as much as do but as young man live alone in leeds he struggle despite fiona plead for help for year she be never able to attain for he the mental capacity assessment that he need to determine his support requirement horrifically he be exploit and murder by man who have just be release from jail christopher be we be work with the government on an amendment to the bill to ensure that the view of family member be consider when determine an adult requirement for mental capacity assessment christopher story be not unique king college london find that in alone there be preventable death of people with autism and learn disability in case in which the mental capacity act have not be correctly follow it can be hard to grasp the scale of the special educational need and disability crisis in this country but ten of thousand of send child be out of school include in surrey alone we be lose autistic child include my constituent jennifer chalkley to avoidable suicide and at worst we be abandon autistic people in their to murderer we be fail generation how we answer their call for justice will serve as measure of who we be and believe the answer be less matter of money than of leadership we know from nobel laureate james heckman that early intervention be exponentially more effective and economical in today brutalise system which have cost the life of christopher jennifer and too many other although this amendment be only small part of the answer it can save life if one grieve mother can change the law perhaps we can change the other thing too if we succeed it will be above all because of the voice of broken but unbeaten parent like fiona demand change although christopher have difficult life he have the most precious thing that any man can have love and devoted mum it be up to we to ensure that fiona be witness that in our country it be possible for the vulnerable to be hear for injustice to be overcome and to find beyond grief hope that be very moving speech commend the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan on powerful and vital contribution to this debate in fact commend everyone who have speak so far often from personal experience and expertise this be unfinished business and this bill be long overdue have be reflect on my first placement as pre registration student nurse go straight into mental health ward be not mental health nurse that be not the route take but not because anything see there particularly turn off it however it be remarkable experience when walk into the unit for the first time be show burn pool table it have be burn down the day before the staff apologise and we move on the staff be full of compassion but also frustration and one of the thing that they be frustrate with be the mental health act this be some time ago we be talk about in one of my very first teach session on that unit be tell about all the thing that need to be change in the act so it be slightly surprising that have wind up in this place with the opportunity to change and challenge those element the point make to then be particularly about the challenge for different community and the way that people from different ethnicity and culture be assess for mental ill health the bill will help to adjust that and hopefully we can mitigate those problem and move beyond and progress from the act some thing be not even properly on people radar then for example there be less understanding of neurodiversity autism and learning disability and the inappropriate way that they be cover by the act many member have talk about the large number of people who be autistic or have learn disability who be incarcerate that have be describe as an offence against human right and believe that to be true but also believe that it will be challenge to overcome in the long term plan for the nhs be bring forward by baroness may and several member of this house have key part in drive forward that change it say that we should challenge the detention of people who be autistic in mental health location that people be leave in for very long time we hear from my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball that the average length of stay of someone who be autistic or have learn disability and be detain under the act be year that be lot long than many people with psychotic illness would need to be detain that long term plan for the nhs have great intention and make suggestion for overcome the issue and liberate people from detention it be not just the pandemic that come soon afterwards that kibosh they it be really hard to drive change in the system when the mental health act protect clinician and senior people in the nhs in not drive forward that change that be need to drive it forward we need change to the act and that be what we have in front of we commend everyone who have work hard on the bill to ensure that patient voice be hear in my constituency of sittingbourne and sheppey we have big mental health challenge we have the high suicide rate in kent and think the high suicide rate of any local authority area in the country that mean that other member in this house have even big challenge when it come to suicide and mental health provision be sure that what many of those place and member have in common be the challenge of economic deprivation and inequality which let we face it be the big driver of poor mental health outcome that be mention admirably by the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer who talk at length about the complexity of the act commend he for his insight on the challenge of change that we have to change thing across the board in housing access to employment and transport thing that be way beyond the bound of the bill we should use this bill to drive that forward we should look around our community and see the creative approach that we can use on saturday have lovely day out in the sunshine at curly farm on the isle of sheppey in my constituency it be an active farm set up by two father to support their son who have profound learning disability and autism it bring in child with learn disability autism mental health challenge and behavioural challenge generally it be something like the challenging behaviours foundation which my hon friend the member for rochester and strood lauren edwards talk about and which be also very active in my constituency be glad to host an event for it the farm really show we that when we get people out of institutional setting and outdoors into different environment they can thrive in way that they do not in school or in healthcare setting it be transformational to the life of the child and young people who go there who often go on to work in agriculture be sure that many other hon member see that my hon friend be absolutely right to say that patient with challenging behaviour should not be detain in mental health ward for many many year they should be in different setting do he agree that we do not have enough support or accommodation for patient we need to invest more in community setting for some of these patient with challenging behaviour my hon friend have jump ahead of on that not surprisingly give his background as mental health nurse that be absolutely true we do need to invest more but we need to think beyond the nhs although this be the mental health bill and it have health in its name this issue be much big than the service that the nhs can provide there be weakness in this bill the concern have which several other member have mention be that it do not tie we down to tight timeline for this transformation the bill provide get out that be do to ensure that service in the community be properly set up but worry that that the timeline will slip and slip the time to move be now people have be languish for too long in setting that do not offer they therapeutic way forward and in place that be frankly inhumane and breach what we would all consider to be our human right the minister be here and listen and recommend that he think about how we can get an active plan so that we do not let this issue slip but actively ensure support for service in the community invest in they where need and foster they very much support what my hon friend be say about make sure that there be an active plan one of my concern be that implementation of this bill will be delay until community support be ready do he agree that it would be welcome if the minister offer reflection on what good look like in this space and what ready look like so that we know what we be aim for absolutely agree we should flip this around from delay until we be absolutely ready to an active process of decide what good look like two week ago in my constituency run mental health conference that be largely because as be go around as new mp talk to every different organisation could mental health be right at the top of nearly all their worry list whether it be the food bank the school the police the prison or organisation in my community that have set themselves up to support people with mental health have mentalk in sittingbourne and mentalk in sheppey they work in different way but that show the level of pressure that exist locally all of those organisation bring out mental health as their big worry even if it be not their primary purpose just bring people together and get they to talk together people who perhaps have not talk to each other until that point really make difference you could see it in the room on that day be sure be way behind the curve compare with lot of other member who have be do this sort of stuff already but for it really show that we have get to be active in push this forwards what we have learn from and the long term plan for the nhs be that it be the implementation that matter it be not the word in the strategy it be get an implementation plan really tight and fast on the ground give that the impact assessment talk about as key point would like to see commitment in the bill to produce workable plan by at the late one that can give we the road map we need for the future that have be call for by organisation such as mencap and the national autistic society so really commend it to the minister despite have work in healthcare for most of my career and serve on the health and social care select committee have listen to the speech thus far this evening feel in awe of the experience of hon member on both side of the house especially the hon member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna and my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer also commend the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan who know be support by my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt for his extraordinarily powerful speech this bill be essentially about the duty of care not only to those who have mental health issue but to the public include the family friend carer public servant and everyone else who interact with those individual the duty of care also exist to protect those individual from themselves as many member have say our hope and ambition should be that as few people as possible find themselves in crisis situation therefore entirely endorse and support the comment about ensure that we have proper and well fund mental health service both in the community and in the acute setting the hon member mention support for the person need help to help themselves and also to help society do he agree that more and more people be get into situation where they do not feel that they be be help and that they just feel incarcerated and restrict agree with the hon gentleman that more can be do to help people in crisis what would say however think my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge also make this point be that there be people who be at such point that unfortunately they need to be incarcerate in order to be able to help themselves hopefully they spend their time incarcerate not just away from society but be treat effectively and appropriately that bring to the point that this be balance act and difficult situation think all of we of all party be clear that the current act be no long fit for purpose especially when we think about forensic mental health as such be glad that the government be take forward this legislation which be start under the previous government the cross party consensus we have hear this evening reflect the fact that this piece of legislation have come from both of the major party be likely to be on the bill committee after the whitsun recess so will not test the patience of the house by go through every single bit of the bill have some interest in or concern about but will briefly raise three important area which be pleased be raise by member in the other place number of opposition amendment be table in the other place which would have strengthen the bill and hope they will be make in committee in this place the first area be reduce unnecessary police involvement the noble lord kamall and baroness may table some amendment that in my view represent very significant and much need shift in how detention and removal under the mental health act can be manage under the current framework the power to detain individual and move they to place of safety particularly under section and be largely restrict and fall under the responsibility of police officer although those provision be design to protect the public they can often result in the criminalisation of people in acute mental health crisis even when there be no threat of violence or risk to other the amendment table in the other place would have allow authorised and qualified health professional such as paramedic approve mental health professional or specialised nurse to carry out those detention and to move individual under section and of the act that would relieve police officer of responsibility that fall outside their core expertise while reduce the stigma and trauma associate with police lead intervention it would streamline the process ensure that individual be support by professional train specifically in mental health care and would maintain police involvement only where there be clear and present risk to safety that would significantly change and strengthen the system place mental health crisis more firmly within the domain of health rather than law enforcement section and of the current mental health act give the police the power to break into someone property or detain somebody in public place where there be the possibility of the involvement of weapon do the hon member think that health professional would be able to manage those kind of situation would the police not be the good people to deal with those situation be sorry if be not clear for the hon gentleman think have make it very clear that be talk about situation in which there be no risk to other professional clearly in the situation he describe the police be entirely the right people to be involve the second area that want to touch on be that of strengthen safeguard for vulnerable child what would like to see introduce be an essential safeguard for child and young people within the mental health care system as my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge mention the current legislation allow for nominated person to be appoint to represent the child interest in my view though it do not provide adequate protection against the risk that that person could be coercive abusive or in other way inappropriate particularly in case involve look after child or those with complex family dynamic as such would like to see amendment make that address that gap by establish clear criterion for who can be appoint as child nominate person for look after child the local authority would automatically become the nominate individual ensure oversight by public body accountable for the child welfare for other child only individual with legal parental responsibility such as guardian or someone name in court order should be appoint such measure would ensure that no vulnerable child would be expose to undue influence during what may be one of the most difficult or disorient time in their life they would align mental health law with broad child protection standard and reinforce the principle that safeguarding must be at the heart of any mental health intervention involve child finally want to see amendment make that would introduce more patient voice and accountability accept that in its current form the bill make step in the right direction but would like to see an amendment make mirror the one that be table in the other place by the noble lords howe and kamall such an amendment would introduce the valuable and forward look provision of mandatory debrief session within day of discharge from detention under part of the mental health act that session would be lead by an independent mental health advocate and would provide patient with the opportunity to reflect on their experience raise any concern about their treatment and offer feedback in safe supportive and non judgmental setting that would be more than just procedural addition it represent shift in culture which think we would all agree with towards embed patient voice and accountability in the mental health care system it recognise the importance of empower individual after detention support their recovery and learning from their live experience to improve future service mental health charity and third sector organisation have strongly endorse the proposal so hope the minister will give some indication in his wind up that he would support similar amendment take together these reform prioritise professional clinical opinion safeguard child from inappropriate influence during period of acute vulnerability and elevate the patient voice in the post care process in do so they align the mental health act close to modern standard of care international good practice and evolve public expectation these amendment be essential to strengthen the bill ensure that our mental health system become not only more effective but more compassionate responsive and just the mental health bill be long overdue update to the mental health act and hope it will be the start of much wide overhaul of mental health system that be often not fit for purpose and have historically be treat as secondary to the physical health system it be system where too often patient voice be ignore injustice be common and the use of detention be rely upon in the place of person centre community care too frequently those in acute mental health crisis can not access the right support they be refuse help in the community force to rely on accident and emergency and detain against their will as their mental health deteriorate incidence of detention be three time high in the most deprive area black british people be detain at time the rate of white people and those with learn disability autism be at unique and increase risk from detention and the impact that it can have on their life will initially focus on that latter group declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on learn disability under the act as we have hear learn disability or autism in themselves can be reason for detention the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer say that we will disagree on this and be afraid that we will because do not think that learn disability or autism be necessarily condition of the mind number of these condition be genetic and also affect the physical health of person rise be sure the hon member will want to come in on this appreciate the hon member give way there be logical inconsistency which be that people with autism and learning disability be look after under mental health service for autism and learning disability if the argument be well those condition should not be within the scope of mental health act one could make an argument that they should not be within scope of mental health service full stop thank the hon member for his intervention would welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue in more detail with he although we will probably continue to disagree people with learn disability and autism can suffer from mental health condition as much as the rest of the population but they have unique set of challenge point out as note to policymaker in general that they should not conflate learning disability and autism as one and the same thing that be vital at the end of january in patient in lock mental health facility be autistic or live with learn disability as one of my hon friend say early the average length of stay for these patient be nearly five year for those with learn disability or autism locked mental health ward can be live hell for someone with sensory issue reliance on routine need for specialist diet or equipment or myriad other need be in busy over stimulate environment often with strip lighting and minimal privacy often mean they be set up to fail from the very beginning my hon friend be make an important speech and know that her experience in this issue be almost second to none she be make point about how those with learn disability be confine in the way she suggest could add to their mental health issue support they in the community would alleviate lot of those mental health issue in the long term that be well for they and for the community will come to that point little later but that confinement be detrimental to their mental health it can sometimes be hard to pick apart co exist or co occur mental health condition from the behaviour exhibit within that environment this be part of the reason that it be all but impossible for some detain individual in the circumstance they be in to demonstrate the behaviour change they need to prove they have become sufficiently well to be release my attention be draw last year to the case of young woman call bethany who be detain for the good part of half decade under the mental health act she be an autistic young woman whose parent believe that she enter secure unit be the good choice however she end up be lock up for day week and then month on end in room with only mattress on the floor she be unable to see her family or her support network and her parent be absolutely devastate at be unable to get she out of that environment and see she continually deteriorate it be hard to imagine the anguish of people see someone that they love go through this when this happen to someone or their family how on earth can they ever again trust the system that put they there learning disabled people and autistic people who have be through that have their confidence in access support take away in turn that can create vicious cycle strongly welcome the move that this bill make towards remove learn disability and autism as reason alone for detention however similar to my hon friend the member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna note that the government have say that these change to detention criterion will only be switch on when system can demonstrate sufficient level of community support that be source of real concern as the nhs confederation have warn the success of the reform will be dependent on the wide infrastructure to support the bill as other have say there be no clarity on what sufficient level of support mean in practice we do not know where we be head or when we will have get there the most successful support for learn disabled and autistic people to live independently in their community be integrate care that encompass health housing occupation and much more besides would welcome the minister assurance on how that will be deliver in the timescale set out and how we get from where we be now to where good be the continual detention of people in this way should shame we all and an end to that can not come fast enough sound note of caution think this be fairly similar to that of the hon member for runnymede and weybridge that the legislation continue to allow for the co occurrence of mental health condition to be reason to detain someone with learn disability and autism that in and of itself could lead to this continual cycle where people be detain for long than be necessary for their treatment while in an environment that be entirely counterproductive to they become well we also need those with specialism in learn disability and autism to be present in assess whether an individual also have co occur mental health condition finally put plea in to the minister that there be real need for those who live with learn disability or autism to be properly consult number of disabled people charity that be run by people with learn disability such as the bring people home from hospital campaign which be operate under the auspex of inclusion london do not feel that they have have sufficient opportunity to input very minor point be that some relevant document relate to this legislation have not be print in easy read if they have it have take while for they to arrive people who have live experience of these condition be unable to contribute in meaningful way more broadly welcome the legislation attempt to make progress in put patient voice at the heart of care particularly through advance choice document but there be scope to go far the royal college of psychiatrists be advocate for statutory right to an advance choice document which the pre legislative scrutiny committee also recommend that would ensure that all patient who would benefit from one would get one with the aim of reduce detention and involuntary treatment while recognise the importance of this step and this legislation alongside the government investment in mental health crisis centre pledge to recruit mental health staff and the secretary of state commitment to the mental health investment standard there be desperate need to transform community mental health service to put patient voice and experience at its heart and avoid the need for detention order in the first place as member of the health and social care committee have have the privilege of hear from some extraordinarily courageous individual who share their experience of live with serious mental illness it be in that same spirit that will share my own experience now hope that it offer an insight into the limitation of our current system be diagnose with obsessive compulsive disorder as teenager and with bipolar disorder in my in two and half decade with these condition have receive good care but sadly that be the exception and not the rule have never be ask what it be that want from treatment what it be that want for my life and how can be help to get there have receive care that be patronising reductive inconsistent and non existent during mental health crisis have have to tread fine line between prove that be ill and sometimes extremely ill and prove that be not so ill that need to lose my liberty because know that more often than not treatment be base not on therapeutic care but on risk management like thousand of other have have to create my own care package and my own route to treatment because make the decision that deserve to live and deserve to live well and also that my child deserve their mum however be very aware that my ability to do this be base on number of privilege in no small part very supportive family which so many do not have while welcome the bill for its advance in reduce the amount of detention and increase the agency of those who be detain must call for significant overhaul of community mental health service to prevent crisis from occur in the first place we know that we can and must do well ask all member to note that when we discuss people serious mental illness we often talk as though they be other which they be not let say this there be someone stand here among you member of parliament who have serious mental illness it do not prevent from do my job or from live my life in some way it make well at it while the bill continue its passage through parliament can we please bear in mind that we be talk about individual and individual who will be affect by it and that what we seek to do and what hope we will accomplish be give people who live with serious mental illness the ability and the right to live the good life that they possibly can with all the support that we can make available the hon lady family must be very proud wish to draw the house attention to the appalling case of young man who be very badly fail by mental health service and indeed tragically lose his life as result today be represent his family my constituent graeme sam and kaitlyn who have be campaign to ensure that no other family have to go through the distress that they have endure and continue to endure declan morrison be year old when he die he have complex need and require some of the most specialist care and support throughout his life he have autism associate severe learning disability bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder he be non verbal and require hour residential care which he have need and receive since he be year old declan behaviour could be challenging and at time he would injure himself and sometimes latterly staff member care for he that be why it be so important that he be support by those who know he well and who be able to understand his behaviour and therefore provide as good they could for his need his family be unable to provide he with the care he need in their home and have to put their trust in the system and specialist carer to make sure that he be look after sadly their trust be break with the most devastating consequence declan be move into his final residential home in may after the previous placement have become unable to meet his need although in subsequent independent safeguarding adult review follow his death that decision be call into question for brief period declan seem to settle into his new placement but quite quickly staff at the care home raise concern that they could not safely care for he owe to his behaviour which have become particularly challenging however attempt to find an alternative single space home for he which he need fail there be nothing available not single appropriate placement so he remain in that placement for further month with his mental and physical health worsen will not describe here what life be like for declan and his family at this time because it be too distressing my hon friend be make an important point about lack of provision do he agree that the year timescale for ensure that that provision be available be critical if the government could speed that up it would be extremely helpful in instance such as this entirely agree and will come on to make that very point needless to say event take very dark and ultimately heartbreaking turn in march serious incident occur declan become very distressed and assault some staff member police be call and number of officer assist staff to restrain declan as last resort he be detain under section of the mental health act and take to the section suite at fulbourn hospital some may not be aware that under the law patient who be place in section suite should be there for no more than hour or hour in extreme circumstance declan be there for day in an emergency suite that be entirely unsuitable for person with his severe need day while more than place be contact day during which not one bed in suitable accommodation could be find locally regionally or nationally for he finally he simply could not cope and he bang his head repeatedly against wall inflict catastrophic head injury on himself he be take to hospital and operate on but he die some day later in april when his family make the heart wrench decision to turn off his life support it be painfully relevant that we be debate the mental health bill today because clause and specifically address the detention of people with autism and learning disability like declan the bill would limit detention for treatment under section of the act but must ask the minister would these provision have be enough to prevent declan tragedy his case highlight the critical importance of have appropriate crisis provision and suitable community placement available not just in theory but in reality the coroner report on declan death and the independent care review find major failing in the system that be suppose to protect and care for he he be acknowledge to have be in crisis for month ultimately there be and there remain an enormous shortage of available placement for someone with declan complex need both in the community and within the nhs as declan father tell in word that hope will be heed the reliance on the section suite to contain autistic individual while they be in crisis be abhorrent and must be see as breach of the human rights act declan sister kaitlyn have call for specific crisis provision to be fund and create for individual with autism who need designate place of safety when experience severe mental health crisis such provision would need appropriately train and experienced staff in fact one be create in cambridgeshire follow declan death sadly the funding be pull and it close but it operate at capacity when it be open show the very real and immediate need for this kind of provision to exist permanently and across the country the bill place new duty on integrate care board and local authority to provide community support for people with autism and learning disability but how will the government ensure that the duty it outline translate into sustainable service that prevent case like declan from ever happen again duty without resource be merely word on paper although it be welcome that clause remove police station and prison as place of safety declan case show that even designate section suite can be wholly inappropriate for individual with complex need how will the government ensure that appropriate alternative be in place before the provision commence note with deep concern that the government anticipate that full implementation of the bill could take up to year which be too long for vulnerable people to continue to be at risk in the light of the coroner finding in declan case will the government commit to prioritise the provision relate to autistic people and those with learn disability particularly the development of appropriate crisis service as outline in the bill on behalf of graeme sam kaitlyn and all those people like declan ask the government whether they be satisfied that the provision set out in the bill will prevent tragedy like this one from ever happen again if not urge they to make change to ensure that it will for declan and all those with autism and learning disability who deserve well from our mental health system we must make sure that the bill deliver the change they need not in year but now their life depend on it it be humble to contribute to debate with contribution like that from the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom pay tribute to he for share declan story in this place and to my hon friend the member for thurrock jen craft for her very personal contribution warmly welcome the fact that the government be give this issue the prioritisation that it richly deserve the reform will give patient great choice and enhance right and ensure that everybody be treat with dignity and respect throughout treatment will make three broad point about mental health service in england and how they relate to the passage of this bill the first be about cumbria hide crisis cumbria suicide rate be high than that in the rest of the country over five people die from suicide every month in cumbria more than double the number of road death each one of these life lose be tragedy they leave behind family friend co worker neighbour and emergency worker web of people in the community who try to make sense of the grief loss and shock some fantastic local organisation in my constituency be work to bring that number down include every life matters andy man club and the west cumbria mental health partnership but they be fight grow problem of deplete resource it be in this context that we need excellent mental health service so it be particularly welcome that week after the general election last year the government fund new initiative call hope haven an open access mental health hub with some accommodation attach to it this new service be be build by brilliant local partner in my constituency as we speak and have high hope for the contribution that it can make however the new service have come at the same time that cumbria northumberland tyne and wear nhs foundation trust have make the regrettable decision to close yewdale ward an in patient mental health ward in whitehaven that be the only in patient service in the area if it do close patient will need to travel for over an hour to reach the near in patient service and the community have very poor public transport option have call for the icb to investigate the process that have be follow to reach the decision so that we can pause the closure if we be to improve mental health service across our country the reform need to work for rural isolated and coastal area too my second broad point be about the need of people with experience of grow up in the care system and the link to mental health service care experienced adult be hugely over represent in our system of mental health detention assessment and treatment so the much need reform will be particularly welcome change for this group on the important issue of suicide and the extremely high rate in cumbria do my hon friend and constituency neighbour agree that it be extremely important that coroner work with and provide information to local authority and local health service to ensure that we can deliver meaningful policy on anti suicide strategy in area like cumbria thank my constituency neighbour for suggest the type of solution that we should look at some area of the country have much high rate of suicide than other and we know far too little about why those area have those trend around half of child in care be expect to have some sort of mental health disorder and they be estimate to be four to five time more likely than the rest of the child population to have mental health need despite that child in care be disproportionately reject for support from camhs service and this build up unmet mental health need for which we as country be pay the price in social and economic cost far down the line just one example of that be the surge in deprivation of liberty order that we have see in recent year in there be application in the figure be deprivation of liberty order application often leave judge in our family court with impossible choice over the secure accommodation option for child young people who grow up in the care system should receive the very good that our country have to offer with help be speedy and tailor although wide change be need to make that reality humanise our mental health legislation in the way set out in this bill will make difference my hon friend have talk with real passion and expertise about child in care and he make some really important point do he agree that the mental health support we give to young carer young people who support family member be equally important they make such huge difference to our community and the nhs and they too should be support absolutely we need to support young carer and young people in care one of the common challenge face both of those population be that service sometimes fail to look at what support can be provide to the whole family unit so take my hon friend point finally will say few word about sensitive issue that be grow trend most week visit school in my constituency and there be grow theme teacher and now parent be raise concern about the potential over diagnosis or misdiagnosis of adhd and mild autism raise this point for two reason first because the risk be that the scale of the increase in diagnosis be so great that it may take away much need mental health service from those with acute and genuine need and secondly because we have yet to grasp the potential negative impact of treat what may be social challenge as medical disorder some child be currently await an adhd assessment and rate of diagnosis have rise sharply in recent year diagnosis vary dramatically depend on where someone live who do the assessment and worryingly the socioeconomic background of the individual be my hon friend able to name an intervention for diagnosis of mild autism that could be consider medical intervention not something to address one of the social issue he have identify that could harm the individual yes in number of school we have see grow number of adhd and mild autism diagnosis that do not come with any form of treatment that be in system where there be an expectation that education health and care plan will be fill and meet by multiple agency and the family be often leave battle the system have to fight for diagnosis to get that label and then find that the help be not there my argument be that those family not all but some of they be battle system that already have finite resource and now spend huge proportion of its resource gatekeepe when actually we should step back and look at what support the young person and their family need in the case of adhd the national institute for health and care excellence guideline set out very clearly that before an assessment be make it should be establish whether parenting support could be put in place to help my guess be that in many case at the moment that offer of parenting support be not in place before an adhd diagnosis be make diagnosis of autism have double in the last five year be not say that that be incorrect but think the question need to be ask as part of the wide debate whether that grow trend be reflection of previously undiagnosed autism or because of recent change in the manual the edition of the international classification of be be bring into that diagnosis who would previously have be support in other way close by urge the government to consider the implication of the reform of mental health service for those in rural and remote community they need to acknowledge the benefit that will come from these measure for those with care experience but also to think deeply about the need for residential care that can meet their need for secure setting they should also consider way in which we as country can have full and rich conversation about the grow diagnosis of adhd and mild autism so that we can establish the good route of support for the child cry out for support and the parent often battle against the system who may be build up future need for the crisis mental health service we have be speak about this evening before begin want to pay tribute to right hon and hon member for their extremely informed personal and move speech in support of the positive element of the bill and for make extremely important constructive suggestion about how to make it even well than it be stand today to speak in strong support of the bill and the urgent and long overdue reform of our mental health legislation the mental health act now year old be design for different era while it have provide legal framework for detain and treat individual in crisis it no long reflect our modern understanding of mental illness patient right or good clinical practice as we have hear the act govern both civil patient and those involve in the criminal justice system and it include power such as community treatment order but it be clear that the system it underpin be no long fit for purpose the need for reform be stark and obvious patient detain under the act often have little say in their treatment or about who be involve in their care as we have hear racial disparity be deeply entrenched with black or black british people time more likely to be detain and time more likely to be place under community treatment order the journey towards reform begin with the independent review lead by sir simon wessely which identify rise detention rate poor patient experience and systemic disadvantage for people with learn disability and autism draft bill follow in and commend the government for take forward the propose bill each year approximately individual be detain under the mental health act alarmingly as have mention black individual be nearly four time more likely to be detain and time more likely to be place under cto furthermore nearly young people be detain annually yet over half report that their hospital stay do not aid their recovery these statistic be not just number they be call to action there be serious concern about the treatment of people with learn disability and autism while the bill rightly end inappropriate detention under section of the mental health act when there be no co occur mental illness the delay in implementation due to the lack of resource raise fear of criminalisation misdiagnose and exclusion from aftercare we need fully cost plan with clear target and accountability to support this vulnerable group mind the lead mental health charity have identify further three critical area in which the bill must go far the first be tackle racial disparity the disproportionate detention of black individual under the current act be glare injustice the bill must include measure to reduce this disparity such as limit on the use of community treatment order and the introduction of responsible person to oversee treatment decision additionally statutory duty to monitor and report on progress against these inequality be essential therefore support the creation of dedicated role to monitor and act on racial disparity in detention and treatment secondly the principle of least restriction be central to the bill yet it remain aspirational there be no enforceable right patient should have statutory right to assessment and treatment the ability to appeal treatment decision and expand access to advocacy service these right be about not just legal protection but respect the dignity and autonomy of individual face mental health challenge thirdly young people detain under the mental health act often find themselves without adequate support or voice in decision about their care the bill must include transparent decision make test tailor for child and young people to ensure that their good interest be at the forefront of all treatment decision there should also be safeguard and the standardisation of advance choice document the government say that the implementation timeline could be up to decade but urge they to implement each element of the bill as soon as be practically possible this bill be very welcome and this be pivotal moment in the history of mental health care in our country it be huge step forward but it could go far to truly transform mental health care we must ensure that the legislation be not only progressive in its intention but robust in its protection we have the opportunity to create system that uphold the right dignity and humanity of every individual let we therefore not pass up this chance to make all the necessary change let we amend this bill to reflect the value of equality autonomy and respect and take this once in generation opportunity to build fit for purpose mental health system that be fair more compassionate and more effective urge the government to take this opportunity to address the gap take heed of the recommendation and concern and make the bill right and proper rise order want to retain the tone of this debate but to get everybody in we will have speak limit of seven minute which be still quite long time it be pleasure to be call to speak in this second reading debate prior to be elect to this house work for year in nhs mental health service and be the chair of the all party parliamentary group on mental health this be an issue care about deeply it have be widely accept that the mental health act be outdate and the need to modernise it have be talk about for some time pay tribute to baroness may who when she be prime minister commission professor sir simon wessely to undertake an independent review of the act and commend this labour government for introduce the bill without delay as member will be aware last week be mental health awareness week the discussion take part in show how far we have come in remove much of the stigma around mental ill health but fear that lot of stigma remain when it come to discuss severe mental ill health such as case of schizophrenia therefore welcome the importance that the government have attach to the bill and to update the law so that it be fit for the century hope that through our deliberation we can play our part in ensure that severe mental ill health be treat with the respect and understanding it deserve the mental health act provide the legal framework for the detention of people when their mental ill health mean that they be at risk to themselves or other so that they can receive appropriate treatment the bill look to modernise that legal framework welcome clause which adopt the four principle of treatment propose in sir simon wessely independent review by adopt those principle the legislation will give patient great choice enhance right and support and ensure that be treat with dignity and respect be an integral part of their treatment this reform be long overdue we talk great deal about want to deliver personalise care in our health service that should be the guide principle in every part of the service especially for the most vulnerable adopt the principle be about redress the balance of power away from the system so that the patient have more autonomy and more say over their treatment that will help to ensure that those in society with the most severe mental health condition get well more personalised care also welcome the statutory role that clause to will give nominate person who will have great say over the patient treatment and care replace the old hierarchical list of relative with person who have be select by the patient albeit that there will be certain safeguard in place be an update to the legislation to reflect today world clause deal with the application of the mental health act to autistic people and those who have learn disability the clause modify the definition of mental disorder by introduce new definition of autism learn disability and psychiatric disorder as result people with learn disability or those who be autistic can no long be detain or make subject to community treatment order unless they have co occurring psychiatric disorder this be welcome and long overdue change under the mental health act autistic people and those with learn disability have experience inappropriate care over medication and extended period of detention as we look to modernise the act it be wholly appropriate to ensure that they can not be detain unless they have co occurring psychiatric disorder however concern have be express in part of the learn disability and autism sector that the change may have unintended consequence for example it may lead to an increase in alternative route to detention in particular concern have be raise that people with high risk behaviour who require treatment in appropriate and safe hospital environment may end up have to be deal with by the criminal justice system if they can not be detain under the mental health act these concern be debate when the bill be consider in the other place but would be grateful if the minister could say whether the government have give any further consideration to those point would also be grateful if he could give an assurance that he and his official will engage with the learn disability and autism sector as the bill continue through this house in the other place the conservatives be successful in amend the bill to allow the extension of police power of detention under section and to other specify healthcare professional the amendment provoke serious concern from representative of healthcare professional and understand it be not support by the police either the right care right person model put in place in have already reduce the time the police have to deal with mental health patient will the government look into overturn that amendment would also be grateful if he say how the government will build on the bill to ensure wide reform of and investment in mental health and how we can ensure that the aim of the bill be accompany by high quality mental health service especially community service for people experience poor mental health in preparation for today debate on thursday as chair of the appg on mental health be pleased to organise for small group of members visit to the mental health centre at the st charles hospital in kensington during our visit we be able to spend time in the mental health crisis assessment service this excellent facility be open hour day seven day week for anyone in the area who be experience mental health crisis recommend that such facility be institute across the country especially in my constituency in ashford there be no mental health emergency facility over people whose primary issue be record as mental ill health present themselves at the department at the william harvey hospital in such facility would help to prevent that press for more support to be put in place alongside the bill welcome the direction of the mental health bill it mark long overdue shift in how we treat some of the most vulnerable in our society recognise that people deserve more than crisis care they deserve dignity choice and autonomy it have be real privilege to be in the chamber for this important debate and to hear the very moving speech by my hon friend the member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom and by so many other across the chamber who share their constituent story and their own the bill rightly put patient at its centre it give they more say in their treatment improve the complaint process and introduce personalise care plan replace the outdated near relative with nominate person reflect broad move toward more respectful person centre system that listen empower and support recovery but here be the uncomfortable truth however well intentione the bill will achieve little unless we confront the funding crisis already engulf our mental health service the bill ask overstretched and underpaid staff to deliver change that demand time and care when many be already at break point my constituent across guildford see that every single day jennifer come to in despair over the care that her daughter leah be receive at local mental health unit chronic understaffing and lack of support mean that concern go unanswered underfunding have create cycle of inadequate care treatment refuse early discharge to free up bed and inevitable readmission when leah need be leave unmet have hear from samantha whose son suffer psychotic episode that end in tragedy stark reminder of what happen when crisis go unsupported also want to mention the story of young woman whom will not name but who make series of attempt on her life until she tragically succeed after gain access to poison from overseas know this be not unique story and that multiple coroner have write to the secretary of state for health and his predecessor on this issue will the minister agree to meet to discuss the case and whether it may be possible to use the mental health bill to prevent further similar death there be also the fact that across the country people be wait month and sometimes year for mental health care child and young people be fall through the crack as camhs be overwhelmed and referral be delay patient be send mile from home due to local bed shortage and police be leave to respond to mental health emergency because there be no one else to call our system be not just stretch it be at break point yet the proportion of nhs funding go to mental health care be fall despite soar demand despite mental illness make up fifth of the nhs burden and despite the government promise these be not just gap in the system they be failure of political will as well as nhs funding for direct mental health service do the hon lady agree that we should invest in preventive step to help child to avoid the mental health anguish that they be suffer today absolutely know from my own caseload of too many story of where if young people have receive preventive care and support they would not be face the tragic situation they and their family be now live through this government have scrap key mental health target include goal for early intervention therapy access and physical health check for people with mental illness be sorry but this signal retreat at the very moment we need to advance support the vision outline in the bill but its success depend entirely on the foundation on which it stand without adequate investment even the very good intention will struggle to take root ensure that people can exercise their right and that staff can support they demand more than legislation it demand real resource and sustain commitment from this government we need national effort to rebuild mental health care from the ground up with early intervention for young people train professional in school and community continuity of care and culture shift that treat mental health with the same urgency and seriousness as physical health failure be not an option not for the thousand still wait not for the staff stretch to their limit and not for the community leave to pick up the piece we can and must do well rise to support this important bill have be incredibly humble by some of the speech particularly from the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan and for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom on the lib dem benches from the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer give his experience and of course from my hon friend the members for thurrock jen craft and for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna this bill be incredibly welcome it be long overdue and deserve the urgency and seriousness it be be give have hear from family in my constituency who have wait month and sometimes year for help in many case the waiting list for camhs in southampton exceed two year recently meet grandparent in my constituency who be care for their grandchild who be recently diagnose with autism their grandchild be suffer from poor mental health and be unable to attend school and the family be struggle to access support welcome the government work so far in this area include the pledge to have specialist mental health professional in every school but do my hon friend agree that three year wait for an appointment with camhs as my constituent be face be completely unacceptable my hon friend make an incredibly important point and fully agree that the wait face many people be excruciating have have constituent come to in tear because they do not know whether their child will make it to adulthood the service be just not there and they be subject to hugely long wait and often inadequate provision these change be crucial of course there be some truly commendable local initiative in southampton that be make real difference on the ground pay tribute to service such as the lighthouse an invaluable out of hour mental health support centre for adult in crisis and no limits brilliant charity that have for many year provide wide range of health and wellbee support scheme to child and young people across the city these organisation exemplify the compassion and commitment of professional and volunteer to those who need their service let we be clear though however dedicate those service and the people within they may be they be operate under immense pressure demand have outpace capacity and that be why national action be so urgently need to match that local effort with investment modernisation and the workforce expansion require to ensure that no one be leave behind there be two essential pillar upon which real improvement in mental health provision have to be build the legal framework which the bill rightly seek to modernise and as colleague from across the chamber have mention the funding that underpin the delivery of service reform the law be vital step but without sustained investment in frontline mental health care we risk change the rule without change the reality for patient in my constituency we have statistically significant suicide rate have mention several time in this place that know seven man who have take their own life do my hon friend agree that while funding be important early intervention and preventive care in mental health service be also really good money well spend as former cabinet member for child service have learn through experience that early intervention will always be far well value for money than reactive service which be obviously very necessary but often come too late we need both compassionate up to date legislation and the resource to make it meaningful in practice the bill will bring our mental health law into the century as have be mention the mental health act be as old as the secretary of state be sad to say that both he and the act be still young than be and its provision no long reflect our understanding of mental health or the standard of dignity and agency that we now rightly expect these reform will put patient voice at the centre be pleased that for the first time patient will have great right to make their wish know and to be involve in decision about their own care no one could make that case more eloquently than my hon friend the member for thurrock the bill also rightly recognise the need of child and young people too many of whom be fall through the crack one of the major factor affect their mental health be the pervasive presence of social medium there be grow and compelling evidence that addictive algorithm be lead to increase anxiety depression and low self esteem add to that the impact of cyber bullying social comparison and hour peer pressure and it be little surprise that there be real damage to the mental wellbeing of our young people in my constituency we have see two tragic heartbreake death that be very much about mental health in which online force lead people to the terrible decision to die by suicide we must take action both to prevent and to react to poor mental health the bill give young people the right to express their view in writing and require professional to take those view seriously every child deserve support not silence and the bill will take we in the right direction as have say the reform in the bill be important but will ministers confirm that they will be back up by the funding need to deliver sustainable mental health service in england welcome the fact that the government have commit an additional million to mental health service this year urge ministers to get that money out of whitehall quickly and to the frontline in southampton and other place where it be desperately need be delighted that we now have national plan to recruit new mental health staff which will include place specialist professional in every school when serve as cabinet member for education in southampton we be proud to lead the way by introduce mental health support into our local school with pilot initiative which have have clear and positive impact be delighted that that successful approach be be adopt on national scale be also delighted that this labour government be develop young futures hub across the country to provide the early support for which my hon friend the member for darlington lola mcevoy make the case so eloquently with the aim of keep young people well and importantly out of hospital in the first place where possible we have see the scandal of learn disabled and autistic people be lock in hospital simply because there be nowhere else for they to go the bill will end that inappropriate detention and strengthen community base support when more people die by suicide than in traffic accident and when patient be leave in police cell simply because there be nowhere safe for they to go radical change be the only responsible path we must strive to achieve that change through this mental health bill it have be humble to be part of this debate and to hear powerful contribution from hon member who have so much knowledge in particular the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer and the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan and for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom who make emotive speech welcome the bill and the government recognition that the current legislation be no long fit for purpose with over people detain under the exist mental health act this be an opportunity to modernise system that often fail to provide care fairly and effectively we have hear brutal testimony of that today although support the direction of the bill one area that need great attention be the impact on young people we be see clear and worrying rise in mental health issue among child and teenager yet the bill do not fully guarantee they the same right and safeguard as adult there be still no statutory test for decision make capacity for without it many young people could miss out on key right such as choose responsible nominated person or access the protection around informal admission current guideline say that child should be place on adult ward only in exceptional case but that be still happen far too often in nearly child be admit to an adult psychiatric ward these environment be not design for they child who be place there can lose access to education peer support and age appropriate care this must change it be not only adult ward that be of concern to but the fact that many child be send to live far away from their home and support structure even to other town we must have statutory provision to stop this happening turn to racial inequality the data continue to tell stark story black people be nearly four time as likely to be detain under the mental health act and seven time more likely to be place under community treatment order those order be mean to reduce hospital readmission but they often do not achieve that aim instead they feel indefinite coercive and difficult to challenge and many say that they erode the trust between family and healthcare provider that be why support either abolish cto altogether or ensure that they be subject to regular independent review with clear criterion also support the call to have person in every trust who be responsible for race equity someone with authority and visibility to ensure that training policy and datum be use effectively to address local disparity we need national accountability too that be why an annual report by the secretary of state break down by protect characteristic be vital if we be serious about reduce inequality we must measure understand and act on it finally on autism and learning disability support the decision to remove the ability to detain people without co occur mental health condition however there be real concern that without proper support in the community people may end up be misdiagnose just to fit the criterion for detention or may be leave without appropriate care altogether we need clear costed plan for support integrate care board and local authority to deliver the care people need in the community that mean target proper funding and safeguard to prevent delay and poor outcome we can not afford system where lack of planning result in another decade of delay for this vulnerable group the bill be an important step forward but it be not enough on its own if we want meaningful change we need investment accountability and strong focus on the right of the people who depend on mental health service every day we be all responsible for ensure that this legislation do more than just change the law it must change life it have be an absolute privilege to listen to contribution from member with real expertise and experience wholeheartedly welcome the government mental health bill and be proud that this vital and as we have hear long overdue bill will modernise the woefully out of date mental health act which we know be link to racial inequality poor care for people with learn disability and neurodivergence and which fail to give patient proper voice by modernise the mental health act and make it fit for the century the government be demonstrate that they have the ambition compassion and determination to ensure that patient have great choice autonomy right and support and that all patient be treat with dignity and respect throughout their treatment there be many welcome measure in the bill from strengthen patient right to reform the use of involuntary detention and limit the extent to which people with learn disability can be detain but to ensure that we tackle the crisis in and transform the future of mental health care as whole we must go far and build on these reform nowhere be that need more urgent than in child mental health service where alongside profound societal change the damage to the capacity of the state make by the previous government be most painfully visible and where the cost of inaction be overwhelming the relationship between unhealthy online habit among adolescent and poor mental health be well document the world health organisation report last year that potentially damage social medium use have be show to lead to depression bullying anxiety and poor academic performance but those change have occur at the same time as huge reduction in the availability of youth service and other early intervention the closure of safe community space which provide access to trust role model and stark increase in relative child poverty and homelessness early this month launch constituency survey to hear directly from child and their family to well understand the state of local child mental health service some of the response paint bleak and harrowing picture of parent desperately try to get their child the support they need the initial result of the survey demonstrate that we must focus on two connect area of reform which believe must be part of our wide plan to tackle the mental health crisis first we must begin with early intervention as system wide principle not an afterthought under the previous government the mental health system often fail to intervene in timely consistent and adequate manner it be widely understand that early mental health challenge can significantly impact child development yet service for young child remain insufficient and poorly co ordinated for child in their early year and pre school stage support be often fragment or entirely lacking to address the gap we need cohesive early intervention strategy that do more to integrate early year health and education additionally we must go far by give child access to mental health professional in every primary and secondary school make support not just accessible but familiar and trustworthy school be often where issue be first identify and they must also be where the support start it be brilliant to hear the announcement on friday that that will begin to be roll out but it do need to be accelerate secondly we must overhaul how child access specialist care and tackle the systemic barrier create by high threshold and long wait early intervention work only if there be function system to refer into but that system be break over the last year service have be hollow out waiting list have spiral and threshold for access have be push so high that even child in clear crisis be be turn away have hear countless story of child who be self harm experience suicidal thought or in deep emotional distress be tell they do not meet the criterion for treatment family be leave to watch their child deteriorate terrified helpless and too often unheard that be not care that be the cost of failure that be no reflection on the professional deliver the care my survey show good level of satisfaction but there simply be not enough of it to meet demand unless we expand the service capacity and rethink how threshold be apply the most vulnerable child will continue to fall through the crack no matter how early their need be identify early help must lead somewhere that mean ensure that timely and specialist care be available for those who need it these two reform be not stand alone they be interdependent we can not have meaningful early intervention without timely access to specialist care and for as long as we do not address the root cause of poor mental health child poverty hollow out youth service and weak online safety the problem will continue to get bad the bill along with wide plan to tackle the mental health crisis present the opportunity not only to fix what be break but to create something well mental health system that be accessible equitable and fit for the future be proud to support the bill it be real pleasure to speak in this debate madam deputy speaker thank you for allow the opportunity to make contribution shall begin by say that it be essential that we get this right in his introduction the secretary of state outline his case very well and welcome his policy his strategy and his legal way forward here in westminster also believe that that will set trend for the rest of the region of this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and particularly for northern ireland know that the minister have direct contact every month with the health minister in northern ireland mike nesbitt and that very constructive dialogue take place between the secretary of state here and the minister back home hopefully this will allow all the region across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to ensure that we be all on the same page when it come to mental health support and obligation the minister and the labour government have set strategy in place that welcome mental health have increasingly and rightly come to the forefront of our mind we be now take it on board and teach our child cop mechanism from their early school day for example with teacher practise breathe exercise with child and help and guide teenager through exam situation those thing be happen already we have come forward in leap and bound however this be not sprint this be generational marathon and we be struggle to make the mile marker that be why welcome the whole premise and thrust of the bill the mental health in northern ireland fundamental facts report be launch around month ago and it contain some interesting stat to consider the wide range report show that of people in the most deprived area be likely to have probable mental illness compare with in the least deprived area and that poverty particularly child poverty be key contributor it also show that of child in northern ireland be live in poverty stable housing be also key driver of wellbee and almost of people experience homelessness have diagnose mental health condition in my intervention on the secretary of state early welcome his agreement to share the bill and its recommendation with the health minister in northern ireland because believe that its constructive helpful recommendation will help we to achieve some of the aspiration and policy of the government and the minister here the report also highlight the association between poor mental health outcome and adverse childhood experience with of young people age to experience at least one adverse childhood experience young people in the least deprived area be more likely to experience no ace compare with those in the most deprive area one in five adult and one in eight child in northern ireland have probable mental illness accord to the report with rate in adult similar to other region however our history of conflict and some year of terrorist campaign with terrorist murder and the ira try to kill unionists and those who object to their way of life have repercussion and contribute to more complex mental health difficulty in the population this be snapshot of any and indeed all of the region in the united kingdom we be all face the same difficulty and we all need more effective solution and support for individual and family have have many anxious parent whose child have be refer to child and adolescent mental health service the waiting list in northern ireland have approximately total wait for camhs assessment with over half of that number wait for more than nine week these be child who may be self harm or have ocd and whose body be feel the effect of obsessive hand washing when stress these be just some of the thing that young people have to deal with there be so many thing that affect their education this be why welcome the aim of new section which provide for the making of arrangement for ensure that care education and treatment review meeting take place for child education hope and future be essential and welcome this aim it be all about give hope and think every one of we as an elect representative want to give hope to our constituent to the parent and to the child of well future that be why we welcome this positive bill gently question whether the bill go far enough in its legal obligation for child review on education and health look to the minister for his opinion on whether more should be do to ensure that child and vulnerable adult have pathway to education and well health programme and therefore hope and well future we must not have postcode lottery indeed child and vulnerable adult in each region deserve the same right and deserve dedication and service hope that while this bill apply only in england and wales it will make change for the good of the entire united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and will put in stone use that political term focus that all can benefit from the minister and the secretary of state give commitment in my intervention look forward to the minister continue his positive thought on how we can all gain because tonight be one of they good night in this house have speak many time in this house about mental health because see the impact of poor mental health every day in blackpool in our community our family and tragically our child and young people today want to focus the house attention on they as mental health advocate and former chairman of an award win mental health charity in blackpool have witness grow and urgent need to support our young people now as the mp for my home town in the midst of severe mental health crisis desperate parent come to every day ask for help mother recently contact about her year old daughter in just four month her child attempt to take her own life three time by overdose the minimal support they have be hard fight for and it be inconsistent and incohesive the family be on constant high alert in case their daughter try to take her own life again as new parent can not comprehend how they must be feel day to day no family should be leave in that situation let alone have to fight for the help that should be there from the outset early this month sit down with young people parent teacher community leader and the police to discuss the link between bullying and mental ill health among the brave young people who share their story be elsie she speak about how bully about her appearance begin in primary school and intensify in secondary school she become anxious and depressed and eventually stop go to school she be move from top to bottom set and her academic attainment plummet she tell she hat herself but because she be see as one of the one that be act up she be punish by the adult around she she be see as the problem the real problem be that no one listen and the painful truth be that her experience be far from unique when young people speak up about their mental health our job be first to listen and then to act that be why this mental health bill matter it deliver on the government commitment to modernise the mental health act and give people great autonomy to ensure that everyone be treat with dignity and respect during their care it strengthen the voice of patient give statutory weight to their right to be involve in decision about their treatment increase scrutiny of detention and seek to limit the use of the early act to detain those with learn disability the most recent nhs figure show around hospital admission of to year old in blackpool due to self harm in the year to march sharp rise from about the year before that be more than double the national average child in patient admission for mental health condition in blackpool be also significantly high than the national average child in care care leaver young carer and those live in poverty be especially vulnerable and too often be the one fail most severely this inadequacy extend to detention we know that people live in deprive area be more than three and half time more likely to be detain under the mental health act than those in more affluent part of the country that be staggering and unacceptable disparity and the sad reality for my constituent in blackpool south the bill take much need step forward introduce day limit on detain people with learn disability or autism who do not have co occur mental health condition support the reform but it can not come into effect until we have sufficient community service which my community be cry out for in that context welcome the plan to expand community base support the government have commit to walk in mental health hub in every community more accessible support worker and specialist mental health professional in every school all desperately need in blackpool those essential step must be back by funding urgency and clear timeline because right now our youth mental health service be stretch beyond capacity young people in blackpool and across the country be too often place on adult ward send far from home or leave to fend for themselves until they reach crisis point my hon friend make powerful point have have stark case in my constituency involve young woman age with anorexia sadly because we do not have the in patient facility in our area she be detain and confine to wheelchair she do not feel that her wish or those of her mother be take into account during her stay she be eventually place in an in patient ward out of county do he agree that one of the bill strength be that it will give my constituent voice and right to have her wish hear completely agree family member of mine be recently suffer from mental health crisis but could not be place in blackpool and have to go hundred of mile away that be not acceptable patient must have great say and they need more support mental health charity mind point out that child be be restrain ignore and leave to navigate confusing system alone that be not system build on dignity or care we must strengthen legal safeguard for child and young people urge the government to introduce statutory framework for assess capacity in without one their voice be too easily sideline statutory care and treatment plan should be extend to every young person who receive mental health care we need strong protection for child place in inappropriate or unsafe setting far from their family and community in their consideration of these reform will the government clarify how they plan to implement the new model of specialised mental health service for child and young people particularly in the light of the abolition of nhs england what specific provision will be include for child and young people in the update service specification and legislative reform will the government commit to series of sustained reform of the wide system so that child and young people can access effective early support in their community before they ever reach crisis point the bill can not be see in isolation from the wide challenge face young people mental health reform the mental health act be crucial but it must be match by real world change to service staff and support on the ground elsie story of unchecked bullying at school affect her mental health and future prospect matter as do the thousand of untold story from child across the country they deserve system that listen to they value their voice and respond with the care that they need they deserve support that meet they wherever they be not once they have already reach the edge they deserve the dignity compassion and care that the bill aspire to deliver let we ensure that we do not waste this opportunity may say how humble be to follow such powerful and personal contribution from many hon member welcome these long overdue reform of the mental health act be extremely proud to be part of government who be move so quickly to ensure that people who experience severe mental illness be give more autonomy and choice be always treat with dignity and respect and be give enhance right and support under the bill mental health be theme of so many of the conversation that have and of the support that try to provide in my aylesbury constituency whether with fay tyler aj and dhwani the young people who join my recent work experience programme and devise the fantastic break the silence campaign to improve mental health understanding for young adult with the resident at bearbrook place which be run by connection support and offer support accommodation for adult face homelessness who tell that their mental health challenge contribute to they become at risk of homelessness and that it be their ongoing mental health recovery give they the most confidence that they could live independently again or with the people who go along to the fantastic drop in provide by the space charity in st mary church many of whom experience mental challenge as result of unexpected life event health struggle or social isolation could go on but this evening will focus on how the bill should improve the experience of pregnant and new mum struggle with severe mental illness that subject be particularly close to my heart as lose one of my good friend sophie middlemiss to suicide shortly after the birth of her little girl her third child speak to many parent about it include the fantastic amy scullard who run the pandas perinatal mental health group in aylesbury in this period of pregnancy and the year after birth almost one in four people struggle with their mental health for many people their experience be relatively mild and they will recover but some people often without any prior mental health challenge and without warning will experience extremely severe mental illness suicide tragically be the lead cause of death for woman in that period from six week to year after birth wish to highlight three aspect of the bill that will be important for people who experience serious mental illness at that stage of their life and who will end up fall within the scope of the bill first the fact that patient will be able to choose nominated person to represent they be vital step forward it be crucial have see at first hand how at the point at which people be severely unwell they be unable to make the good decision for themselves formalise the ability of someone to play that role on their behalf and with more power to challenge the system could make positive difference to their care secondly be pleased that the bill will make individualised care and treatment plan statutory every person be different our attitude to mental health have evolve huge amount since the mental health act be last update and ensure that they have personalise care plan that account for their particular circumstance be crucial so too be the fact that the bill create duty to inform and support patient in make advance choice document before they become ill from place of good health thirdly be pleased that the bill aim to reduce the significant racial inequality that exist under the current act those inequality also drive significant difference in perinatal healthcare outcome more broadly black people be more than three and half time more likely to be detain under the mental health act than white people and more than seven time more likely to be place on community treatment order that have to change the bill introduce measure that should have positive impact for people from ethnic minority for example through the introduction of advance choice document as well as by tighten the criterion for detention and compulsory treatment be conscious of the time madam deputy speaker but wish to make point about the implementation of the bill for people experience severe mental illness in the period after birth mother and baby unit can be crucial part of their recovery as well as have significant benefit for the parent infant relationship too often however whether or not mum can access one of those unit remain postcode lottery believe we must get to point where all woman who have give birth within the month prior to compulsory admission be give the option of be admit to ward where they can remain with their baby be so pleased to see the secretary of state commitment to the mental health investment standard and all the funding that will be need properly to implement the measure in the bill hope that provision for that group of woman at severe risk of serious mental health illness will be consider will conclude by note that for all those who experience milder struggle with their mental health it be clear that there be whole lot more we need to do beyond the bill know minister be conscious of that and lot of vital work be under way include more mental health support in school the recruitment of additional mental health support worker and the roll out of family and youth hub such community provision and service be essential the bill be for those people who struggle with the most severe mental illness and require intensive specialist support for they the bill represent crucial step forward and be proud to support it thank all member who have speak so far to share their professional experience leave feel very under qualified to speak on this matter and those who share their deeply personal contribution we all know the shocking statistic associate with mental health indeed the cost of poor mental health be calculate at billion year in england and the life expectancy of people with severe mental illness be around year short than for those without one wish to draw member attention to man mental health which be an often neglect and overlook area man mental ill health frequently go unrecognised or untreated lead to severe consequence man face unique challenge and be often less likely to seek help about of man in england have mental health disorder only of nhs referral for psychological therapy be for man and many man fear judgment for discuss mental health man can feel pressured to appear strong lead to shame fear of judgment and reluctance to take time off work for mental health reason to add to that list of mental health disparity we must add racial inequality as have be point out by many hon member black people in britain be nearly four time more likely to be sectioned than their white counterpart and the nhs race watchdog have warn that discrimination be play part in those high figure racial discrimination can prevent black and minority ethnic community from access the care they need we know that black african and caribbean community face particular barrier to access specific mental health service they be less likely to self refer to psychological talk therapy and less likely to be refer to such service by their gps in addition the racism racial violence and hate crime that threaten many such community have an additional impact on the mental health of community member often lead to more severe mental illness compound by social injustice discrimination and disadvantage recently visit rochford hospital community and mental health unit that serve my constituency where see for myself the disparity there be significant number of young black people on the ward mix that certainly do not match the make up of our local area we know the terrible toll that poor mental health can have which can wreak havoc on people life my constituency of southend west and leigh lie within essex county that be unfortunately the unwelcome focus of england first public inquiry into mental health death the lampard inquiry be investigate mental health death in essex between and which be yet another shocking statistic it aim to examine the failure in care in essex and hopefully ensure that they be not repeat elsewhere the inquiry have report that the allege failing be on deeply shocking scale and the essex partnership university nhs foundation trust have have to apologise for the harm cause to those affect the director of the charity inquest deborah coles which provide support on state relate death tell the inquiry that many nhs trust be more concerned about their reputation than about the care that they provide for their patient she point to an overuse in restraint segregation and seclusion once again especially with black patient as we have hear the government be commit to drive down poor mental health and the bill be among the step they be take welcome the measure outline in the bill particularly the involvement of patient in decision make throughout their care and the strengthening of their voice for too long patient have be ignore give some of the emerge theme from the lampard inquiry also welcome the measure on increase the scrutiny of detention to ensure that it be use only where necessary and only for as long as necessary and on the importance of have nominate person in place the secretary of state talk about prevention and welcome the other measure that the government be bring in such as the first man health strategy which will also focus on mental health the most tragic figure be on the terrible toll of people who take their own life as result of poor mental health man be disproportionately affect by suicide the statistic be horrify of the register death cause by suicide in be man suicide remain the lead cause of death for man under these be not just statistic real life be be lose sadly have have personal experience of the trauma cause by male suicide and the devastating impact that it have on the family and friend who be leave behind in november my close friend sam bubbly charismatic well like and much love guy with whole future ahead of he unexpectedly take his own life two day before his birthday his loss be still feel by many and there be so many unanswered question we must fix this system speak today in sam memory and in memory of everyone else who have be let down by the level of mental health support available never again want to receive call to say that someone close to have be lose in this way we must do well and be hopeful that we be start to head in the right direction begin by offer my heartfelt thank to everyone who have take part in this debate and offer their professional and powerful personal experience say in my maiden speech that we must never be afraid to learn from those around we and certainly have learn an awful lot today know from experience that poor mental health touch nearly every one of we at some point in our life but despite that be widespread experience it remain deeply personal and be too often isolate that be why wholeheartedly support this government aim of transform mental health care in this country and finally place mental health on an equal footing with physical health achieve that will require significant investment in frontline service shift towards preventive care and healthcare system that put the individual need of patient at its heart welcome the government announcement of plan to recruit an additional mental health staff and the million investment in new mental health crisis centre however even where there be the strong frontline service some individual will always require more intensive tailor support we must do all that we can to help those people in their time of crisis reform of the mental health act be long overdue sir simon wessely independent review in make it clear that we must give patient great freedom of choice over their care and treatment as well as more ownership of it and involvement and engagement with it the bill do just that it replace outdated practice through which patient be treat as passive recipient of care with one that treat they as active partner in their care it introduce choice autonomy and enhanced right and support patient will be give voice through personalise care and treatment plan which will be place on statutory footing the plan will include measurable objective for treatment and recovery with clear pathway towards discharge they will be review regularly so that any change in the patient condition or need be promptly address there be also the welcome use of advance choice document which will enable patient to record their treatment preference in advance so that their voice be hear even if they lose the capacity to make decision during crisis just as importantly this bill recognise the vital role of support network replace the near relative rule with the right to choose nominate person that will ensure that no one face the system alone however alongside that welcome increase in support we must ensure strong safeguard because no one should be detain unless absolutely necessary that be why welcome the bill move to raise the threshold for detention and to more clearly define what constitute mental disorder that will ensure that detention be always last resort additionally there be vital new protection for people with autism and learning disability which so many of my hon friend have speak about so eloquently the provision end the use of police and prison cell as so call place of safety be positive step the reform of section will ensure that those in crisis receive appropriate care and be not treat like criminal these reform represent meaningful change in how we support people at their most vulnerable and will make real difference to thousand of life each year people experience health crisis deserve dignity respect and far well treatment than the system provide for they society have make great progress in de stigmatise mental health and it be time that our law reflect that through this bill we can move close to modern compassionate healthcare service echo the remark of previous speaker it have be privilege to listen to the depth of personal and professional expertise express in this debate do not share that expertise as think will become abundantly obvious in short moment what do you get if you put group of man in room and ask they to talk about mental health half of they leave and the other half run into the corner of the room do not know whether that ring true for the man in your life madam deputy speaker but when hear that it remind of myself hear it from chap call graham in norton in my constituency rather than from graham norton graham have set up man shed in norton which be national scheme it be remarkable place where man can come together and talk about mental health but they do so by engage in other activity for those who have not be to one man shed be just like your shed it have all the great thing your shed have but your mate be there as well in the man shed in norton you can make model boat or make thing use the printer and it have the most amazing workshop which include fantastic pillar drill it make think that need pillar drill for my workshop to help my mental health meet many man there some be bereaved some be suffer from serious or terminal illness and other be feel lonely they give plenty of tea and we have really good chat really positive and uplifting chat and there be great deal of mickey taking as well which you always find when you get group of man together that sort of facility be incredibly important for all the reason we have hear about in discussion about man mental health not least among those as we have hear number of time this evening be the fact that for man of my age suicide be the most prevalent reason for death we hear that from my hon friend the members for darlington lola mcevoy and for whitehaven and workington josh macalister in my constituency of stockton north man wait more than three month over the national average for treatment for mental health condition as do woman in fact everyone do some form of talking therapy would really help with many condition which be why want to take moment to talk bit about psychotherapy my hon friend mention man shed be delighted to visit the kirkcaldy man shed in my constituency recently to see the amazing work that the people there do listen to this debate have be strike by the positive change that this bill will bring and by the contrast with scotland the people speak to from almost every local service raise the issue of the mental health crisis across fife be they from the nhs charity or the police nhs fife have ask for funding from the scottish government to sort out our mental health crisis and be tell to not even ask that be such contrast with where we be in this place and be sure my hon friend agree that action need to be take in scotland and in fife absolutely agree with my hon friend it will not be very long before voter in scotland have the opportunity to contrast the scottish government with what labour government deliver and hopefully they will chose the latter mention psychotherapy for profession that have be around since the time of freud it be remarkably unregulated there be no professional register no form of legally enforceable complaint and no way to ensure that someone find guilty of misconduct be stop from practise in fact anyone can call themselves therapist in the previous labour government consider some form of regulation for therapist and encourage the government to include such regulation in the bill it would be the ideal place for it since there have be strong increase in private practice and in legal case arise from issue to do with psychotherapy of course there be also online influencer professor dame til wyke an expert in this area describe they as sell snake oil as my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey mention that be another reason why we need strong safeguard and regulation of social medium for child essentially an unqualified psychotherapist could do harm but the issue be more likely to be the miss opportunity to do good perhaps failure to diagnose more serious condition or frankly miss chance to save somebody life regulation be support by the profession chloe professional urge to raise this issue with the secretary of state be do that now as he be in his place this be an opportunity to restore confidence in the profession and for we all to pick up where the last labour government leave off as say half the man in room will run out of it when mental health be mention what be the answer to that graham give the answer put broken lawnmower in the middle of the floor big conversation will ensue and two hour later all the man will know each other name and the name of each other family they have talk about how they be feel and whether they be do okay you probably will not have repaired lawnmower but you will have lot of suggestion there be good reason for that man generally be not good speaking face to face but they can speak shoulder to shoulder be delighted to speak about this new mental health bill it follow up on the mental health act which be as old as our secretary of state as we hear what have hear throughout the debate be that mental health affect we all in some way it touch all of we whether personally or through people we know really well welcome the great protection under the bill especially for people with learn disability also welcome early intervention the stress on out of hospital care and the idea of advance choice people who have repeat psychosis know exactly what they want when they be well when they become ill they can become paranoid about their family and their friend and they be not rational that be one of the reason why sometimes they need to be detain under the mental health act if they have an advance choice document they can at least say what they would like while they be in normal state of mind that be important and look forward to that measure like the fact that police station be be remove as place of safety be concerned about how section and of the mental health act be be use notice that there be some scheme in which mental health worker go out with the police and work together with they and that be crucial close relative of mine become extremely unwell though it be not quite as awful as what happen to the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom first they be sectioned in an department and then no bed could be find for hour for this poor relative of mine the heroic nurse and consultant have to look after someone who be acutely psychotic that simply be not be not tolerable in our system we need to find place quickly for people who be mentally ill and we have to make sure that they get the good treatment so that they can get well quickly while protect the rest of the nhs this close relative of mine be move to bed mile away from her family we must ensure that we get more sufficient bed and more local provision know that will take time and that mental health provision be not in good state but hope that with this legislation and our new labour government we can change that so that people do not have to travel out of area for mental health provision be impress by the idea of crisis hub have work with the stroud crisis team for many year as gp and have always feel that give bit more strength and bit more resource they could keep lot of people out of hospital and from be sectioned but they need that resource they also need close work with consultant psychiatrist one of my constituent wait more than eight hour in mental health crisis for to get back to they in which time their mental health deteriorate previously they access dedicated local support line which give they prompt access to professional support do the hon member agree that prompt access to support in crisis be vital to reduce the need for the great degree of intervention cover by this bill that be certainly true but we need to be careful because part of the issue be the resource for mental health rather than the mental health act we must not blur the two the current government be put mental health worker into the system and be delighted about that hopefully it will prevent the wait for mental health assessment that people be have to put up with want to say something about appropriate medical treatment and therapeutic benefit to which the bill refer some million people in this country be on antidepressant and about of those people be try to get off they the harm that these drug can do include an increase risk of suicide when people be first go on to they and when they be come off they as we have see in couple of recent tragic case they can also cause fairly long term sexual dysfunction be ask the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency to put proper warning on its leaflet and be also ask for special service to help people come off antidepressant because do so be extremely difficult and most gps be not particularly well informed about the good way of do it it have to be do extremely slowly my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister talk about adhd and autism and what should be do about neurodiversity feel that we should be extremely careful in mental health service not to over medicate people with so call neurodiversity and look forward to speak to my hon friend about that have to nip out of the chamber for half an hour early to talk to the head of neurodiversity taskforce which will report in july what think it need to do be bring about much more supportive service rather than go straight for medication which be what seem to happen when people be refer to private psychiatric clinic at present the level of ritalin like substance with which people with adhd be treat have increase by factor of interestingly that increase have occur in social class rather than social class there be something here that we need to get grip on we need to provide proper service for people with adhd be interested by the comment from the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt about family when it come to mental health family be crucial and would like to adapt the bill slightly to make they much more central and responsible the concept of family could be extend to certain other people whom person when well could nominate but family be the crux in lot of psychiatric care their input must be value and they must be involve this be very good bill and it be about time we have it support all its great protection and believe that it will reduce the number of compulsory detainment thank everyone who have take part in the debate from the secretary of state onwards it have be move and inspire to see the house unite on the need for change it have be particularly useful for to benefit from the professional expertise and the personal experience of so many member who have speak my hon friend the member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer my hon friend the members for ashford sojan joseph and for thurrock jen craft and the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom have all educate and move with their experience and knowledge it have long be know that the mental health act be not fit for purpose and pay tribute to all the work that have be do so far include the excellent review undertake by professor sir simon wessely commission by the former member of parliament for maidenhead when she be prime minister know that the intent of the bill both to strengthen the voice of patient and add statutory weight to their right to be involve in the planning for their care and to inform their choice about the treatment that they receive be strongly welcome by member on both side of the house also welcome be the step that the government have take since the election to start to transform mental health service with new funding mention by the secretary of state and the plan to recruit new mental health worker before deal with the substance of the bill may ask the minister whether when he wind up the debate he will be able to provide some reassurance about the future of the patient and carer race equality framework which believe be vital to the achievement of equality of outcome in mental health and which believe would be more effective as part of the bill than simply as guidance know that that be the strongly hold view of many of the expert by experience who have work on pcref one thing know from my time in previous role when help to develop mental health service in lambeth over two decade be that disproportionate number of people from african and caribbean heritage community be detain under the mental health act as have be say by other figure highlight by mind show that rate of detention for black or black british group be over three time those for the rest of the population similarly black or black british group be more than time more likely than white group to be subject to community treatment order in lambeth work with organisation such as black thrive set up by my great former colleague dr jacqui dyer among other to radically change mental health service in south london and elsewhere we show that hear people voice early intervention reduce stigma among african caribbean community and focus on keep people well via work and training provide by membership organisation such as mosaic clubhouse can prevent people from become ill and from tragically come into the mental health system for the first time via the criminal justice system welcome the change in the bill and the commitment from the minister in the other place to improve datum on outcome and on patient experience of community treatment order despite the passing of the mental health units use of force act otherwise know as seni law which be bring forward by my right hon friend the member for streatham and croydon north steve reed the use of force in mental health setting remain too frequent and that must be address as well prevention work and intervention to address mental health need at the early possible stage be critical because if someone face mental health problem when they be young it can hold they back at school damage their potential and leave they with lifelong consequence that be why warmly welcome the work that the government be do to bring vital service into school so that they can intervene early support pupil and help prevent condition from become severe it be really encourage that mental health support team should reach coverage of pupil by the end of this parliament young people in dartford where run well support engagement event last month will absolutely welcome the introduction of young

more openly and responsibly about what support be need for whom and where at the heart of this bill be the most vulnerable people in our society tonight we have debate not how parliament serve the powerful but how it protect the most vulnerable while uphold freedom how it safeguard the public without surrender to fear and how it balance the need for control with the imperative of compassionate care mental incapacity may dim person ability to choose but the law must never let it extinguish their right to matter reform of mental health law must recognise that protect someone from themselves or other be not carte blanche to own their life but simply involve borrow the rein for time to steer the person to recovery and hand they back when agency be restore and they be fully equip to chart

dartford jim dickson talk about the accumulative attention across this house that have lead we here today which be really important we hear that the first mental health act be introduce in but be

independent mental health advocate all aim to increase the support for people at risk of be detain and allow patient who have be detain to be discharge to community if certain condition allow however valid concern be raise and member on both side of the house have agree that more need to change be pleased that the bill build on the work of the previous government who make significant stride in address the long stand disparity between physical and mental health as have be mention former prime minister baroness may commission the independent wessely review into the act too pay tribute to their work in this journey his report build on the principle of choice and autonomy least restriction therapeutic benefit and people as individual the conservative government work to create draft bill which as we hear underwent significant scrutiny we even have member here who be part of it recognise the need to get it right much of the wessely report recommendation be here in front of we tonight build around advance choice document improve advocacy reform of community treatment order and change around autism and learning disability to name some of the recommendation on behalf of his majesty official opposition be pleased to stand here today and say that we support the principle behind the bill we will work constructively with the government to scrutinise and improve it in committee and ensure that we pass good legislation that will do what be intend the minister understand that progress in principle must become progress in practice so would like to jog his memory about some of the question ask by my right hon friend the member for melton and syston edward argar do the minister believe there be enough treatment facility particularly in the community be there adequate place of safety for people be detain once police and prison cell be remove do the mental health tribunal system have capacity to deal with more case and what will happen follow the abolition of nhs england which commission specialist mental health service do he believe in hit the mental health investment standard will he commit to do so go forward to that end will he set out timetable for this house the service and the public to all work towards to be hold account to there be little great moral burden than decide for someone who can not decide for themselves where care end and control begin make no mistake this be what this house be grapple with tonight and throughout the passage of the bill involuntary care should never be the first instinct or answer but resort to prevent harm to both the individual and those around they compassionate care therefore demand precision without precision we simply have sentiment as his majesty opposition we will endeavour to ensure that the government sentiment become commitment it be truly privilege to be in the chamber this evening to hear so many move powerful and thoughtful contribution it really be parliament at its good and it be an honour for to close the debate the bill have be long time come patient practitioner campaigner and charity have all long await the introduction of this legislation and have play hugely important role in get the bill to this point would like to put on record my thank on behalf of the government and pay testament to their commitment to change thank member in both this house and the other place include our brilliant and esteemed colleague baroness merron for all their work as the bill start in the other place it have already be through extensive detailed scrutiny under the eye of peer many of whom be there when the act be last revisit in be sure they will enjoy remind they of that it be testament to the cross party consensus that have so far underpin the bill that the debate be constructive and largely lead to the betterment of the bill trust that this collegiate spirit will now continue in this house and thank the opposition and the liberal democrats for the constructive spirit in their approach to this debate every speech we hear seek to improve process and outcome for patient and their loved one and there be broad cross party support for the overall ambition of the bill however some specific issue and query be raise in the course of the debate that need address many hon member ask about our implementation plan rightly state that legislation be only as good as its application indeed we know that community service provision be very far from where it need to be an issue that we intend to address alongside the implementation of the bill our first priority after royal assent will therefore be to draft and consult on the code of practice it be essential that we listen both to practitioner and to those with experience of the act when we draw up the statutory guidance the review of the mental health act be very welcome it start its life close to my constituency with the work of professor sir simon wessely who draw on the experience of many resident in south east london particularly with regard to his work on racial inequality as the minister be talk about the implementation of the bill wonder whether he can reassure my constituent who want to know that this bill will do the job of eliminate racial inequality from mental health service by commit to put the patient and carer race equality framework on the face of the bill we be already work to reduce inequality under the mental health act the patient and carer race equality framework be now contractual requirement for all provider of nhs commission care it will support trust to improve their interaction with racialise and culturally diverse community and improve governance accountability and leadership on improve experience of care for those community and drive concrete action to reduce racial inequality within mental health service give that our first priority after royal assent will be to draft and consult on the code of practice it be essential that we listen both to practitioner and to those with experience of the act when draw up the statutory guidance that support the act application we will therefore engage with people with live experience their family and carer staff and professional group commissioner provider and other to do this the code will be lay before parliament before final publication alongside the code we will develop secondary legislation that will be lay before parliament subject to the parliamentary process as set out in the legislation we have already publish policy paper that set out more information on some of the delegate power in the bill and provide an early indication of what we intend to set out in regulation we recognise the appetite to deliver after year of delay and the importance of parliamentary scrutiny and accountability in this crucial work we have therefore commit to lay an annual write ministerial statement on progress so that hon member will have ample opportunity to hold we to account for progress make and milestone achieve we have cover wide range of topic and question this evening and will not be able to cover all of they in the time allocate to will therefore limit my comment to two area that have come up repeatedly namely the implementation plan and the treatment of people with autism and learning disability thank the minister for give way he be talk rightly about the importance of the implementation of legislation he will be aware that new measure come into force two month ago under the online safety act which introduce legal power to remove online content that promote suicide ahead of this write to ofcom about platform that be actively promote suicide and suicidal ideation and have be link to the death of almost young people and adult the ofcom chief executive reply to say that ofcom be open an investigation do the minister agree that it need to get on and remove this kind of content across the uk of course we have the online safety act and there be measure within that legislation that address this issue however my hon friend be absolutely right that it be time to crack on and deal with this deeply troubling issue pay tribute to her excellent work and hope she will continue to press ofcom to do the right thing and to do it rapidly we know that implementation will take time as the pre legislative scrutiny committee recognise we estimate that it will take around year to fully implement all bill measure due largely to the time need to train specialised workforce group include second opinion appoint doctor and tribunal judge and the need to ensure that the right community support be available for people with learn disability and autistic people this timeframe necessarily span multiple spending review and multiple parliaments so be limited in the detail can give today about future spend and timeline however we have set out in the impact assessment what we think be require in both time and funding we expect the process of draft and consult on the code of practice to take at least year alongside the code we will develop secondary legislation which will be lay before parliament we have already publish policy paper which contain more information on some of the delegate power in the bill and provide an early indication of what will be set out in regulation we will then need time to train the exist workforce on the new act regulation and code which will likely be in and although we will commence some clause such as on supervised discharge two month after royal assent the first major reform include clause concern ground for detention exclude the change to part for people with learn disability and autistic people and nominate person be expect to follow the training in the timeline for later phase be inevitably less define but we will expand the workforce and improve community support with the aim of implement the reform increase the frequency of mental health tribunal from these timeline be indicative and we will iterate the plan as we get more certainty on future funding and wide workforce plan the other issue that come up lot be the treatment of people with autism and learn disability again implementation should be well plan to ensure that the propose legislative change have the intended effect the propose change to the detention criterion will be commence only when strong community service be in place so that the alternative to hospital care be robust member will understand that robust implementation plan be dependent on the final legislation that be pass and on future funding which be subject to future spending review however local system do not need to wait for legislative change to come into force to begin put in place the necessary community service for people with learn disability and autistic people there be renew funding in within icb baseline to continue improve community support provision for people with learn disability and autistic people we should recognise that the bill be the result of the independent review commission by the now baroness may of maidenhead during her premiership many important contribution have also come from those with live experience of the act and their loved one it take real courage to speak openly about those experience and to channel pain into change as my right hon friend the health secretary say in his opening speech the government have demonstrate their commitment to fund mental health properly and that commitment have be translate into real tangible delivery the million multi year capital investment to improve mental health urgent and emergency care pathway new or expand crisis alternative service nationally include crisis cafés safe haven and crisis house provide an alternative to or psychiatric admission million in capital investment to open new mental health crisis assessment centre which aim to provide accessible and responsive care for individual in mental health crisis and more mental health worker we be also committed to improve early intervention and shift care to the community to support people to live well and thrive we have commit to improve support for young people with young futures hub make support worker more accessible to child we be pilot in england the neighbourhood mental health centre model which build on learn from international exemplar it be privilege to be lead this transformational

be grateful to have the time to debate government community funding and support for local pub we be fortunate to have so many amazing pub in reigate redhill banstead and our village and they be far more than just place to have pint they be the heart and soul of our town and village bring people together and enrich daily life they provide job and sense of community and they even support our local farmer and producer by sell their good sadly we have lose many pub in recent year with ever increase cost and rise taxis push they to closure every loss be feel in the community diminish social cohesion and shrink our local economy pub contribute more than billion to the uk economy in and pay more than billion in tax despite the tight margin they operate on just as many household have struggle with high energy bill and inflation so too have pub which be still feel the residual effect of lockdown during the pandemic and the change in consumer behaviour that come with they they now face increase employer national insurance contribution and business rate on top of everything else commend the hon lady who be quickly make reputation for herself in the house as an assiduous mp whether it be in westminster hall adjournment debate or last friday well do to she every one of her constituent should be proud of all her industrious work here strangford and ards have suffer greatly from the hospitality business downturn to give one example the parlour bar be build in it have be there long time but it be under pressure like romas and other pub in newtownards some of hospitality business plan to reduce employment level risk job loss and impact worker income intend to cancel plan investment and will cut trading hour due to the increase in the minimum wage and national insurance contribution do she agree think everyone in the chamber have the same opinion and we look to the minister for good reply that the government and the minister with the sympathy and compassion he have for business need to step up to ensure that those business survive beyond and perhaps for another year agree with the hon member it be really important that we support our pub we can not continue the approach of squeeze they until the pip squeak we will lose they and once we do we will never get they back from next year the government will be permanently lower business rate for retail and hospitality business do the hon member agree that it would be good if the minister confirm that that permanent lowering will be in relation to rate as they currently be rather than pre covid rate or last year rate thank the hon lady for that contribution would welcome any clarity from the minister about that in redhill we have an amazing pub call the garibaldi which be community pub not for profit pub that give back to the community in so many way on walk in you feel the warmth straightaway from shiv juliette and the other volunteer who be always there to give welcome with smile there be always something go on quiz karaoke bhunny street food even book club my personal favourite be the force fry up for veteran on saturday morning sometimes go along to help serve the tea coffee and toast normally do it quite badly and the music bingo out back there be the community garden which have be transform with the help of the garibaldi gardening group volunteer it be now accessible to everyone include young adult with special need who visit with ymca east surrey every bit of profit the garibaldi make get plough back into thing that benefit the community it be there for the benefit of redhill resident not for any other reason and it be extremely good at what it do that be incredibly clear whenever visit people from all walk of life be sit side by side with friend and neighbour enjoy chat and drink all part of make the garibaldi the special place that it be be sorry to interrupt the hon member flow the garibaldi sound like an amazing pub when she describe how it reinvest its fund it remind of the club in my constituency perhaps club rather than pub be more popular in the north east do she agree that many of the thing she have say about the community importance of pub also apply to club such as the hardwick social club in my constituency thank the hon gentleman for that intervention absolutely those thing apply to club and to any premise where we might listen to live music they apply to so many place will focus on pub but hope that we will have many other debate on all those other thing the garibaldi have stand on mill street for year it have survive two world war multiple recession and two global pandemic it have see redhill transform around it into the modern bustling town it be today but it be now at risk if the fund can not be raise to buy the building rather ironically the pub be so much more than brick and mortar but it need to buy the brick and mortar if it be to survive in previous year the community ownership fund have provide great opportunity for community group to acquire community building it have award more than million to project across the uk include several community pub sadly however the fund be no long available the new government have announce their intention to introduce new right to buy for important community asset this will no doubt bring many benefit and help to preserve value community building and space it will empower community to save much love pub and community hall rather than just have to accept their loss however in order for group to utilise this to the full ask the minister whether they have any plan to introduce fund to support the purchase of valuable community asset by the community the garibaldi be do sterling job of try to raise the money itself as be sure many other group around the country be do but it would be useful to know if there be any likelihood of new funding on the horizon that it could apply for to supplement its effort the garibaldi be such an important part of redhill we can not imagine redhill without it so would be most grateful for any advice and support from the minister on how we can secure it for future generation the hon lady be absolutely right to say that some sort of community ownership fund be require do she agree that the company that own the pub that the community be seek to buy need to look after the property in chardstock the george inn continuity group be try to buy the pub but the wellington pub company be allow water in through the roof which be completely unacceptable do she agree that the pub company that own the pub need to look after they obviously do not know the detail of that specific case but agree that we all have collective responsibility to look after these important community asset before bring my comment to close would like to pay tribute to some other fantastic pub in my constituency have quite lot of they the hon member be talk about the resumption of the community ownership fund for pub would the minister consider other option such as the british business bank and look into how other fund could be use for this purpose too would be interested in the minister response to that question recently run campaign to find out which pub be my constituent favourite with the aim of remind they of the pub on their doorstep and the importance of support their local the response have be phenomenal it be clear that our pub mean lot to local people in reigate redhill banstead and our village and be pleased to say that the result be now in be sure the minister be on the edge of his seat want to know before put he out of his misery want to let he know that he be very welcome indeed as be anyone here this evening to visit for pint the winner of good food and drink pub and good pub garden be the well house inn pub in mugswell that know very well can personally vouch for the delicious burger and have tendency to make sure visit around lunchtime the hon member have give an account of all the

freewheelers blood bikes who provide courier service to deliver blood for the nhs that be all do through volunteer they be have charity event next month where motorcyclist cyclist runner and walker will support the city and celebrate the park the street and the people of wolverhampton do she agree that our pub be not just place where we eat drink and have good time and that they also do lot of
