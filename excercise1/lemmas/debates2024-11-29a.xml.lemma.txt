be sorry but be not go to take any intervention as need to make progress the court must speak to one of the doctor and can hear from anybody else they deem necessary if there be any evidence of coercion the court will not approve the request and if evidence emerge subsequently the court order could be revoke it be also important to note that the person can change their mind at any time with period of reflection build in have consult at the high level in the judiciary and the medical profession know that they can and will fulfil those safeguard responsibility and that they have the expertise to do so let we be clear as my hon friend the member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna say early this be not brand new territory for doctor doctor work in partnership with other clinician be already require to manage complexity in end of life decision making follow the request of the british medical association that doctor should be under no obligation whatsoever to participate but if they do participate they will receive appropriate training and support doctor should be able to use their professional judgment when and if conversation take place take their cue from the patient as they do for many other issue welcome that patient centre approach many doctor feel the change in the law would safeguard clinician and patient by make everything explicit when it come to the detail of what assist dying would look like we have the benefit of draw on the experience of jurisdiction around the world could talk extensively about the international experience of assist dying the health and social care committee report do brilliant job of that and this bill have look at good practice as well as model which and many other would not be comfortable with our have here in england and wales reflect on their experience clinician in australia say through deep and meaningful conversation between doctor patient and their loved one we can dispel fear reduce suffering bring death and die out of the shadow and so allow patient and their family well quality of life and quality of death as one australian member of parliament say we have bring behind close door practice into the open and give die people meaningful transparent choice crucially none of the fear that be put forward as reason not to change the law have be realise the status quo be break and assist die work evidence from around the world show that the option of have an assist death actually lift the fear that terminally ill people have and that many never actually use it but be able to make the good of the time they have leave due to the comfort and reassurance that it provide people talk about slippery slope but the health and social care committee find that not one jurisdiction that have pass law on the basis of terminal illness have expand its scope interruption that be absolutely true as the court here and in europe have repeatedly make clear parliament be sovereign this bill could not be make any broad through any judicial process speak of process with reference to the bill have listen to what know be genuine concern of members about ensure that we get this legislation right commit to the house that if the bill pass second reading today which sincerely hope it do be minded to move motion that give the bill committee the power to take oral and write evidence in order to ensure that thorough approach continue to be take that be not normal procedure for private member bill but think that that be the right thing to do also reassure colleague that the bill committee will meet over number of week mean that there be ample time for full consideration of the detail of the bill include amendment the committee will be representative of the view and make up of the house let be clear that will mean there will be representative of different party with range of view on the committee as the leader of the house say at the dispatch box just yesterday and have say several time the government will of course work with to ensure that the bill be workable and operable that will quite rightly take time and have include in the bill commencement period of up to two year this be not go to happen overnight that timeframe can be explore in committee as it be more important to get this right than to do it quickly in conclusion for the reason have set out be very clear that the law need to change to give terminally ill people choice at the end of life and to protect their love one from fear of prosecution there will be some of we here today who be lucky enough not to have personal experience of this issue but sadly we know that any one of we could end up in this heartbreaking situation we be all live long which be brilliant and have campaign inside and outside parliament for great focus on prevention and early intervention of illness and disease to keep we fit and healthy for as long as possible but any one of we or our loved one could be unfortunate or unlucky enough to receive terminal diagnosis struggle to see how it be fair or just to deny anyone the autonomy dignity and personal choice of take control of their final week and the right to choose do not take away the right not to choose give the choice of an assist death to those who want it would of course not stop anyone who be terminally ill from choose not to make that choice whatever happen today be incredibly proud of the work that my fantastic team and the many campaigner have do on this hugely significant emotional and sensitive subject we need to be clear vote to take this bill forward today be not vote to implement the law tomorrow it be vote to continue the debate it be vote to subject the bill to line by line scrutiny in committee on report and on third reading then of course the bill will go to the lords for what have no doubt will be far robust debate and scrutiny this will be thorough process focus on one of the most significant issue of our time an issue that people across the country clearly want we to address none more so than the many family who be face the brutal and cruel reality of the status quo today be the beginning not the end of that process but the debate can continue only if colleague join in the aye lobby today wholeheartedly encourage they to do so and commend the bill to the house on point of order mr speaker seek your guidance on correct the record say in my speech that have consult with the high level of the judiciary and the medical profession have receive correspondence from the judicial office and wish to clarify my early comment although have speak to lawyer and judge should not have imply that the serve judiciary have in some way indicate their agreement with the bill they have not the serve judiciary have be very clear that they have make no public comment about the bill one way or the other apologise if imply anything to the contrary
