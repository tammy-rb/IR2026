action against the water company rather than just say we work with you action be what my constituent want agree that be why we be increase fourfold the number of inspection so that water company be not mark their own homework it be why we have the plan for water introduce by the former secretary of state my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey and significant additional

government know we grow the very fine seed potato in the far north of scotland they be particularly good because relatively speak they be virus free that be probably because of the northerly latitude where they be grow happen to know that farmer in europe be cry out to get hold of these seed potato ask the government to do everything in their power to ensure that the potato go where they be need and want the hon member make valid point in term of both the quality and the desirability of the product to which he refer the minister for food farming and fisheries be engage actively with the eu on that specific point and be sure that he will update the hon member on it call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee one have only to look over the hedge of eastern england to agree with those who be predict the bad harvest in live memory what assessment have the secretary of state make of the impact that will have on the wide rural economy in particular the availability and price of straw which be vital for the livestock sector and important commodity such as potato which be likely to be under great pressure in term of supply and price this autumn as ever my right hon friend be absolutely on the money in term of the concern regard straw price and low harvest this autumn we be engage extensively with the sector we have the farm to fork summit next week chair by the prime minister that be an indication of how seriously we be take this and how much we be engage with farmer and farm leader it be north east week in the parliamentary canteen and hope all member be take the opportunity to enjoy great north eastern produce however it be always north east week in grainger market in newcastle which try to champion local farmer and produce what be the secretary of state do to support north east farmer in the challenge they face to produce sustainable and affordable food for my constituent face cost of living crisis as the mp for north east cambridgeshire feel should extend north east little wide give that we be big food produce area to the hon lady specific point the minister for farming be engage with that issue and be travel up to the north east this evening as part of that engagement our colleague my hon friend the member for colchester will quince be conduct review of public sector food procurement so that within our public sector we can well procure domestic produce we also have review of label so that we can more clearly label that fantastic produce from the north east to ensure that purchaser can buy it more easily call the shadow minister what be the government do to support farmer quite few people be ask that when one look at the evidence of what be go on the survey this week from the national farmers union into farmer confidence reveal that staggering of farmer be face decline profit or their business will not survive at all their prospect be bad than most tory mp it suddenly seem why be it that farmer do so badly under the conservatives the hon gentleman seem to have write that question before listen to the various example that have just give but let give he one the most successful scheme the department for environment food and rural affairs have ever run be the current sustainable farming incentive scheme with over application more than any other scheme the department have run we have also be flexible in look at how those scheme be deliver give the challenge of the wet weather and will have more to say on that very shortly call the snp spokesperson listen carefully to that answer while brexit have be deeply damaging to farmer all across the united kingdom the action take by the scottish government mean that farmer in scotland have far great protection than those elsewhere on these island the snp government have guarantee scottish farmer the level of funding that be available pre brexit unlike the tories here in england or indeed the labour party in wales that be the snp stand up for farmer in word and deed unlike the westminster party will the secretary of state take this opportunity to apologise to farmer in england for his government betrayal of they refer the hon gentleman to the billion commitment in our manifesto which have be meet in full tree planting what step his department be take to help increase tree planting this government have put in place the most comprehensive regime ever to increase tree planting crucially it be underpin by legislation in the environment act and legally bind target to increase our tree cover to and support and back up by our million nature for climate fund to date million tree have be plant under this government more tree than in any other decade tree must play crucial role if we be to meet our commitment on nature recovery and net zero and they be tremendous source of happiness well being and landscape beauty to meet the ambitious tree plant goal that the government have set can they streamline the permission process some of the red tape seem disproportionate and in need of regulatory reform thank my right hon friend for the work she have do in her constituency to encourage tree planting but she be right that the process need to be fast and simple we have take that on board and the forestry commission have recently introduce the woodland creation fast track aim to help to decide eligible woodland creation offer within just week to inform that scheme it have develop low sensitivity map of the whole country to show people the good place to plant tree or where they could think about plant tree that be not on our good available agricultural land which be important for food lead by the woodland trust tree equity score uk be map base application create to address disparity in urban tree distribution by identify the area in great need of investment in tree what be the department do to promote increase tree cover in the part of the country that need it most highlight again the low sensitivity map which point out exactly the same thing as the map the hon gentleman refer to we have many fund focus in particular on urban area some come from the department for levelling up housing and communities to encourage urban tree planting because it be so important for our health and wellbeing we have whole list of fund available and urge people to look at they and plant tree call the shadow minister have to say that the minister response suggest that the government be completely in denial the office for environmental protection report expose that the government be way off target on their legally bind tree planting target there have be no trend of improvement on tree planting between and it would be bad enough if the problem be lack of money but her department be even fail to spend the money that it have be allocate the environmental land management scheme be underspent by hundred of million and the nature for climate fund that she speak about have return million to the treasury unspent be not it clear that to get the tree cover that our country need we do not need magic money tree we need labour government ask the hon gentleman to look at his own tree planting record this government have plant more tree than labour do we now have the plan in place so if one look at the graph it be ramp up to hit those target and the training skill the forest apprenticeship and the framework be in place to reach our target coastal defences what step his department be take to strengthen coastal defence we be invest approximately billion of our billion flood and coastal risk management investment programme in coastal project they will well protect over property as well as critical infrastructure the environment agency be also run the million government fund coastal transition accelerator programme which be fund coastal authority so they can explore how to well support their community the east anglian coast have take real battering in recent month and project such as the lowestoft flood defence scheme have be delay our region be the most vulnerable to climate change and be lead player in deliver net zero for the uk so will my hon friend consider climate change risk assessment on which regional coast defence strategy can then be prepared to properly protect home business port farmland and infrastructure as well as nurture our unique coastal environment there be no well champion than my hon friend on the challenge of coastal erosion the environment agency be develop new national flood risk assessment and an update coastal erosion risk map to improve how we access flood risk information and communicate it to our community those new dataset and map will include the potential impact of climate change on flood risk and coastal erosion and will help to inform how we well protect home business farmland and infrastructure along our coastal community call the shadow minister we learn from the public accounts committee report that flood defence project have be cancel just like the one in lowestoft whether the minister choose to use the word cancel defer delay or on long list make no difference because he be still refuse to tell we where those project be why do he insist on hold resident in contempt by not tell they the fate of their local flood defence and my official have be review the application that have be put forward and announcement will be come very soon the government be invest billion in flood defence which be more than ever before and we will continue to ensure that we be well protect coastal community catchment partnerships fund how much fund his department plan to provide for catchment partnership in the financial year one hundred catchment base approach partnership be set out in the plan for water the catchment base approach be exactly the right one agree with the decision take by my right hon friend on that and be exactly the approach that we be take in the financial year be allocate to each catchment for that thank my right hon friend for that answer the plan for water be start to work in relation to community partnership next week the east suffolk catchments partnership will publish the plan for the river deben however could encourage my right hon friend to try to accelerate some of those partnership potentially by increase the funding from per partnership to so that every single partnership can have full time employee to really drive this action forward very much agree with my right hon friend what we be do be twofold first we be increase funding she will have see that yesterday we announce an uplift of million for local community lead project to improve river catchment alongside that we be look at some major intervention in catchment such as on the river wye where

target way of take catchment approach sewage have be discharge into our river for million hour include the river thames in my constituency funding be only part of clean up this mess the whole water sector be break and need to be put into special measure so what be the secretary of state long term plan for tackle these issue or be he content to keep follow labour lead and to take up our policy

that we be step up inspection with fourfold increase in inspection we be tackle bonus in company that be guilty of pollution and we be take much tough enforcement action with the big ever prosecution of water firm by the environment agency whole range of action couple with the plan for water be bring additional investment into the sector and take catchment by catchment approach air quality what

government decision to introduce short term pause in the determination of application for environmental permit for certain type of waste incineration facility will the minister please now extend that pause beyond its current official end date of may and include exist incinerator that have apply to increase their capacity be grateful for my hon friend question our assessment of incineration capacity and need be ongoing do not want to prejudge the outcome of that work or any of the next step but the government be clear that propose waste incineration facility must not result in overcapacity or compromise our ambition to minimise waste and improve recycling last month my local authority of richmond upon thames along with other council be inform by defra that its local air quality grant of million which have be award just two month early be be rescind give the number of area in twickenham breach air quality standard include area close to school and with world health organisation target become ever more stringent how do the minister think he be meet his commitment to expand the resource available to council to improve air quality be grateful for the hon lady question which give we the opportunity to highlight the great progress we be make in this area we want to continue to make progress and support local authority but we do have concern that the local air quality scheme be not deliver the most positive outcome and some of the bid that be come forward be not aim at improve air quality we have bid for robotic chatbot and for kinetic art project we want to focus on improve air quality and make sure we be fund local authority to do just that serious dog injuries register dog groomers if he will take step to implement dog groomer charter mark that include register of serious injury for dog under the animal welfare act groomer must protect dog under their control from harm and provide for their welfare need where that act be breach offender face

permanent scarring unfortunately that be not an isolated case be aware that as the minister say the animal welfare act provide some framework in relation to intentional harm but be amazed at the lack of regulation in the industry will the minister make an assessment of what further legislative step can be take to regulate the dog groom industry and ensure the safety of all dog be grateful to my hon friend for raise this case and obviously sympathise with his constituent whose pet suffer that poor practice the government belief in the importance of animal welfare underpin the strong protection include in the animal welfare act and we will take step to address widespread welfare issue where they arise waste incineration plant capacity what assessment he have make of the adequacy of operational and consent waste incineration plant capacity official be currently assess plan residual waste treatment capacity include incineration against expected future residual waste arise in england so that we can understand our future capacity need follow the implementation of key commitment in the resource and waste strategy this capacity assessment will be publish in due course my north west norfolk constituent welcome the moratorium on new waste incinerator and the review but give that the incinerator already operate and those with consent provide enough capacity as we meet legally bind target to halve residual waste may urge the minister to make that temporary pause permanent so that we do not have to have an unnecessary and unwanted incinerator in wisbech defra official be currently scope the need for review of the role of waste incineration facility and do not want to prejudge the conclusion of that exercise the current pause period will end on may and the next step will be announce no later than that date animal welfare what step his department be take to help improve animal welfare this government remain absolutely committed to implement our action

be take to support local authority to tackle fly tipping nationally fly tipping on public land have fall for the second year in row with enforcement action up by but we all know the huge detrimental impact that fly tipping can have on our community fly tip fine have more than double and we be now expect local authority to reinvest that income in enforcement and clean up our street we be go far with reform on how waste carrier be regulate with the introduction of digital waste tracking to help local authority continue to crack down on waste crime thank my hon friend for his answer what landowner and the public want be for this to stop realise that we have double the fine we have massively increase they again but may suggest that all case should be prosecute and that prosecution should be publicise widely both to reassure victim and to deter perpetrator could not agree more promote the conviction absolutely reassure victim that the government and local authority be take tough action know that my hon friend have particular concern about what be happen across the countryside and defra be fund the national rural crime unit to explore the police role in tackle fly tipping and

constituent who be get involve in help he topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility since last update the house we have remain focused on deliver our plan to improve food security on improve our water quality and on lead the way both at home and abroad in protect the environment that be why we be introduce legislation to ban the supply and sale of wet wipe

reinveste in water restoration scheme we be work on dartmoor to implement the very good recommendation set out in david fursdon report and we have see over farmer now sign up to the sustainable farming incentive make it the most popular scheme ever alongside that we be work at the on bluetongue virus and in many other respect but can see mr speaker that you want to speed up my reply want to get your colleague in call thérèse coffey the environment act be landmark legislation and we of course need to think not only locally but globally one element of that legislation be the introduction of forest risk commodity regulation would be grateful if my right hon friend say what more we can do through our global supply chain measure my right hon friend be right to focus on forest risk commodity our flagship announcement at be that we be take lead action on that many who have watch nature documentary for example on the orangutan can see how important that be to particular specie hope to table legislation on that later this month but my right hon friend be right to focus on its importance call the shadow secretary of state the environmental regulator have today condemn the disgusting state of our waterway cause by the conservatives let water company pump they full of raw sewage this have to stop so will the government now back labour plan and make water boss personally criminally liable so that if they keep illegally dump sewage they end up in the dock we already have the big ever prosecution by the environment agency which be already live we have also already ban bonus for those company guilty of serious pollution we be quadruple the number of inspection as part of that tough enforcement scheme we be also bring record investment into the water industry the hon gentleman never comment on the quality of water in wales but perhaps he will want to address that in his follow up question we will try lincolnshire call sir edward leigh in response to my early question the secretary of state say that food security be of urgent national concern have any agriculture minister ever meet farmer who have deny that land be just as good for grow arable crop as land my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries be extremely well place to speak about the quality of land and how it pay give that he himself farm we recognise that this be part of wide debate about the clustering of solar site on land we also recognise the importance of food security my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh can see the shift in focus to our environmental scheme that align with food security because believe that food security be instrumental to our national security and that also affect our land use an environment food and rural affairs committee report publish last year recommend that we support the request of the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food to undertake country visit to the uk before the end of the government initially indicate that they would facilitate that but the minister late correspondence to state that it will not be feasible to invite the special rapporteur this year why be that not feasible before the general election the un be ready and wait be happy to look at the specific issue that the hon gentleman raise in relation to the un but we be clear about the importance of food production food security and back our farmer it be leave wing council around the country that be ban meat and act contrary to the interest of many of our farmer what can be do to improve compensation payment for cattle farmer follow tb outbreak we be constantly work with those farmer face the misery of tb outbreak be aware of an outbreak in my hon friend constituency in leicestershire which be very painful for the individual farmer concern that be why we must throw everything we can at this terrible disease every tool in the toolbox to try to stop tb spread across england be so old that grow up in land without plastic well britain wrap in brown paper and string last year our household on this small island handle million tonne of plastic it be indestructible it can not be burn and we can not get rid of it will the minister support the global plastic treaty campaign for by greenpeace and other this government be take action on plastic let give the hon gentleman specific example there have be reduction in the use of plastic bag as result of measure that this government have introduce if he look at the communiqué from the in turin he will see that the government be support action on plastic build on the work announce from ottawa last week many community in my constituency face the double whammy of coastal tidal flooding and fluvial river flooding we have see significant investment in place such as par and st blazey through the starr project st austell bay resilient regeneration which the minister have be to see we have recently complete flood defence at pentewan but the village of mawgan porth remain vulnerable to both river and coastal flooding and can not get any real progress in develop scheme to reduce flood risk there will the minister meet to look at what we can do to protect mawgan porth have be to cornwall to meet my hon friend and see the starr project for myself be more than happy to meet to discuss what more we can do because know that he and his colleague on the local council be champion this scheme as much as they can and be more than happy to help the sun may be shin today but it have be long cold wet spring for our farmer give the prediction that of crop will be lose what assessment have the secretary of state make of the number of farming business that will reluctantly stop produce food how will he ensure that the farmer flood fund reach all the farmer who desperately need it the hon lady raise an extremely valid point and it be share concern across the house everyone can see the impact of the wet weather that be why we be continually engage with the sector we have the farm to fork summit as part of that engagement and we be look at what easement can be grant in scheme such as the sustainable farming incentive but also more widely will have more to say on that shortly southport have see million of pound of investment into drainage capacity for water but unfortunately the village of tarleton hesketh bank and banks have not these farming community have be devastate by flood the minister for food farming and fisheries meet and my hon friend the member for south ribble katherine fletcher last year which be appreciate by farmer but more need to be do report have be submit to the department we want to set up an internal drainage board what more can be do to make sure that be do at pace to help these community as touch on early be huge supporter of the work of our internal drainage board they do superb job which be why the minister for water and rural growth my hon friend the member for keighley robbie moore decide to allocate an additional million we will look constructively at what more can be do in more area through the focus of drainage board my hon friend will have see that we have already flex our regulation in response to storm henk for example and we be look at what further thing we can do brexit have be disaster for farmer across the united kingdom but at least in scotland they have the certainty of funding go out beyond unlike in labour run wales and tory run england what step will the government take to provide the same level of surety for english farmer that the snp have deliver for scotland farmer as former chief secretary to the treasury think the suggestion that the way the snp allocate its barnett consequential give farmer fund certainty be somewhat bold claim the point with brexit be that we can tailor our response to the need of our farmer whether through specific legislation such as that on gene edit to develop disease and drought resistant crop our procurement legislation so that we well leverage our public sector procurement and our labelling legislation so that we can support british producer as well as through scheme such as the sfi which be the most popular ever run by defra with more than farmer now sign up in the past flood from the lady brook and micker brook which run through bramhall cheadle hulme and cheadle to join the river mersey have cause devastation to home and family do my hon friend agree that joint work across the region be part of the solution will he continue his support for the upper mersey catchment partnership work my hon friend have raise that specific case with before be more than happy to meet she to have those conversation at speed because know just how valuable project such as flood alleviation scheme be to her constituent in well protect more home north west leicestershire have benefit enormously from be the heart of the national forest with million of tree plant over the past year much of which be on degraded former colliery land as desirable as tree planting be that must be balance against food security do the minister agree that good agricultural land must be protect to produce good food must first commend the national forest for all that it have achieve many farmer be involve in that forest too that be why the forestry commission map show the good place for tree planting be so important and that be not on what we call well available land for which we have specify that the main priority be food production attorney general the attorney general be ask violence against women and girl prosecution rate what step she be take to help increase prosecution rate for violence against woman and girl what step she be take to increase prosecution rate for case relate to violence against woman and girl tackle violence against woman and girl be priority for the government recently visit cps thames and chiltern to hear specifically about the work it be do to combat stalk also hear how the domestic abuse joint justice plan will transform how we investigate this all too frequent crime datum from the crown prosecution service show that despite an increase in the number of referral from the police for domestic abuse both charge rate and prosecution have decrease in the last quarter in bath the southside project voices and somerset and avon rape and sexual abuse support all support those affect by domestic abuse and sexual violence but we can not rely on charity to do the heavy lifting do the attorney general agree that if we want the public to have confidence in the system increase reporting should lead to increase number of prosecution yes it be always difficult to talk with pleasure about increase number of prosecution because all the survivor of those act have go through horrible event for prosecution to take place but agree with the hon lady that it be generally good sign that prosecution number be go up be pleased to say that they be go up in her area for adult rape case there be more to do on domestic abuse case which be why we be focus specifically on the domestic abuse joint justice plan the work of the charity in her region which should say be fund by but independent of government that be what survivor prefer will really help we to ensure that those survivor get justice the attorney general will know that the online safety act be give royal assent at the end of last year and that in that act there be various bit of legislation to protect woman and girl in relation to cyber flashing deepfake and revenge porn will she set out for the house how many prosecution have take place under that new important piece of legislation that be try to protect more woman and girl from those other form of violence be afraid that do not have to hand specific figure for the hon gentleman constituency under that act but be happy to get they for he we be confident that it will be possible to bring prosecution under the act these be important and distressing but relatively new crime and it be important that we continue to work with the police and the cps to prosecute novel area of criminal activity it be really difficult for survivor of these crime to deal with they call the chair of the justice committee the attorney general rightly refer to the work do in relation to domestic violence the most serious offence of violence against woman and girl be rape and serious sexual offence as she will know there be concern that once victim have come forward there be delay in their case be hear largely because of the difficulty in get suitably experience barrister to prosecute they do she accept that one of the main driver of that be the fact that legal aid fee be increase for defence barrister but prosecution fee have lag behind there be gap of around in the brief fee between prosecute and defend do she agree that we must plug that gap urgently to get suitable counsel prosecute as well as defend those case the chair of the select committee be tempt to step on the firm territory of the lord chancellor as he well know he also know because he and have discuss this many time that the lord chancellor and speak several time week about our concern about the shortage of counsel in the criminal sphere in particular however would say gently to my hon and learn friend that do not think money be the only reason why it be not always attractive to prosecute rasso case after rasso case they be drain case to be involve in and they be list very tightly at the moment because of the pandemic backlog as he mention that lead to tension with listing and with the judiciary which can make it very difficult to do this area of work relentlessly have nothing but praise for the barrister who be engage in it crown prosecution service and police services joint working what recent step she have take to increase joint working between the crown prosecution service and police service close and collaborative work across the criminal justice system be key to secure justice for victim hold offender to account and keep the public safe the police and the cps have invest heavily in new way of working include through the national operating model for rape prosecution with the result that the police and the cps work more closely together at an early stage in prosecution during recent visit to greater manchester police divisional headquarters in stockport hear that there can be significant delay between send case to the cps and receive charge decision back to solve that it be suggest that have cps staff base inside the station would speed up the process and improve communication what consideration have my hon and learn friend give to cps presence in police station and will he work with and stockport division to facilitate trial thank my hon friend for raise this extremely pertinent point she be right to emphasise the importance of early co operation between the police and the cps at visit last month to charing cross police station consider precisely that point there be buddy system there with cps lawyer work with police officer which be improve case file quality we be actively explore how to ensure close early work with the cps and the police and will look at stockport with she the united kingdom government be go above and beyond to ensure that british arm be readily available in israel arsenal to bomb gaza the attorney general be refuse to give out the legal advice base on the stand law officer convention yet the circumstance for up to million people be now between life and death what step be she take to ensure that britain be not complicit in the destruction of nation and its people can assure the hon gentleman that the attorney general keep all these matter under close review and will ensure that any legal advice be properly obtain and act upon royal albert hall governance if she will refer the governance of the royal albert hall to the first tier tribunal charity the royal albert hall be one of our most important cultural institution there be long stand difference between the trustee of the hall and the charity commissioner over governance matter really hope that the party will work together to resolve their difference without expensive litigation and stand absolutely ready to facilitate those discussion the attorney general in she must say excellent recent letter on the matter express her disappointment that the royal albert hall bill be not more ambitious and that the constitution of the corporation of the hall of arts and sciences give rise to potential conflict between the private interest of seat hold trustee and the corporation charitable object totally agree she have say that she will look at this issue but unlike her predecessor will she please also consider if she need to refer the matter to the charity tribunal so it can be settle once and for all ticket to attend one of our country most famous and treasured venue should not be turn up on notorious ticket website like viagogo and those who be receive ill get gain should not be run the charity the hon lady take very close interest in these matter and be believe the chair of the all party parliamentary group on ticket abuse really commend she for her work in this important area many of we who be great supporter of the albert hall be concern by ticket cost be hopeful as say that the two party can continue to work together want to avoid expensive litigation if that can be do previous attorney general be ask permission to refer the matter to the first tier tribunal have not be

and be sure that member in all part of the house would agree on that point it be absolutely vital that we push back against the grow trend of increase antisemitism think that speak for most if not all hon member when say that we be supportive of any measure that will do that have always say that the conservatives make mistake in overlook the right hon lady and she have show that again today in that regard can she help with what think be narrow but important problem both front bench team support the continuation of arm sale to israel but the great majority of back benchers even on the conservative side would like the opportunity to vote otherwise that have be stop stymie in the past hope that she can find way for the house to freely express its attitude to this question the government and the labour front benchers might get rude awakening and big surprise thank the hon gentleman for his concern but have not be overlook be leader of the house of commons the hon gentleman have find the answer to his own question he have just be able to freely express his view on this matter as he know there be strict rule regard our arm export which be also scrutinise by select

devon district council my right hon friend will no doubt fall off her chair so long as she do not defect the main thing be that it have be force to release the information on rivers development have

scrutiny committee have do runner literally do runner and refuse to take part as my right hon friend the member for bournemouth east mr ellwood say local government be not get it right we need time in

what she have be through will ensure that both the lord chancellor and the secretary of state for transport have hear the request for an update on this important matter sme finance treasury committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement the chair of the treasury committee the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin will speak for up to minute during which time no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement emphasise that we want brief question not speech and that those question should be direct to the committee chair not the relevant minister thank you madam deputy speaker for grant this wonderful opportunity to present the report that the treasury committee publish yesterday on access to finance for small and medium sized business as every member will know small and medium sized enterprise form the backbone of the uk economy all of we in our constituency will be aware of amazing small and medium sized business in fact of the business in this country be small and medium sized which give we an idea of how important they be well over half of our constituent who be employ work for sme access to finance for small and medium sized business which the committee have be look at be therefore really important issue want to highlight some of the point raise in our report this be an opportunity not only for member to hear those point but hope for the minister to take they on board no one can deny that with the pandemic and the energy price crisis the past five year have be an absolutely torrid time for everyone sme have often be at the forefront and have experience the brunt of those crisis but without the huge resource that large business have to be able to cope through those crisis the government take extraordinary step to provide support in term of access to finance for small and medium sized business but we be now in different environment in fact all the evidence and datum publish this week show that small and medium sized business be begin to feel much great confidence we be see some real improvement there nevertheless issue remain from that difficult time and also more structurally follow financial regulation measure set up since the banking crash in want to flag up few of the point that we make in our report the first concern the business banking resolution service which be set up after the banking crisis and be design to provide access to resolution mediation and outcome for business that be too large to access the financial ombudsman service but have nevertheless be treat pretty badly during the financial crisis think it fair to say that the committee form the view that the business banking resolution service have not be success it be own and run by the bank which raise question about conflict of interest in the first place or certainly the perception of conflict of interest moreover it have spend about million during its lifetime and have award only million worth of compensation because it draw the access criterion so tightly that very few business be able to qualify as result there be very unsatisfactory outcome for business that use the resolution service because they could not access the financial ombudsman service and the committee agree that it should close as plan we look to the government to come up with consultation on new mechanism by the end of this calendar year secondly there be government initiative call the british business bank the committee think highly of what it hear in evidence from bbb and welcome the announcement in the budget that the covid recovery loan scheme have be rebrande as the growth guarantee scheme we expect that to be an important source of credit to help small business to grow when they would otherwise have struggle however we note that very few small business even know about this organisation and we have try to publicise it through the report we urge the government to assess the effectiveness of bbb every year because we think it have an important role to play and it be pretty successful where it be know about but it be not widely know about thirdly we be greatly concern by what we hear in the evidence about something that sound very niche but be actually very important it be know in the trade as basel after the financial crisis committee set up in basel the swiss city where the central bank of central bank be locate come up with some proposal which be then know as basel iii the prudential regulation authority part of the alphabet soup of financial regulation that be set up after the crash be currently consult on tightening of the criterion for lend to small and medium sized business at present there be discount factor relate to the risk to bank balance sheet from lend to such business but the pra want to tighten that arrangement considerably the committee be concerned because accord to the evidence that we hear such move could withdraw about billion of lend to business from the uk economy we therefore urge the pra not to proceed particularly because we also hear evidence that the proposal would not be implement in the united states or in the european union in fact for many year when we be member of the eu we do not implement what the basel committee be recommend the committee then issue statement express concern and say that we be in violation of its recommendation that show that it be perfectly possible not to implement they all you will get be reprimand we have therefore conclude that the support factor for small and medium sized business should not be change at this stage in the economic cycle fourth issue that come up in the evidence we receive and which have really shock the committee be the extent to which bank be simply close the bank account of business across the country expect that every member of this house will have have piece of casework that involve one of the business in their constituency be tell that its bank account be close with absolutely no reason or notice give by the bank we ask the bank about this issue and they confess that they have close over business bank account during the course of obviously there can be perfectly good reason for do that there will be business that do not reply to any question from their bank and there will be business that be suspect of money laundering or that have actually be find to have do so however we also find that bank can use phrase such as risk appetite or reputational risk to close the bank account of organisation and business that we would think be perfectly fair part of the fabric of this country for example amusement arcade and pawnbroker can struggle to get access to bank account perhaps most alarmingly we hear in one of our evidence session with bank that even someone in the defence sector can have their bank account closed or struggle to open one this be often to do with the holder of bank want to observe the environmental social and governance rule we all think that such rule be good but they can lead to some unintended and inadvertent consequence whereby defence company be effectively debanke and can not get access to bank account in this country be sure that all member present will recognise that the defence of this country be foundation for esg compliance and should not therefore lead to people struggle to get bank account we urgently request that the treasury introduce the legislation on debanke that it have promise and we look forward to that happen before the end of july it be something that we be keen to see see that my minute be up thank everyone for their attention and hope my statement have provide food for thought for member across the house be on the treasury committee and commend my hon friend for her great chairmanship she have already mention the need for transparency and be delighted that the treasury will bring that forward but be particularly strike by how difficult it be to open account even for farmer it can take multiple month most importantly of all the pra approach be go to choke the growth of many small business and we need our small business to become much big for the prosperity of our country do my hon friend agree that the pra really need to understand the importance of this issue to ensure that the entire country prosper which will only happen if small business prosper agree with my right hon friend inflation be the bad tax on our economy and important step be be take by the independent bank of england to raise interest rate to make sure that inflation get back to its target zone that all seem to be on track monetary policy have be tighten already and we see that in the environment in which our small and medium sized business be work they have be squeeze by high interest rate and the evidence we receive show that the acceptance rate for credit have fall from to so it do not feel like the right time to be tighten access to finance for small and medium sized business through change in regulation it particularly do not feel like the right time to be do so unilaterally when the eu and the us be not follow the basel rule be also member of the treasury committee and thank the chair for all her hard work on this report on the overall question of the confidence of sme in their ability to access finance the report raise some interesting figure there be billion finance gap in large high street bank lending to sme between and alongside the soft pressure of sme fear rejection in lending and the lack of trust in the lender themselves will the chair please provide an assessment of how she feel that appetite look across the rest of this year and beyond what tool be at our disposal to deal with the inherent caution in the sme lending market thank my excellent colleague for his question he be absolutely right that the inquiry receive evidence on what would describe as financial apathy small business sometimes choose not to borrow choose not to grow in fact only of small business that seek lending would even consider shop around to find another provider if they be reject by their main bank there be work to do to encourage and guide sme and the british business bank have very important role it be not well enough know which be probably hold back the growth of many excellent small business be so proud that our committee have be able to champion this be grateful to the chair of the treasury committee for make this statement today she will be aware that one of the main reason why lot of small business have to rely on bank funding be because big business do not pay their bill on time and all too often do not pay their bill at all lot of small business in my constituency particularly in construction relate work tell that they sometimes have to wait six month or more to get pay that increase the risk factor for bank because it be much more likely that the small business will fail have the committee look at the problem or do it intend to do so where small business particularly in the construction sector be not pay for their work the hon gentleman make an excellent point that everyone in this house will recognise as challenge get pay by big business be bane of the life of many small business owner know there have be lot of work in the department for business and trade and the government need to lead by example by promptly pay for service the committee hear evidence that small business continue to be frustrate by this thank the chair of the treasury committee for her statement and for answer question backbench business miners and mining communities beg to move that this house have consider miner and mining community thank my good hon

the industrial revolution sustain we through two world war and enable the growth of new sector in finance and the city there be no doubt about it this country this nation owe the mining community debt of honour and gratitude one that be yet to be repay be pleased to make brief intervention in this debate the hon gentleman may not know that be vice chair of the all party group on coalfield community

be generous in his remark and we appreciate it the last pit in my constituency easington colliery close in at time when coal provide of the uk electricity production the decision at the time to close the british coal industry make our country dependent on import coal which until still account for of energy generation coalfield community have never fully recover from de industrialisation as be prove in the new state of the coalfields report publish by sheffield hallam university and the coalfields regeneration trust in response to the hon member for stone sir william cash the all party group continue to take up cause and issue ably chair by my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones the government continue to undermine the local economy as evidence in the excellent report despite the regular trumpeting of level up policy in reality the conservative party choose to invest levelling up funding in place like richmond and cheltenham rather than in place like horden in my constituency which be in the top of the most deprived area in the country level up offer hope but the ready to go horden masterplan for regeneration be sideline by lead coalition from durham county council that favour single bid from bishop auckland constituency represent by conservative mp and former minister in the department for levelling up housing and communities the government have ignore and neglect our most deprived mining community far from level up conservative ministers have widen economic inequality do my hon friend agree that the problem with the levelling up agenda the government be pursue be that it be mainly about capital investment although that investment be desperately need in coalfield area durham county council have also lose million from its grant so the service that our constituent rely on have be devastate over the past year be grateful to my right hon friend for his intervention be go to talk about the levelling up bidding round he and other hon member be well aware of the cost that be incur by the county million in prepare bid that be not approve by the government we should have means base system it should not be beauty contest those community include the mining community that be among the most deprived and urgently need regeneration should be prioritise unfortunately that be not happen the evidence be quite clear and be lay out in the state of the coalfields report know other hon member will mention that so will not dwell on that point coalfield community undoubtedly face numerous challenge lack of job opportunity limited public investment and high council taxis we could have separate debate about the flawed council tax that penalise area with relatively low property value like mine and those of my right hon and hon friend demand on social service be increase in coalfield community because of an age population many of whom have health legacy associate with work in pit and heavy industry and generally have low disposable income under these condition local economy struggle to thrive lack sufficient income to support vital small business and employment opportunity low wealth coincide with low wage make my region the north east the low pay in the country the government could alleviate this in part by address past injustice and ensure retirement security for worker and their widow by reform the mineworker pension scheme in line with the business energy and industrial strategy committee recommendation publish april legacy of mining be industrial disease cut life short include those of my own father and grandfather who be both coalminer who pass away in their before reach retirement age my father die in the belief that his pit pension would provide security for my age mother who happen to be celebrate her birthday on sunday hon member hooray we know that some pensioner receive as little as week from the mineworker pension scheme our miner create the wealth that make this country great with the mineworker pension scheme be among the uk large pension fund however money that should be use to provide security in retirement be be siphon off by the treasury take half of all the pension fund surplus in parliamentary response to in december ministers confirm that they have take billion billion not million as be report on the tv last night out of the pension scheme note also that this figure have not be adjust for inflation so can the minister tell what the figure would be if it be adjust for inflation this money should be use to enhance pension not only provide extra security in retirement but support our local economy coalfield community employment and small business the vast majority of retire miner and their widow continue to live in our coalfield community the moral case for reform be strengthen by an unfulfilled promise of disgrace former prime minister must remind member particularly those on the conservative benches of the promise make by boris johnson when address miner in mansfield and ashfield during the general election campaign once again he deceive voter fail to fulfil his promise on the surplus sharing arrangement which remain grossly unjust the government and the minister have the opportunity to put that right today commend my colleague in the shadow cabinet especially my hon friend the member for bristol north west darren jones the shadow chief secretary to the treasury who chair the then business enterprise and industrial strategy committee which provide blueprint for reform the select committee report on the worker pension scheme offer road map for retain the crown guarantee release the billion in the investment reserve fund return the surplus and protect the taxpayer with key member such as my hon friend the members for blaydon liz twist for bristol north west for barnsley east stephanie peacock and my right hon friend the member for doncaster north likely to hold crucial position in future labour government be confident that we can achieve pension justice for retire miner and their widow in our coalfield community urge those on my own front bench to provide clear commitment on this issue at the early opportunity finally want to mention my constituent ray patterson who sadly pass away last year age just he be one of the people arrest and one of sack during the miner strike his life be change forever by his imprisonment on the ancient charge of unlawful assembly law that can trace its origin back to after the strike the government abolish unlawful assembly and introduce the public order act ray be innocent and at any other time he would not have be arrest charge or convict be during the miner strike and see how the conservative government try to starve worker and their family into submission see police state on the street of east durham intent on crush miner fight to protect their job and community the government court police and national medium be part of criminal conspiracy against work people in coalfield community ray who be imprison and lose his job and pension spend the rest of his life rebuild he leave we too early but his legacy will live on through his family ray maintain his innocence and fight to exonerate himself be sorry ray that we could not deliver justice in your lifetime we need the truth while scotland have take step with the miners strike pardons scotland act england and wales lag behind the policing of the strike be notorious mark by perjury and fabricated evidence which be willingly accept in the government war on the miner four decade later it be imperative that ministers commit to uncover the truth about the strike particularly event in relation to orgreave many conviction from the strike be unsafe warrant the erasure of criminal record with only few exception from orgreave to hillsborough pattern of criminal misconduct in public office emerge with south yorkshire police at its centre coalfield community face numerous challenge in achieve justice and economic growth we require government commit to level up fair taxation and justice despite slogan such as big society northern powerhouse and level up the conservative party have fail to deliver tangible intervention particularly in the area of great need such as horden easington peterlee murton blackhall south hetton haswell shotton and seaham resident in these community have little hope of opportunity and change under the conservative government so those on the labour front bench must address this challenge by bring investment growth and opportunity to these former mining community which be in need of real alternative thank all member who have take the time to attend this debate today particularly thank the hon member for easington grahame morris my hon friend who co sponsor this very important debate with represent my hometown of leigh in parliament and be the anniversary of leigh be grant its town charter in by queen victoria there be so many mine in leigh and the surround community that the area be know in the century as coalopolis gradually from the onwards the mine begin to close with the last one close in the early live very close to bickershaw colliery just over the boundary from my own village of lowton in leigh over plank lane bridge my great grandfather work down that mine with his brother who be the fire safety officer there be some very frightening story of mining disaster back in the day and be sure all those from similar mining community could tell similar tale there be many legacy issue in mining community such as ours they include contaminate land and the recovery of land that be cover by slag heap as well as the economic problem that we see as de industrialisation take place leigh be home not only to large number of mine but to cotton mill which disappear generation early be proud to say that today unemployment in leigh be pretty close to the national average as leigh be situate halfway between liverpool and manchester we be gradually transition from former mining community to commuter community hope that one day leigh can be as wealthy as stockport or trafford certainly that be an ambition to which everyone in my home community can aspire wish to talk about some of the thing that we have be do since be elect as the member of parliament first leigh have have million for new community diagnostic centre and operating theatre at leigh infirmary historically people from leigh have have to go to wigan which might not seem far away but it can take minute to get there through heavy traffic so it be important that our town have full facility at the infirmary we receive million from the levelling up fund to refurbish leigh market the town square and shop front on bradshawgate hopefully that work will begin soon we have furth million to regenerate railway road where my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale david morris use to have his hairdresser shop back in the day although as member can tell it be while since have need his service we have also receive million over year from the future town fund for further regeneration project in leigh that be million that the government be put into the regeneration of leigh and be very proud to have play my part in help to secure that funding however that be not the only funding that the constituency be get that be just some of the funding for the main town of leigh itself which be only about half the constituency the surround former mining community also make up about of the constituency it may surprise member to some degree it surprise that the mayor of greater manchester andy burnham and be wait on final approval for golborne station reopen for which the government have already provide million from the transform city fund if we be successful and truly hope that we be this will be the first time since the that the constituency have have railway station hope that it will prove to be the template for future station serve the town of leigh itself andy burnham and have not always see eye to eye but be proud that we have be able to put party politic aside and work together on that project really hope that the department for transport will approve it have my finger cross there be also successful bid for million for the tyldesley heritage action zone the first community lead regeneration project of its kind in the country thank ian tomlinson and the for tyldesley community interest company for the great work that they be do to regenerate elliott street the high street in tyldesley finally be work on bid with transport for greater manchester to secure million of transport funding from the cancel project to complete the atherleigh way bypass to deal with the congestion that have be blight leigh atherton and my home village of lowton for over year that be million secure for the former mining community in my constituency and million more that we be fight for under this conservative government be proud that we have finally see some money come to our town as many people will say include former member for my seat we have often feel like forget part of the north west of england and forget corner of the borough of wigan be proud to say that that be start to change be very proud to have serve my constituency for nearly five year as the local mp but have couple of request of the minister first leigh could have secure another million from the levelling up fund but wigan council refuse to bid for the full million available the hon member for easington say that he face similar problem with the levelling up fund bid we have to find well model for future round of level up funding because council can not be the arbiter of the funding we get every constituency have the right to the same amount of money and it be important that everyone get the million they be eligible for well model need to be find for allocate future funding and put in bid some colleague have say that they have million in the pot wait but their local authority have simply refuse to bid for it that be not good especially when the mining community that we represent be so in need of that money give the historical issue and problem that they face feel bit disturbed by the line that the hon member be go down my local authority have try to make bid in each of the different round one time we be tell that we be not allow to do so because we have receive in previous round then we be tell that we should apply in the next round which do not even come into existence we have be lead merry dance in my local authority as my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris say local authority staff have waste hour and thousand of pound complete completely nugatory exercise the government should be ashamed of this process have some sympathy with the hon gentleman we be look down opposite end of the kaleidoscope his council have want to put forward bid and not get they my council first come up with bid to spend million on multi storey car park which be completely unacceptable then it bid for half the money think the one thing that we can both agree on be that the initial model for the levelling up fund bore considerable room for improvement that need to be address which be why be raise it with the minister it be cross party concern and be happy to say that in this chamber finally the hon member for easington raise the miner pension fund urge the minister to take back to colleague in cabinet the issue that will doubtless be raise by voice across the chamber it be matter of justice that miner get back the surplus from their pension fund it be their money they pay it into the system we promise they that we would resolve this and we should it be only just with that shall sit down for have say my piece welcome contribution from other member know that you can not take part in today debate madam deputy speaker but you have strong connection with miner and coalfield community and your presence in the chair should be recognise be pleased to speak in this debate as former chair of the all party parliamentary group on coalfield community as patron of the workers memorial charity in st helens and as the mp for very proud lancashire mining community be bear in the summer of know that there will be disbelief at that give my youthful visage and disposition be positively jurassic compare with our new kid on the block my hon friend the member for selby and ainsty keir mather as approach my own landmark this year like many other have be watch and listen to the excellent documentary podcast and reflection on the anniversary of the miner strike as someone relatively au fait with the history of that period which some of my esteemed colleague live through pay tribute to my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris for secure today debate and the work that he do be frankly surprise by how surprised be by the revelation contain in much of the testimony provide by those involve be not naive about the excess of the state and its abuse of power it have life and death consequence every day where grow up but have not quite understand how it have manifest with such brutal consequence in england scotland and wales there be moral vacuum at the heart of the then government economic policy which be design to cast not just one but maybe two or three generation of man and their family out into the wilderness of worklessness those man and their family and community be treat as subversive when in fact all they be do be assert their right as worker and trade unionist to withdraw their labour as last resort it be not just the policy that be immoral but the strategy and the tactic to divide community and to set worker against worker well we do not forget the solidarity today and the desire for justice and truth about what happen be still as strong do not say these thing to settle score or to make any of my friend on the government benches some of whom come from these community and know much more about they than do feel uncomfortable but the people represent would want and expect to say they and it be my duty and privilege to do so however the positive legacy of mining and miner be still shin light in st helens the work do by the north west miners heritage association be testament to that it preserve the story and memory it have recreate the beautiful banner and it provide support to old friend and comrade as many of the physical sign of our industrial past fade from view the association the brass band and the rugby league club keep the flame alive and ensure that this and subsequent generation know the history of their forebear we need to look after some of their forebear now my hon friend the member for easington and my neighbour the hon member for leigh james grundy talk about miner pension pay tribute to colin rooney from haydock in my constituency who be one of the lead campaigner on that issue hope that those on both front benches that of the outgoing government and that of hopefully the incoming government have hear what have be say on that it be important to say that mining community such as the one represent be as much about the future as the past in st helens one of our flagship regeneration project be the development of parkside it be the last lancashire colliery to close in it lie idle for over year when be elect nine year ago say that it be one of my priority to get the project move that be why be so proud that work with the labour council we have secure ten of million of pound in funding to redevelop and renew the site attract public and private investment build new infrastructure and create employment work with the labour run liverpool city region we secure designate free port status which be attract advanced manufacturing and the job of the future put st helens at the heart of industry and innovation again we be also undertake one of the most ambitious brownfield development project in old mining community in parr and bold create new housing and community facility to help those place thrive that take lot of work not least to clean up contaminate land with limited funding hope that in government my party will look at restore central government funding to do that as part of the very welcome plan to unblock planning and build more good appropriate and affordable housing we know too that we need more job more skill and more business and economic growth the state of the coalfields report which have already be reference give we an enviable evidential base to put our case about where we need investment and what type of investment we need the coalfields regeneration trust continue to be fundamental part of drive policy and progress in our area right across the country and it deserve ongoing and indeed enhance support from government to keep our community move ahead and to identify the help they can be give on that journey the partnership between politician business and local regional and national government be critical to that the work do by organisation such as the industrial communities alliance to drive economic environmental and social renewal be vital part of plan and implement levelling up in whatever guise and under whatever government be proud of the contribution make to those discussion and effort by st helens and the work we be do there martin bond one of our councillor be the chair of the ica for the north west region his grandfather luke maloney from sutton by way of county galway go underground in aged after his own father have be kill in the same pit and stay there for year that be just one example of how the past present and future coalesce in mining community want to finish by give sense of that my friend eric foster and his comrade from the golborne ex miners association have faithfully organise an annual commemoration for the man who die in the disaster at golborne colliery in on march that year one of britain last major mining accident take place there after build up of methane explode and send fireball sear through the mine tunnel we gather from across wigan and st helens some week ago to mark the anniversary we remember those who lose their life john berry colin dallimore desmond edwards patrick grainey peter grainey raymond hill john mckenna walter mcpherson brian sherman and bernard trumble and we stand with brian rawsthorne then year old apprentice electrician from garswood in my constituency who be seriously injure but survive he and the family of the man who perish have bear their grief with great dignity and they and their sacrifice be not forget they can rest assure that whatever we do in everything we do in mining community in future they will always be part of it and part of we thank the hon member for easington grahame morris and my hon friend the member for leigh james grundy for secure the debate be also grateful for the rescheduling of this debate from the very compressed timescale that would have be offer previously because it be so important that we take time on this debate mining have be topic of personal relevance to since long before become an mp be proud boy from ferryhill mining village in the north of my constituency and be familiar with the unique sense of common bond create by the challenging circumstance emanate from the town and village of the durham coalfield which be typical of the coal community right across britain fishburn be the last mine in sedgefield to close in with those at wheatley hill mainsforth and trimdon grange all have close in it have be over year since those community have mine so long ago that the prime minister at the time be harold wilson but the heritage remain strong as we see from this debate despite it be over half century since the mine be there they still identify as mining village the tradition most celebrated as we have hear include the annual miner gala in durham where the banner of the mine be parade have have the privilege of attend some of the friday celebration where the banner be prepare for the saturday with the associate brass band play brass band be strong cultural asset of our mining community culture that be at least as important to the uk as any other as child remember vividly the carnival that take place with jazz band and float that bring people out to enjoy themselves mining be so foundational to these community that they often have half pit wheel prominently display at the entrance to the village we laud the heroism of the coalminer for good reason their work be frequently dangerous with many thousand kill by disease and in accident include the kill at the trimdon grange colliery in my constituency in the black bull pub in ferryhill be rename the dean chapter to respect the man who lose their life in the colliery the local community paper be similarly call the chapter as link to the colliery the dean and chapter pit which be locate next to ferryhill close in and be where my grandfather mine while the coalminer and the community be remember with respect and fondness the mine themselves be not good place to work indeed my hon friend the member for blyth valley ian levy who can not speak in this debate as he be assist the minister tell his grandfather ralph mitcheson go down crofton pit in blyth have leave school at and make my hon friend mam promise never let any of my grandkid go down that pit the hon member for easington and other have refer to the mineworker pension scheme my own position on that be very clear and be on record already he mention the then business energy and industrial strategy committee report on the subject that be one of the first committees serve on in this place and be signatory to that report be pleased to contribute to and be part of that inquiry and stand behind the report here and now there be no more important reflection of the importance of mining in my area than redhills which be know and still be as the pitman parliament in that space each pit have representative chair and now miner family be able to have brass disc attach to the chair name specific miner who go down that particular colliery be proud to say that my grandfather thomas ellis be reference on the dean and chapter chair we must also ensure that member of all party remember our root and that we work together to celebrate mining community history and encourage their future attend the installation of blue plaque in durham to celebrate john forman who play central role in form the durham miners association and be its president from to strangely the only other politician present be the liberal democrat cabinet member for economy and partnership we need cross party engagement because people such as john who work so hard on mine safety even write paper on how coal dust ignite and cause explosion and be see as the head of an organisation and social movement that transform the life of the people of county durham be the root of our community and their value need to be build upon not forget no one would dispute that the past couple of generation of resident have have more than their share of difficulty yet the resilience they have show have be remarkable it be their community identity that be the foundation for everything that be particularly evident in the community support centre that have be establish such as ferryhill ladder cornforth partnership deaf hill community centre trimdon grange community centre trimdon village hall and many other across my sedgefield constituency for the past few year have be co chair of the all party parliamentary group for leave behind neighbourhood which look at the problem of deprive area and propose practical solution to they that be not just the mining village but they be certainly part of that cohort that could be describe as leave behind we have see our request for community wealth fund deliver which should be valuable to many of those community one problem the appg have consistently raise however be low connectivity how can resident aspire to social mobility if they do not even have the physical mobility that would enable they to reach well job in newton aycliffe and netpark we have many employment opportunity yet the bus service connect the mining village to they be appal the single most crucial factor in enable the mining community to thrive again be well transport connection because they invariably have very low level of car ownership and be too isolated for walk or cycling therefore the effort be make to improve transport link be more critical for those community than most hope that the change in the treasury green book to reflect social impact can be turbocharge to deliver for those community wait with interest to see whether our new north east mayor take an interest in these rural connection fervently hope she do and that she do not just spend all her time in the urban centre of the region it be essential that rail connectivity be also improve be delighted that the reopening of ferryhill station which will link my community to tyneside and teesside have be confirm look forward to the new mayor also commit to the leamside line there be rumour that she be not go to but hope they be false because it would be transformational for thousand of people who currently have limit transport option and would gladly use the new station and line to go to work and college will continue to work cross party to push for delivery of that line in particular with the hon member for washington and sunderland west mrs hodgson be wait for the hon gentleman to get to the key moment when he would mention the leamside line and be not disappointed as he know there be connection between our constituency and they could be make even more connected if we get the leamside line reopen he mention that the newly elect mayor may get cold foot on it if she do have bucket of hot water ready and wait for her foot have every faith that it will still be high on her agenda and look forward to be able to get on train from my constituency to the hon gentleman very soon look forward to that opportunity have write to the north east mayor ask for engagement on that and would be delighted if the hon lady join for such meeting should it arise ferryhill station be not just about travel it be also about economic regeneration the station close as part of the beeching cut in the same year that the ferryhill mine close and the same year as it happen that move out of ferryhill to newton aycliffe about six mile away it mean that resident lose not just source of local job but mean of travel to new job it be therefore an imperative that the project which be recently confirm again by the prime minister now make urgent progress like any investment it will show the community at or near the station ferryhill chilton mainsforth dean bank cornforth and bishop middleham that they be value while also present increase opportunity for those that be slightly far away such as spennymoor and tudhoe one of the tenet of my election in be the desire to improve access to opportunity for all and no one be more needing or deserving of opportunity than the resident of what be and still be describe as mining village one cause of mine have be to encourage aspiration particularly for the young people of sedgefield and that flow from session with the ambassador of ferryhill primary school lead by glenys newby as well as visit to school in hurworth wheatley hill and everywhere in between to enable and encourage aspiration it be critical that we create opportunity opportunity come from job and career which be why be so pleased about the growth of netpark science community within two mile of fishburn former mining village close to my mining community be the new town of newton aycliffe which offer job include at hitachi it be fundamental for the recovery of the mining community that industry of the future can be sustain include at hitachi be work with everyone from union to the secretary of state to find way for those industry to continue admirably inspire their workforce in the future however they will help the community most in need only if my mining village can reach they via the bus connection that mention if we wish to secure future growth we must develop new skill be enormously encourage by the growth in apprenticeship in the area where have start since and by the increase quality of our school which be help to deliver well educational outcome over the past year we have go from of our school be rat good or outstanding to today opportunity be support by education and have be delighted to engage not only with school but with the amazing university that support my constituency most notably durham university commend the work be do to reach out to community be delighted that fiona hill the recently appoint chancellor of durham university hail from bishop auckland place with challenge similar to those in my community so she get it fiona hill hail from disadvantaged background but manage to rise to work on the international stage and have now return to become chancellor of durham university support the university shy bairn get nowt project which be an attempt to instil more confidence in our young people so that they speak up and be not only hear but listen to have such hope for the former mining community in my area we need to continue effort to support education and aspiration and to deliver well transport for those community despite their challenge can see the potential they have to reinvent themselves however can not stress enough just how crucial bus and train service be to that process look forward to see the service improve and those amazing community become the place that they deserve to be thank my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris for all his important work on this issue and thank he and the hon member for leigh james grundy for lead this important debate it be pleasure to follow the hon member for sedgefield paul howell will mention channel so refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the miner strike of rip the life of miner and their family apart it rip town such as barnsley apart the miner be shamefully brand the enemy within by the then prime minister man be imprison because they be fight for their job woman run soup kitchen because they be fight for their community over man work down the pit in barnsley to keep the light on and the country move the work be dirty and dangerous but it be respect however the ridley report of plan the destruction of britain coalmine industry and its tactic be deploy under margaret thatcher in they be illustrate in the excellent channel documentary on the miner strike early this year which highlight the experience impact and legacy of the strike year on and show in particular new footage of the event at orgreave on june orgreave change how we be police as society but it also change many life that day as the documentary so powerfully highlight trust in the police be still impact in area such as mine even today constituent of mine in barnsley be still wait for justice for what happen to they at orgreave and they deserve to know the truth many man who go down the pit have suffer from long term health issue the previous labour government give billion worth of compensation to coalminer who have contract lung disease as result of their work for british coal and around million for those who be injure by their use of vibrate tool down the pit however although former miner can seek compensation through the industrial injury disablement benefit claim process many often report that the system be difficult to navigate sadly former miner and their family often tell the national union of mineworkers that they have not be assess correctly and be therefore deem ineligible for the compensation they deserve it be often leave to spouse to fight for miner compensation after their death wait for post mortem to prove that they do indeed have lung full of coal dust and that it be the cause of their severe ill health and subsequent early death we must do well in our approach to this issue so that the man struggle with poor health be give the support they need the num do an important job to this day in support miner in their struggle with industrial disease and it have work with my office on number of case in recent year another issue that affect thousand of my constituent be the mineworker pension scheme yesterday my hon friend the member for barnsley central dan jarvis and meet miner who have travel from barnsley to westminster to meet we and campaign for change to the scheme the average miner have pension of just per week and widow be on lot less through the surplus share arrangement the government have take billion pound out of the scheme and that figure be set to rise to billion in response to parliamentary write question ministers have admit to that the take it or leave it deal when the pit be privatised be do without any actuarial advice be pleased to secure the business energy and industrial strategy committee inquiry into that injustice be grateful to the committee then chair my hon friend the member for bristol north west darren jones he be now shadow chief secretary to the treasury for all his work on the issue his report clearly conclude that the government should not be in the business of profit from miner pension have campaign to secure that enquiry have raise this issue dozen of time in this place have meet ministers and shadow ministers and early this year visit the treasury to make the case once again will continue to campaign for action and justice on the mineworker pension scheme almost of the mining workforce become unemployed in the first year after the strike for community in the north scotland south wales and of course yorkshire where coalmining be vital industry the effect be devastating in year after the pit close grimethorpe in barnsley east be name the poor village in britain that be portray so powerfully in the film brasse off which show the impact on our community last year we mark the anniversary since the pit cease production hundred attend the miner memorial in grimethorpe on the thursday before christmas as they do every year to remember the man who go to work and do not return home as be sadly too often the case at colliery across the country indeed know that you madam deputy speaker as the member for doncaster central regularly attend the armthorpe memorial and have be strong champion for miner economically area such as barnsley have never recover in its report next step in levelling up the former coalfields the coalfields regeneration trust have make number of recommendation for former coalfield area these include strong policy to grow local economy and tackle economic inactivity improvement to the transport infrastructure and increase provision of apprenticeship follow my question in this place be pleased that the secretary of state agree to visit barnsley east to see at first hand the work of the coalfields regeneration trust base in wombwell in my constituency however despite be deserve by every measure barnsley east have miss out on levelling up funding levelling up be mean to support leave behind area but it have fail to do so barnsley be build on coal mining power community and our community power nation when hold an adjournment debate on the mineworker pension scheme in there be man in that scheme but today that number have sadly fall to just under time be run out we can and should do well for our miner whether that be on miner health on miner pension or for mining area as they face the economic legacy of pit closure to this day the national union of mineworkers have banner in barnsley that state the past we inherit the future we build that be just what we need to do build well future for our coalfield community be delighted to be able to speak in this debate be the furth south by long way among the member who will participate but the fact be that cornwall have an incredibly proud heritage and history of mining it be not just about our history we still have thrive mining sector in my constituency and some amazing opportunity to come when most people think about my constituency they be aware of the beach the coast and all that we have to offer tourist but the middle part of my community what we often call the clay village because of the history of china clay mining there have far more in common with former mining village in the north of england than it do with the rest of the south of england represent such diverse constituency that contain so many different element present with some interesting question and challenge our mining history in cornwall go back literally year it go back to the bronze age when tin be discover and mine to create the bronze that be need in that era by roman time tin be already much trade and seek after commodity that be be extract in cornwall at that time cornwall be actually describe as one of the wealthy strip of land anywhere on earth because of the incredible wealth bring by tin mining by medieval time cornwall status as the tin mining capital of the world have become so important and the wealth it generate for the crown have become so significant that set of special body and law be establish through the stannary court and parliament to protect that mining wealth in the and century cornish tin and copper mining reach its zenith the metal mine from cornwall help to provide the raw material for the industrial revolution and be major contributor to the economic growth of our nation and indeed of the empire cornwall have also be at the forefront of pioneer in mining the high pressure steam engine be invent in cornwall by richard trevithick which lead to the creation of the iconic engine house at one point there be over engine house in cornwall and when cornish miner go around the world they take that technology with they in many part of the world where mining take place the same engine house can be see we in cornwall also invent the safety lamp humphry davy invention be another major bit of pioneer safety equipment for miner of the time more recently the extraction of china clay in my constituency have be at the heart of the cornish economy cornwall have the large and high grade deposit of kaolin also know as china clay anywhere in the world and for year now have be extract produce and export high quality china clay be proud that several of my ancestor and my grandfather and my uncle work in the china clay industry by cornwall be produce of the world china clay which revolutionise mid cornwall the part of cornwall that be proud to represent for example the tiny village of west polmear have only nine resident but then charles rashleigh invest huge sum of money to create factory and home for the china clay worker and very quickly it become village of several hundred people he rename the village charlestown not after the king as many think but after himself many people will be familiar with charlestown today as thriving visitor centre and will probably also recognise it as one of the place that be regularly feature in the bbc poldark series that period also see the cornish mining diaspora where about cornish miner and their family leave cornwall to spread literally around the world at that time it be say that if you find hole in the ground anywhere in the world you would find cornishman at the bottom of it today statue commemorate cornish miner can be find in the state of victoria in australia and there be cornish waterwheel in british columbia in canada cornish cultural society in mexico and most importantly cousin jack pasty shop in california all be clear sign of how cornish miner spread around the world however like many of the story we have hear this afternoon the clay village in my constituency as with any mining sector have face huge challenge as the number of people employ have fall the china clay industry use to employ around people in my constituency but today that figure be just over that have present number of challenge for those community economically socially and in term of health they be some of the most disadvantaged community in cornwall and indeed in the country they face challenge in find job many of the job we now have in cornwall that be link to tourism or food production be lower pay and often seasonal as other member have mention the lack of good transport link also present huge challenge however great work have be go on in recent year we be see the regeneration of old china clay pit through the creation of garden village with the construction of about new house new school and new workplace building and real investment in that area new link road be be build through the china clay area with million of government investment which will improve connectivity that be the single big investment in mid cornwall by any government the government have also provide million through the levelling up fund to upgrade the branch line between newquay and par and connect it through to truro and falmouth what we call the mid cornwall metro which will also greatly improve transport connectivity for many of those china clay village we be also see significant investment in st austell hospital which serve many of those community million surgical hub be be build right now and will be open in the come month and the redevelopment of cornwall college in st austell will serve many of those community with brand new campus about to be build in the come month the government have recognise the need of those community more than any previous government they have provide those village with investment to help to address some of the disadvantage they face however this be not just about the mining of the past cornwall have great opportunity that believe will breathe new life into and revive our mining sector lithium extraction we have know for year that there be lithium in cornwall have see old mining map from the show significant deposit of lithium in cornwall but it be only recently because of the need for lithium for produce battery particularly for electric vehicle that there have be market for the mineral two company cornish lithium and imerys british lithium be look to develop the extraction of lithium which will provide the uk with secure domestic supply of what will be one of the most seek after element in the decade to come it be estimate that they could produce of the lithium that british car manufacturing will need for the battery we will have to produce that be very good news not only for cornwall but for the uk in one of his previous job the minister come to visit we and he be aware of the opportunity present it be not only great economic opportunity but believe it provide we with an opportunity to ensure that the extraction of element go into the manufacturing of battery in the uk have the high environmental and ethical standard one concern that local people sometimes raise with be that lithium extraction do not have particularly good reputation around the world either in the ethic apply to it or in its environmental impact however we can produce lithium in cornwall to the high possible environmental standard and to the high ethical standard which think put we in very strong competitive position in the global market there be great opportunity to revive the mining sector and give mid cornwall great future for decade to come be good at take thing out of the ground have be part of cornwall history but lot of the value and the higher pay job have end up elsewhere this time we want to ensure that we capture as much as possible of the value of lithium extraction and that we keep it in cornwall we must create the well pay job in cornwall and keep the value there as much as we can so that there be lasting and positive impact on our economy we be incredibly proud of cornwall heritage and history of mining it be in our dna it be what our people have do for thousand of year but there be also huge opportunity for it to be part of cornwall future and for cornwall to play significant part in our national prosperity once again thank my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris for secure this important debate to mark the anniversary of the miner strike as we hear in his speech he have fight for miner and their family since he be elect in it be also privilege to speak in this debate alongside my hon friend the member for wansbeck ian lavery along with his entire community he be out on strike for the whole year to save the british coal industry and what he and other miner experience be disgrace it be brutal it be callous and it be completely unjust and support my hon friend in his repeat call for public inquiry if margaret thatcher be at the dispatch box today would ask she how could you have do this how could you have leave what be once real community full of life and solidarity in such state of despair and disrepair how could you do this without any plan without any reparation and without any transition nothing for the miner and their family those question apply to all those who enable she her mp her peer and her ally in the medium who spin lie after lie about the miner and the mining industry to all those who do not speak out ask how could you sit on the fence when this cultural and economic vandalism be take place we must be clear about something else miner have no choice but to strike because they know exactly what be at stake not just for themselves but for their family their village and the entire country even at the very least the government owe an apology to the miner and their family there be so much to cover in this debate such as the aftermath of the strike the numerous injustice the wrongful conviction the health inequality and the economic wrong that go on to this day know will not be able to cover everything but time permit will try to cover the role of my constituency the role of woman in the north east and the policy we need to see in coalfield area today be privileged genuinely so to represent the city of durham which host the durham miner gala every year it be the great demonstration of working class solidarity in the world and it would not be possible without the durham miners association which be headquarter at redhills also in my constituency can put on record my thank to the dma particularly alan mardghum and stephen guy for its work in host the gala its support to ex miner and its support to and my office since there have be only few occasion when the gala have be cancel during the world war the general strike and most recently the pandemic it be also cancel in month after the strike begin instead strike rally be hold in its place one right wing paper say that durham look like city under siege on that day but the footage present another picture it show banner and brass band with community and family march together no different to any other gala it be small insight into the way the medium distort the reality of the miner and their community that even an event as joyous as rally in durham could be turn into something sinister by the press that occur throughout the strike and no more so than at orgreave we can not forget what happen on that day to put it simply we need public inquiry on clear day people at the gala can see the top of durham cathedral from the racecourse where they assemble with their banner hon member will know that the cathedral and its community play an important role in the gala the miner festival service during which banner be bless by the bishop of durham have be go on for as long as the gala itself the banner be beautiful and be proud to have contribute to one and to have assist other in get theirs make they represent people and place and they can be as theological as they be political in the south aisle of the cathedral be the miner memorial which be dedicate to durham miner who lose their life in the county pit next to it be book of remembrance list all the man and boy who lose their life and above it hang miner lamp the cathedral play an important role in the strike and no more so than through david jenkins the former bishop of durham let we recall some of his word from his enthronement service in september he say that the miner must not be defeat they be desperate for their community and this desperation force they to action jenkins go on to speak about what happen when mine close and the impact of that on the community he put it bluntly when he say it be death depression and desolation when speak to my friend dave anderson the former member of parliament for blaydon and former miner himself he tell that the effect of the pit closure could be see within month in fact in his speech follow the death of margaret thatcher he say the village where live have see coal mining for almost two century in matter of month after closure we be grip by wave of petty crime burglary and car crime mostly relate to drug we have never recover from it official report april vol what jenkins say be prophetic although the mine be now close the last mine in the city of durham close in we can still secure justice for those affect for instance the minister could say at the dispatch box that he will introduce legislation to pardon the miner who be wrongly convict during the strike because some of the story have hear be as absurd as they be unjust they include that of durham miner who be accuse of breach of the peace for pour cup of tea at the picket line repeat what say at the start we need public inquiry we also need economic justice for our community the dma tell that miner job create many other job in the community and beyond include at least five in the supply chain if we reflect on this point the destruction and recklessness of thatcher government become unambiguous ask at the beginning how her government could do this to their own people the mine be at the heart of the community it be the primary source of employment and everyone know what the consequence be for child it be an injustice that no transitional plan be make as there be and still be in other country germany for instance take long term view about manufacturing why do we we have the potential to lead the world in alternative source of energy we could have reskille and restructure our industry but instead the government choose destruction and say to the labour front bench that we can still do this and we should do this when we form the next government thankfully not all woman be like margaret thatcher during the strike the contribution of working class woman during that strike can not be underestimate heather wood an activist during the strike and great friend to tell that the strike might not have last so long have woman not be involve in the north east woman group like the one heather be involve in be feed up to people day five day week they organise holiday for the child of the miner provide childcare and food during the school holiday and present and toy for the child on the christmas of and help parent find school uniform when the autumn term begin assist people with their household bill and provide emotional support when thing get tough as they so often do it be truly heroic work all do on shoestring all do in the spirit of working class solidarity and when the miner return to work in march the woman support group in the north east continue and importantly their involvement in the strike politicise they and many go into public service become councillor and community activist and they be still do that today with the women against state pension inequality campaign be one of those woman who be politicise by margaret thatcher always say margaret thatcher be the reason join the labour party and the reason be stand here today the young generation might be curious as to why we be all talk about margaret thatcher so much those who do not grow up in the north east in one of those mining community might not quite understand how it feel but she smite our community that be how it feel to grow up under her reign do my hon friend agree that if all our mining community be cluster together into one region even today that region would statistically be the poor region in the country and that be what we be talk about today could not agree more margaret thatcher politicise too to do exactly the opposite of what she do since the destruction and closure of the pit we have see continuous health and economic inequality and my hon friend be right that we be one of the poor region and we desperately need to do something because as have be point out the miner create the wealth of this country in the first place the miner strike might not have be win but the work class definitely be not defeat they be bruise but not defeat people be still come to the gala more than ever in fact and former mining community be still have their banner bless at durham cathedral and that mean something those of we who represent the mining community will keep fight for justice for our community and repeat that there must be no less than pardon for miner wrongly convict in the strike full public inquiry into the event of the strike include those at orgreave and economic justice for miner and their family the miner be not the enemy within they come from family who fight in two world war they represent the good of this country and be proud to represent they in parliament what we need now be labour government to revitalise these coalfield area deliver the justice that miner and their community deserve and fulfil the word of our community the past we inherit the future we build want to declare an interest on whole number of front for today contribution but first thank my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris for bring this topic to the house attention we have hear some fantastic speech here from everyone across the house want to declare an interest because be probably the only miner out of mp currently sit in the house be probably the only member who leave school at the age of and go to the pit together with my father my father be not one of those miner who say sorry you canna gin doon the pit because it dangerous job my father like lot of other want and get their kid employment in the pit that be the way it be and be absolutely proud be proud to be miner be proud to have spend my young day on the coalface six mile under the north sea only foot below the seabed and have get some tremendous memory be really proud of what we have achieve what we achieve collectively as community as the national union of mineworkers how we support each other and would not turn our back on friend and colleague and those in most need we be real fighting force in the community not just in the north east not just in durham and northumberland but right across the country it have be mention that margaret thatcher state clearly that the miner be the enemy within despite people be offend by that see it as badge of honour see that as badge of honour because oppose everything that the tories be do right up to the miner strike and oppose everything or nearly everything they have do since then be one of the enemy within remember be on the picket line with my father who be no long with we my brother my cousin and my friend the only crime we be commit be to fight for job and the future it be never about wage term and condition it be about the right to work and the right to ensure that our community would be secure in the future and we get absolutely blitz for do so our pride turn to great anger when we think about how the government at the time the thatcher government turn the whole state against hard work individual their family and their community and against their only mean of survive and the way in which their community be economically stimulate and when think about the way in which the police and some say the armed force be use against miner during the miner strike do not just witness it be part of it see the brutality and could give number of personal tale that would prefer not to at this moment in time but be proud and be still proud to represent the mining community of south east northumberland live in and represent ashington know as coal town because it be perhaps the big coal produce town in europe if not the world and there be lot of pit in place include bedlington newbiggin morpeth stakeford and guide post we can look at how the miner be tret during the strike and at the fact that year on we still have who be arrest by the police there be thousand sack miner and many of they never get employment again anywhere many be acquit because of dishonest police practice and police evidence again personally witness the horror of the government policy against my own community my own family and personally the call for pardon for the mining industry be accept in scotland which be fantastic move forward and we need to look to do that here personally do not want pardon because do what want to do because want to support my community and for many year do not want anybody tell they be sorry be arrest because would not believe they the life of many miner and lot of other people be absolutely shatter as result of the miner strike know people who be arrest who have never be in trouble with the police before and who end up in police cell the plea bargaining mean either they go to prison or they accept charge for something they have not be involve with at all it be so corrupt it be absolutely disgraceful that be why we need public inquiry my hon friend be make an excellent speech do he agree that one of the thing that the documentary and today debate will achieve hope be for the young generation to learn more about this period in time and that it be as close as we will ever get to become police state if man be travel across the country in car they could be pull over and question about where they be go and even arrest we need people to understand that that be what happen when all our community be do be fight for their job have to say that can not watch those documentary it be too emotional agree with every sentiment that my hon friend express we should never forget what happen number of my hon friend have mention the durham miner the durham miner gala and specifically alan stephen and the whole team there and have huge admiration for they what wonderful day the durham miner gala be with hundred of thousand of individual fly their banner brass band music celebration and speech remember the mining industry have get lot of time for the orgreave truth and justice campaign which have fight valiantly to seek justice for individual involve in orgreave have lot of admiration and support for the woman against pit closures in particular somebody who go unnoticed lot be lady from my patch in south east northumberland ann lilburn she be know as the housewife from hadston and she be absolutely fantastic lead the woman of south east northumberland and later the woman against pit closures have to say if it have not be for the woman during the miner strike be not sure how long it would have last their support be absolutely fabulous pay tribute to man who have sadly pass on rick sumner who for year support the national justice for mineworkers campaign which be to remember sack miner whole number of issue need to and will be raise but want to discuss the mineworker pension scheme the labour party manifesto of and agree to redress the huge anomaly that everybody will mention again declare an interest as be the only current member of the mineworker pension scheme in this place be still member so declare that interest the mineworker pension scheme be defer wage like any pension and that should be recognise the split come in and that be crime we have have billion siphon off and trousere by the tory government let we be honest the beis committee recommendation be not too hard to accept the money be already in the fund and the beis committee say that that money should be redistribute to member many of whom be on less than week some be on less than week be on less than week and be on less than week let we get they pay and make sure we do the right business one thing that need to be focus on be compensation as be mention by my hon friend the member for barnsley east stephanie peacock mining be tough hard and severe job and people have have severe personal problem and consequence as result the government impose wholesale vindictive industrial austerity on the mining community give big thank you to the num and the advice centre up and down the country for the fantastic work they continue to do we have to look at the miner pneumoconiosis scheme which be awful it be so difficult for member to attract compensation even though it be one of the most dreadful disease that we can ever imagine can we not get the department for work and pensions the department for energy security and net zero the coal industry liability team nabarro and the industrial injuries advisory council together in room to see how we can get these payment make people be now suffer greatly as result of work underground and we must make sure that they can gain compensation without the default position be to deny any claim we have issue with ciswo level up the destruction of the mining community and much more to conclude understand that the minister two grandfather be miner think that be right have read that somewhere although be not sure how true it be but he will understand the situation we need to look at level up we need to look at pardon for miner we need justice for the mps we need public inquiry into police of the strike we need wholesale review of compensation scheme in the main and in particular of the pneumoconiosis scheme thank my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris and the hon member for leigh james grundy who be no long in his place for secure today debate it be always real pleasure to follow our miner my hon friend the member for wansbeck ian lavery coalmining be mainstay of the economy for almost century in south shields we have st hilda whitburn harton and westoe collierie it be therefore no surprise that people in my constituency would be hard press not to know or be relate to miner generation of family work down our pit our former pitman will testify that it be not glamorous job it be dirty hard and dangerous graft but those negative be well worth it for the steady income the camaraderie the friendship and the community that they build around our pit that way of life and the social bond be the thing that all former pitman and their family say they miss the most thatcherism have many ugly legacy but the miner strike of to be one of the most visceral personal and define moment of the century it be the moment of the strong resistance against her industrial vandalism and the hollowing out of our mining community not content with close our dock and shipyard the pit suddenly become uneconomical she say those who try to resist this blatant destruction of our community be arrest and convict this weaponisation of the state against ordinary man and woman fight for their livelihood during the strike draw worry parallel with today anti strike legislation it be why we need public inquiry into orgreave and it be why this government should introduce similar legislation to that introduce in the scottish parliament pardon those convict of matter relate to the strike all they be try to do be save their job know all too well what unemployment or the constant threat of it can do both mentally and physically it be utterly soul destroy there be one heartbreaking story that all of we in south shields be sadly familiar with that of lovely family man and colliery engineer make redundant who after drop his child off at school put chain across the front door write goodbye letter to his family climb up the stair go into his bathroom pour petrol over his clothe and with match set himself alight in his pit westoe pit close signal the end of not just coalmine in south tyneside but tradition and way of life our memory of the solidarity of the trade union movement and the rejection of the trickle down economic that have prove such driver of inequality in our region have endure because the challenge face former coalfield community be not consign to the history book they have deepen alongside regional inequality the economic gap between coalfield area and the rest of the uk have be widen considerably over the last decade average earning for worker in former coalfield area be below the national average that be the legacy of de industrialisation south shields as post industrial and coastal constituency have face and continue to face several challenge those be challenge that we have prove time and again that we will always overcome in south shields we do not wait for government help that never come we get on with stuff our port of tyne be now the base of the big offshore wind farm in the world we be home to hundred of small business and we have be instrumental in the fight against poverty pave the way for holiday club and set up mobile community supermarket the government levelling up rhetoric ring hollow in my constituency which have be reject for town fund and freeport bid and two round of level up funding the level of child poverty in south shields remain stubbornly high at and unemployment across south tyneside be which be high than the north east average yet in the chancellor recent budget he allocate london canary wharf double the amount of funding that our entire region will get the privatisation of once nationalise industry that follow our pit closure have do nothing but deepen inequality deliver profit for shareholder and decimate service that we all rely on that be happen at the same time that the government be pocket the miner pension surplus more than billion have be give to the government with million of that in the last three year alone the government keep say that we need to strike fair balance but there be nothing fair about it when miner and their widow be leave destitute on as little as week we should not be surprised because as the waspi woman know all too well this government have form when it come to pension grabbing our miner be prosecute and make redundant and see the heart rip out of their community and now they be be rob of their pension their retirement and the dignity that they all deserve we know all too well in south shields that if you close pit you kill community our proud mining heritage will always remain because of people like gary wilkinson local film maker bob olley our local artist and alan mardghum and stephen guy from the durham miners association and place like south shields museum thank to they the generation who follow will know that underneath the south shields street housing estate and field they walk on there be once thousand of pitman gather coal to power our country we be proud of the past that we have inherit in south shields and it be one that we will continue to use to build our future one that we will build with the next labour government may congratulate the hon member for easington grahame morris on secure this important debate be proud to have be bear and bring up in dailly which be coalmine village in south ayrshire alongside the former mining town and village of cumnock new cumnock dalmellington and patna that be also in my constituency in the and early my late father peter dorans dcm be employ as coalminer at one of the three mine surround the village he work at the coalface as coalminer my father suffer as many do from common industrial disease include vibration white finger and carpal tunnel syndrome from the frequent use of heavy drilling equipment and partial deafness up to the day of his death every time he cough he bring up coal dust from his lung many thousand of coalminer suffer other medical condition include emphysema and breathing relate illness many lose limb and suffer from other life limit condition and injury and early death as result of the work condition in the mine at those time many miner also lose their life in mining disaster will highlight just two from my constituency in september the knockshinnoch mining disaster occur near new cumnock when glaciated lake fill with liquid peat and moss flood the pit trap more than miner underground for number of day thirteen man die in november at the barony colliery near cumnock mine shaft collapse trap two contract worker thomas fyvie and george wade together with two colliery employee henry green and john mcneil despite valiant and sustain effort to rescue they they remain entomb deep underground to this day pay tribute to those man and all who have lose their life and suffer appal life shorten health condition and injury as result of work in the coalmine the debt owe by this country to the man who risk their life to power the country and economy for generation be immense not only do coalminer and their family make that possible they pay terrible price over the century in loss of life and limb and in shortened life cause by the brutal working condition and inadequate housing and health service just to enable other to become wealthy some obscenely so without doubt in the last two century robust work proud man work in incredibly difficult circumstance for what be paltry wage they often rely on meeting unattainable backbreake daily or weekly target to earn barely liveable wage despite those difficulty the miner and their family create and sustain strong supportive community in the face of adversity and come together to look after each other in difficult time interruption excuse large scale coal production end in my constituency when the two large coalmine in the area the killoch and the barony cease production in and respectively with the loss of thousand of mining job and the knock on effect of the loss of countless job in the supply chain and the local economy the hon gentleman be make really important point about the loss of life in mining disaster number of which occur in my constituency too however there be the ongoing legacy of industrial disease yesterday speak to some miner from the midland who be lobby parliament and point out the injustice of the current scheme one of they be suffer from chest disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to qualify for compensation the requirement be year of underground work but he have work only year so he be exclude there be number of other example like that order if the hon member for ayr carrick and cumnock allan dorans find that he be have difficulty speak and want to take some time could move to the next speaker and come back to he think that will be okay madam deputy speaker have have drink so will continue thank the hon gentleman for his intervention totally agree that the system be terribly unjust and that those miner should be properly compensate with great difficulty resist the temptation to mention the part play in the demise of the coal industry by the action of the late former prime minister margaret thatcher interruption the closure of the coalmine and the be sorry madam deputy speaker will take minute call alex davies jones it be pleasure to follow the hon member for ayr carrick and cumnock allan dorans as the proud chair of the all party parliamentary group on coalfield community it be privilege to speak in this debate put on record my thank to the vice chair my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris and the hon member for leigh james grundy who sadly be no long in his place for secure today important debate also thank the other vice chair the right hon member for midlothian owen thompson who be in his place and the former vice chair the hon member for newcastle under lyme aaron bell who have to resign follow his elevation to the government whips office before begin it be important to emphasise that former coalfield area make up significant part of the country span wales scotland and england with combined population large than scotland at around million people these area be far too big to be ignore as the daughter and granddaughter of former miner this topic be of great significance to and to many of my constituent in pontypridd and taff ely this year be the anniversary of the start of the miner strike my father who be at orgreave be one of those who go out on strike the value he stand for community dignity and fairness be the same value seek to uphold even generation on the pain for those affect be still raw yet the legacy of coalmining be about so much more than the miner strike coal be no long dig in our area but that rich seam that power britain industrial revolution still run deep in the vein of our community the closure of the mine may be in the past but the people live with the consequence be not they be live breathe community for the generation which include that have grow up since the strike the challenge be different coalfield community no long suffer the mass unemployment of the and but be we to believe that this change be progress truth be tell many former coalfield area still lag behind much of the rest of the country in some place the number of job lose may have be replace but in far too many case the respected skilled mining and engineering job have be replace with low quality poorly pay employment that be starkly highlight by the all party group recent report next step in levelling up the former coalfields be immensely grateful to my colleague on both side of the house who help shape that report and pay tribute to the industrial communities alliance without which the inquiry and subsequent report would not have be possible the report represent pivotal moment in the coalfield regeneration agenda and set out key step for improve former mining community for the sake of time will focus on just few strong policy be need to grow local economy in our former coalfield that mean an end to the city centric model of growth let we be clear the idea that growth in the city will inevitably trickle down to our town and mining village be utter nonsense coalfield community have strong identity in many case if people have to move away for work or commute to nearby city it be because they have no choice the government levelling up initiative be sadly just slogan we need to be honest about what small short term pot of money be expect to achieve there need to be new model of local and regional development that place the emphasis on grow local economy and that provide long term financial certainty to local authority and other partner and stakeholder one way in which we can develop coalfield economy be by invest in suitable premise for small and medium sized business the coalfields regeneration trust have successful model of investing in unit for small firm and recycle the profit to support the local community the wind up of the coalfield enterprise fund and the coalfield growth fund have result in an unexpected windfall for the treasury of some million that may be small change to the treasury but for our community it could be transformational it be therefore disappointing that the government have so far refuse to return that money to the coalfield to support try and test investment programme while be on the topic of money come back to our community briefly want to mention ciswo the coal industry social welfare organisation which be set up to support asset follow the closure of our mine the asset our miner welfare hall play field facility and village hall be pay for by the miner and bestow in trust to that organisation sadly so many member in this place have share frustration about the woeful and appalling operation management and engagement of the charity urge the minister to look into this as matter of urgency and to talk to the charity minister about what can be do enough be enough we need direct action about exactly what be happen in our community as result of this charity action let express further disappointment as other have in the government once again reject the recommendation of the business and trade committee about renegotiate the mineworker pension scheme the treasury have already surpass billion of surplus surely at time when many family not just in my constituency but across the country face hardship in the cost of living crisis it be only fair that the miner who contribute to the scheme be entitle to fair share of the surplus in addition to the committee recommendation the appg recently celebrate the publication of the state of the coalfields report commission by the coalfields regeneration trust the crt do fantastic work to breathe life back into our former coalfield and be proud to join the organisation to celebrate the launch however its finding only reiterate the necessity of the ica recommendation for example the city centric factor that mention be back up by the report finding that more old people live in our former field than young people with young people graduate and move away to city to seek job opportunity and sadly not return these factor be push our former coalfield even far behind as the employment gap cause an increase in benefit claimant and people have no choice but to commute to city for work the report find that among the four focus area analyse south wales perform the bad for employment shortfall and for the number of out of work benefit claimant which be of deep concern to as south wales mp upon individual inspection we can see progress for our former coalfield but they lag behind the rest of the uk the report find that the average hourly earning for former coalfield area be to low than the national average which be shocking we truly have lot of work to do but thank to this fantastic report we have way to do it and way to navigate it have be pave understand more than most the importance of devolution and the power of give local community the autonomy to make change however in the case of coal tip safety it be anomalous that the welsh government should be financially responsible for address pre devolution issue when other legacy of the coal industry such as water pollution gas leak and pit shaft safety be the responsibility of the uk government fund coal authority because of the landscape of the welsh valley our community be more at risk than those in any other part of the uk the prospect of any repeat of the terrible tragedy of aberfan be truly unthinkable as result the burden of make coal tip safe have fall disproportionately on the welsh government and local authority in wales that can not be fair when speak of value such as community dignity and fairness it be not in the vague philosophical sense these recommendation be the practical application of those value just as my father stand up for his community year ago it be incumbent upon we to stand up for our coalfield community we must take the next step need to ensure that they be fair and more prosperous for the next year would the hon gentleman like to finish his speech would madam deputy speaker thank you will take it slowly and try not to speak with too much passion the consequence of coalmine closure and deprivation in former coalmining community be well document accord to the scottish index of multiple deprivation coalfield area be still over represent among scotland most disadvantaged community of the coalfield area where datum be gather be among scotland most deprived however in east ayrshire in my constituency that figure be shocking in and it remain the same in within the overall measure of deprivation coalfield community have low income bad health and low education and employment outcome than those in of scottish community coalfield community across the uk need and deserve far great funding from the central treasury to significantly increase access to health promotion and care to provide the good school and college and access to university and to stimulate economic activity with an emphasis on high skill and high pay the coalfields regeneration trust be launch in as an independent charity design to fund project that would increase access to employment opportunity education and skill training improve health and wellbee and develop enterprise it have commission two report to examine how former coalfield area compare with the rest of the country on range of social and economic indicator the most recent of these report be publish in and its finding shockingly include the fact that average life expectancy in the former coalfield be around year less than the national average and there be great incidence of long term health problem former coalfield continue to have large number of people of work age out of work and claim incapacity benefit growth in the number of business be generally slow than in the rest of the uk and the employment rate in the coalfield be below the national average all the coalfield of england scotland and wales have an occupational structure that be skew towards manual occupation and low level of high skilled job the finding be damming indictment of how former coalfield community have be neglect by successive government for the past year for those reason alone concerted effort be require by the uk parliament the devolve administrations and local council they must have joint focus on development and improvement across the board in these community much have be make of the current government levelling up agenda which be design to address the long stand problem of the uk regional economic disparity several fund have be set up under the levelling up agenda include the levelling up fund the community renewal fund the share prosperity fund and investment zone however none be target specifically at former coalmining area in june the all party parliamentary group on coalfield community publish the report next step in levelling up the former coalfields with the aim of examine the need of former coalfield community and steering policy to improve the life of resident the report make recommendation cover economic development public investment infrastructure environmental issue housing and skill all of which would make significant difference to my constituency and the rest of the united kingdom be sure that the minister be well aware of those recommendation so will not list they all but say to he that strongly agree with all of they ask he to indicate what progress have be or will be make in implement they in conclusion the time to recognise the contribution of mining community over the century to the economy of the united kingdom and the hardship endure by so many in those community be now be grateful for the work of east ayrshire council south ayrshire council the coalfields regeneration trust and other publicly fund voluntary organisation and charity for their continue work in restore pride sense of community and hope to those community also acknowledge the work carry out in my constituency by the coalfield communities landscape partnership work with east ayrshire council and the galloway and southern ayrshire unesco biosphere deliver significant number of regeneration project include biodiversity and landscape output people engagement activity local interest group training workshop and volunteer activity however that be not in itself enough to restore the former mining community to the vibrant community they once be the former coalmine community which once power the industrial revolution and contribute immensely to the wealth of the united kingdom must now be prioritise receive significant investment and be support and develop to ensure that they once again become thriving and sustainable community able to face the future with hope aspiration and confidence therefore call on the government to significantly increase levelling up funding or preferably introduce new specific funding and set aside the significant resource that be urgently need to regenerate former coalmining community and improve the life and opportunity of the people in my community and across the country it be pleasure to follow the hon member for ayr carrick and cumnock allan dorans thank the hon member for leigh james grundy and my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris for secure the debate my hon friend speak poignantly about the rich tapestry of community organisation that tie together coalfield community although be not around when the coalmine in clara vale in the constituency of my hon friend the member for blaydon liz twist be open spend lot of my youth go up there to visit family member whether it be the pit banner on the wall the methodist church or the community group the heritage of coalmine community be alive and well in the east and be champion by people like my hon friend the member for easington as the new coalfield member of parliament have the distinct privilege of represent the entirety of the selby super pit which in its time be regard as the most technologically advanced coalmine in europe the last coalmine in my constituency be still produce coal within the last decade kellingley colliery or the big as it be know be the last deep pit coalmine to close in britain with the loss of over job so in selby we know thing or two about coal and we be live through the consequence of what the industry end can bring both for our community and for ex mineworker and their family would like to send special thank to the selby branch of the num advice service for all the work it do to advance its member interest we inherit proud past in selby but we in this house need to consider the future that we hope to build as proud representative of coalfield community our work be twofold to provide dignity recognition and support to ex mineworker and their family and to unlock the economic and social potential for future generation in area such as mine where coal be once king nowhere be those question of justice more pressing than in relation to the mineworker pension scheme which many member have speak about so eloquently today since successive government have receive over billion from the scheme and be due to receive at least another billion in due course yet the mineworker who build the profitability of britain coal industry and the wealth of our entire nation have not get fair share of its proceed during the general election since when should note the conservative party have receive no democratic mandate from the electorate boris johnson say categorically that the tories would make sure that no miner sign up to the mineworkers pension scheme be out of pocket we will make sure all their cash be fully protect and return have look into it and we will ensure that do that be solemn black and white categorical assurance make by conservative prime minister to coalfield community it be the reason some mineworker decide to vote for mr johnson party in it be the reason some member on the conservative benches be sit here at all have collect his vote and go back down to london what do that prime minister proceed to do about the promise he have make to coalfield community such as mine absolutely nothing it be yet another damn example of the age old conservative habit of break promise make to northern community in england and to the british people overall final kick in the tooth for mineworker to endure they have live for year with the legacy of thatcherism and be face with the indignity in retirement of be peddle tory false hope meaningful mps reform require government with empathy and desire to see that justice be do that be why be pleased to see the labour party ambition to reform the scheme to provide ex mineworker with the dignity in retirement that they deserve but we can not have dignity without our health if could encourage ministers to take away one thing from this debate it would be to try to bring great compassion and great speed to the assessment of ex mineworker for industrial illness by the department for work and pensions my team and my local num branch have be fight hard for mr anthony rock who be receive percentage of his industrial injury disablement benefit for pneumoconiosis but not for his progressive massive fibrosis which be know to develop directly from his condition there have be egregious and unacceptable delay from the dwp in the several claim that mr rock have make regard his illness he be become seriously unwell so would appreciate it if the minister could meet to discuss how we can advance his case as quickly as possible wish that mr rock case be an isolated one but sadly his experience be all too common for mineworker across the country it be time for the dwp to shape up and take responsibility for treat mineworker with the respect they deserve finally and on note of optimism recently have the pleasure of visit the coalfield regeneration trust business park at the site of the former kellingley colliery it have manage to turn site where people lose their job into thriving business centre for yorkshire small and medium sized enterprise employ local young people in well pay and skilled employment that work must not just continue but expand and flourish because it have be prove that it work and it benefit community such as mine the proposal by the all party parliamentary group on coalfield community and the crt to return cgf and cef fund to allow it to expand its work should receive extremely thoughtful consideration from member across this house for place such as selby our value lie no long in the coal beneath our foot but in the spirit of our people and community legacy bequeath to we by our coalfield heritage the industrial pride skill ingenuity solidarity and communal spirit that be hardwire into such community be some of the most potent tool we have to build well future for our country both back home in yorkshire and across the length of great britain it be our responsibility in this house to do all we can to empower coalfield community to realise that enormous potential thank all member from across the house who be do incredible work to achieve that aim it be pleasure to follow the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather and commend my good friend the hon member for easington grahame morris for secure the debate be proud of my constituency which have rich and vibrant tapestry of mining heritage weave through it not only in the town and village that make it up but in those of we who inhabit they today from the very depth of the earth our townspeople toil to fuel the industrial revolution shape the landscape of our community and leave an everlasting mark on our collective consciousness however alongside the moment of triumph we must also accept and confront the tragedy that have befall our mining community and family the auchengeich pit disaster of will always stand as poignant reminder of the danger face by man in the pursuit of bread for the table every year be humble and honour to stand alongside the former councillor willie doolan and all the member of the local committee as we commemorate that mine disaster remember the man who be lose and their survive family many of whom still live in the local area today their tireless effort to ensure that the tragedy of the auchengeich disaster be never forget be testament to the resilience and strength of our community and thank each and every one of they for all that they do similarly the cardowan colliery disaster of give we all stark reminder of the human cost of industrial progress the ongoing work of my constituent alice morton and campbell provans in organise memorial service to commemorate the life lose in that devastating event be be sure always greatly appreciate by member on both side of the house as the grandson of miner be raise on story of the pit and its man of the graft and the toil and of the togetherness and camaraderie that we have hear so much about today my grandad be out of the pit by the time come along but the scar of pit life remain if listen quietly enough can still hear his cough today but not even the damage of lung ravage by silicosis could dampen his love and affection for his mining friend and comrade be sorry that have not be able to take part fully in the debate but have copy of census return that contain the first mention of the grants from ulster have settle in scotland my great grandfather at the age of come over to work in pit not far from my hon friend constituency my hon friend have mention some of the appalling disaster that have affect the mine in his constituency as well as my constituency and other do he agree that there should be great recognition of the almost unbelievable bravery show by miner who go back into burn pit to look for their friend be it not time that we give they the recognition that their heroism deserve my hon friend have make an important point every time attend the commemoration and hear the real live story wonder why there be not commemoration all over the uk to honour those brave brave man and indeed their family hope that friend on both side of the house will accept that the scottish national party will always stand up in unwavere solidarity with those who choose to strike during the tumultuous time of the past we recognise the hardship endure by miner and their family who often face financial hardship and societal stigma as result of their principle stance the fact that they stand tall in the face of adversity fight not only for their own livelihood but for the future of generation to come will never be forget or underestimate by any of we on these benches or indeed in the mining community the length and breadth of scotland so it be with heavy heart that we must acknowledge the neglect and disregard show by the uk government towards this share history the scottish government with the power available to they have take significant step to alleviate the burden be carry by our mining community through the miners strike pardons scotland act scotland become the first of the four nation of the uk to offer collective and automatic pardon to those convict during the strike that landmark legislation serve as beacon of reconciliation offer some solace to those who bear the scar of past injustice it be imperative that the uk government now follow suit take responsibility for the action of the national coal board and provide compensation for those affect it would be too late for my grandad with his silicosis scar lung but there be people who could benefit and it be time that the government put their house in order and sort this out hope that the minister will comment on that later while the scottish government have do what they can within their power the responsibility for devise compensation scheme rest squarely with the government in this place we also continue to press for uk wide public inquiry into the strike ensure that the voice of miner and their family be hear and their grievance address only through collective action and unity can we achieve meaningful change and deliver justice to those who have be deny it for so long as we look to the future we must ensure that no community be leave behind in the transition to more sustainable economy the recent revelation that the fantastic levelling up bid make by the summerlee museum of scottish industrial life heritage museum in coatbridge be reject by this place be stark reminder of the indifference with which our mining heritage be still treat by this government and indeed this house the project would have secure the preservation of our historical mining past well into our future and its rejection speak volume about the lack of recognition afford to the sacrifice make by generation of miner and their family in the face of neglect and indifference we must stand firm in defence of our mining heritage we on these benches demand that the government recognise the importance of preserve our shared history and provide the necessary support to ensure that future generation can learn from the sacrifice of the past let we together ensure that the legacy of our mining community be never forget and that the voice of those who come before we continue to resonate through the hall of history congratulate my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris on the work that he do to secure the debate and for his admirable opening speech accord to the excellent report the state of the coalfields commission by the coalfields regeneration trust the former coalfield account for of the population in england in scotland and in wales that give we an idea of the scale in wales one in four people there live in former coalfield area and of the importance of today debate mining have be dominant part of welsh life for generation my grandfather be miner my uncle be miner and my father be bevin boy who be send down the local pit during the second world war there be mine across my constituency from the sea on one side to the sea on the other hendy llangennech bynea llwynhendy tumble cross hands pontyberem ponthenri and pontyates and in llanelli itself and burry port with coal being export from those two busy port and of course mining have shape our politic my predecessor as mp for llanelli the great jim griffiths speak passionately from his own experience of the hardship that he see in the mining community in which he be bring up the effect of unemployment poverty malnutrition sickness and industrial injury and take up the fight to bring about the reform that be need to help those who fall on hard time he speak and write about the price wales pay for poverty maternal mortality malnutrition overcrowding condemn housing unemployment silicosis and the terrible affliction of tuberculosis he also highlight the wealth take from wales by coal owner royalty owner and landlord and demand proper response and resource to deal with the country problem when serve in the labour government jim griffiths introduce the family allowances act under which money be pay directly to mother he subsequently introduce the national insurance act and an act close to his heart the national insurance industrial injuries act which be very much bear out of the suffering and difficulty of injure miner that he have witness and which introduce extra benefit for people injure at work that act be universal in that it cover the entire workforce it provide injury benefit for six month disability benefit for the permanently injure and death benefit for dependant it also set up tribunal to assess case rather than claimant have to take on all the responsibility for push their own case now some year later and some year on from the miner strike as be document in the report mention early we have shockingly not eliminate all the problem there be still high level of poverty malnutrition unemployment and sickness in former mining area and there be still much to be do to enable those area to enjoy the same level of wealth as other we know of many of the problem that our former mining community face scatter as they be in south wales up and down steep valley many be in what be now pleasant rural location and some contain quite spacious council or former council own property but their location be clearly intend to be close to the mine where people work now investor developer and young people all want to be near the main artery or in the main town and it be so much more difficult to attract inward investment into the more remote mining community furthermore they be often spread out in different location along the valley make it very difficult to provide service and often there be considerable distance up or down the valley to get to the most basic of facility such as doctor surgery or shop nowadays there be more opportunity for people to work remotely and to set up business that use the internet but some of our mining community also suffer from inadequate broadband speed and poor mobile phone signal want to highlight some specific problem start with my serious concern about the drop in quality of former miner concessionary coal have meet miner in my area who use to receive good quality smokeless coal but now receive very poor quality coal which be cause considerable problem and expense the coal be block up chimney mean that people have to get their chimney sweep more often and at additional expense and the fume and fine ash that it give off pose serious health risk in fact the smell and the fume that emerge from chimney be so bad that they be cause neighbour down the street to complain about the smoke when look into this issue find that there be not an isolated batch of coal and that the problem be widespread on contact wayne thomas of the south wales num learn that as stockpile of anthracite have be run down coal of an inferior quality be supply by russia because of the war in ukraine and the sanction against russia which fully support the supply be halt and an alternative source have to be find understand that the coal now come from peru and be supply in compress duff use molasse as bind agent the num say that such coal give off very fine ash which cause respiratory problem obviously not good for ex miner many of whom already have breathing problem across the uk the complaint be similar to those of former miner in my area who complain that the smoke from chimney smell funny and that the coal cause blockage the num have twice meet the head of the coal liability unit at the department for business and trade to discuss this matter but there have be no news of any improved source and well source must be find say to the minister that miner have work hard in difficult and dangerous job and that they be entitle to receive decent concessionary coal it be shock that former miner many of whom be elderly be now be give poisonous poor quality coal which give off fume and ash that be bad for their health and which clog up their chimney as matter of urgency beg he to do everything he can to source decent coal for our former miner it be government responsibility turn to the miner pension pay tribute to my hon friend the members for barnsley east stephanie peacock and for bristol north west darren jones for their work hope the minister be aware of the former beis committee report on the mineworker pension scheme and its recommendation namely that the surplus sharing arrangement should be comprehensively review to ensure that miner get their fair share and that the billion reserve fund should be give back to the pensioner immediately it be now three year since that report and former miner be not get any young but there have still not be any action from the government ask the minister to look again at the scheme and to ensure that miner get their fair share turn now to the coal tip legacy be very impressionable small child at the time of the aberfan coal disaster on october be the same age as some of the child bury under the slag heap as it engulf the school and will never forget the image on our black and white telly of father desperately try to dig out their child follow that we see the gradual remediation of the tip thing begin to look well and greener but with the increase frequency of more violent weather event it be now clear that the job be not do as we see all too vividly in the rhondda couple of year ago there be still lot more work to be do to ensure that the tip be safe this be legacy from pre devolution time the slag heap be produce as result of mining coal to fuel the factory that fill the coffer of the uk treasury and the uk government have responsibility to ensure that every tip in wales be make safe we in carmarthenshire be relatively lucky with few and less risky tip than in the valley far east where urgent investment be need it be very disappointing that there be no mention of any funding in the spring budget and ask the minister to take this message back to the chancellor turn to orgreave on june we will mark year since we see the truly shocking scene of police attack miner at orgreave and we need proper inquiry into what happen that day it be very disappointing that the government have not instigate such an inquiry even after the revelation about south yorkshire police in bishop james jones hillsborough report however we need not only an inquiry into orgreave but proper hillsborough law it be not enough for the government belate response to the hillsborough report in december last year to espouse the introduction of voluntary charter an independent public advocate and code of ethical policing instead we need full hillsborough law to force those in public office to co operate fully with investigation and to guarantee fair funding to enable those affect by major tragedy to challenge public institution urge the minister to set up an inquiry into orgreave and to adopt full hillsborough law want to say few word about just transition to the industry of the future which be the exact opposite of what we see in the when it be clear that the thatcher government want to destroy the coal industry however it be not just the coal industry that be decimate we see the closure of the big steel plant in my constituency and numerous other closure across the country result in area of mass unemployment with community feel that they have be throw on the scrapheap the legacy remain till this day as document in the coalfields regeneration trust report it do not have to be like this of course we want to make progress and to harness technology to our advantage whether it be the spin mill of the century motorise transport robot on the production line artificial intelligence the transition from fossil fuel to renewable or the change from blast furnace steel production to green primary steelmaking but it should be just transition with training and job for worker and investment in the new green industry of the future that be why it be so disappointing to see the government half hearted approach to the future of the steel industry we welcome investment in the electric arc furnace but there be refusal to think big and to invest in the green primary steelmaking of the future leave thousand of worker to lose their job it be devastating blow for port talbot and yet again the surround former coalfield community we in the labour party be determined to see just transition to the industry of the future with proper investment through our propose national wealth fund the upskilling of worker and the creation of quality job never again do we want to see worker throw on the scrapheap and community devastate order after kevan jones we will have the front bench contribution and then the wind up from grahame morris congratulate my durham colleague my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris on secure this afternoon important debate for the last year have have the privilege of represent north durham which be part of the once mighty durham coalfield over those year have see many change my hon friend the member for wansbeck ian lavery speak about the close knit tradition of mining community not just in county durham but in his own area in northumberland have grow up as the son of miner be familiar with that close knit tradition and the reliability of work that there be in such community however do not look at the past through rose tint spectacle because to use hobbesian phrase life be nasty brutish and short for many people there be nothing romantic about the death rate which we just accept as the price of coal but many of the community in my constituency the town of stanley for example be build on coal the surround village such as craghead sacriston and other be all build because of coalmine their economic existence be coalmine when that be finally take away in when the last pit close the economic heart be rip out of those community overnight as have be mention by many hon member who have contribute to today debate today people would not recognise where the mining industry be base in north durham unless they know the history of the area they would certainly not know where the pit be in the south yorkshire village where grow up if they do not know the history of that village that unseen legacy have cast long shadow over many mining community congratulate the coalfields regeneration trust on its excellent report on the state of coalfield community in it be superb piece of work when be first elect the legacy of heavy industry and certainly coalmine be evident in my constituency people who have work underground their whole life suffer from not only debilitate lung disease but other physical condition relate to heavy industry sadly that generation be increasingly no long with we after that social fabric be take out of county durham we have unemployment deprivation and poverty and as happen in many community crime and drug fill the gap when be first elect describe north durham as rural constituency with urban problem and as in the constituency of my hon friend the members for easington and for wansbeck the legacy of drug abuse for example be still there today this health inequality be now affect lost generation of young people bear in the some now in their who never get into proper pay employment the report from the coalfields regeneration trust speak for itself life expectancy in coalfield community be for woman as oppose to in the south east of england and for man as oppose to in the south east of england the other thing that appal have speak about this before and feel very passionately about it be that in wealthy country life expectancy in county durham have go down over the last year which be an absolute disgrace the report also outline that in the proportion of the population report bad or very bad health be in former coalfield area compare with in the south east of england and in london we have legacy of ill health health professional in county durham tell that the age at which people access intensive healthcare be now in their mid to late that put extra pressure on our health service which be not reflect in the funding in addition my constituency be now in the commuter belt for tyneside and other area which be very difficult for people in many outlying community unless they have access to car young people do not have aspiration which be difficult to raise to get into good well pay employment warehousing and other low skilled or semi skilled work be no replacement for the high quality job that we use to have in the coalfield we have hear lot of talk from the government about level up have say it before and will say it again level up be complete con it be not serious measure to level up britain if it be the community highlight by the report would be at the top of the list it be all about capital project and pork barrel politic basically set area against one another council have spend million of pound certainly in county durham case submit bid that be never go to succeed the only successful bid from county durham be in bishop auckland which happen to have conservative member of parliament get half bypass in the process level up have not replace the million that the government have take out of durham county council core funding by shift the tax base on to local council tax payer my hon friend the member for easington speak about the low council tax base in county durham where of property be in band which mean that we can not raise money additionally we need extra service for our grow elderly population and our grow number of look after child be there relationship between the closure of sure start centre which offer early intervention for family and the number of look after child who be come back into care it do not take genius to work out that the two be related and the government have slowly wake up to that fact and be now reintroduce child centre we also have access to european regional development funding again it be promise that no region would lose out but we have that money automatically come to area like the north east and it do some fantastic work it do not fixate on capital project at which the local member of parliament or whoever want to be elect could open plaque it be about employment and training work with my hon friend the member for easington on durhamworks which have be very good at get young people who be not in education employment or training back into work level up have be complete con and we need that investment if we be to make real change to health employment and training the prime minister let the cat out of the bag when he stand for the leadership of the tory party and boast that he would take money away from area like mine and redistribute it to leafy part of the south east of england that be exactly what have happen and the idea that the government can take the need base element out of this be absolutely disgraceful the idea that they can give coalfield area the odd million here and there to replace the hundred of million of pound that they have lose in local government funding erdf funding and other funding be just con look back to the last labour government with clear eye county durham have five new school three new health centre new hospital and two new further education college that be real investment in community be also proud that in government we pay compensation to people with copd which should have be do many year early it take labour government to do that we need radical change of approach which no one can foresee at the fag end of this parliament it will only happen with the election of labour government who will reprioritise the need of individual without that the legacy of limited employment opportunity and ill health in our coalmine community will continue not just for those who work in the industry but for generation to come in wealthy country like britain it be national scandal that we should leave such community to suffer in this way commend the hon member for easington grahame morris and for leigh james grundy on secure this excellent debate in which we have hear some common theme also thank the chair of the all party parliamentary group on coalfield community the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones for drive forward its excellent work be strike by the sense of pride express by everyone who have take part in this debate whether it be the hon member for wansbeck ian lavery who have first hand experience at the coalface or the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather who be chronologically challenge through no fault of his own have no such experience although that do not diminish how we all feel about the community we represent grow up in mining community and that sense of community be part of we which be very evident from everyone who have take part today therefore welcome the opportunity to sum up this debate for the scottish national party as member will probably be aware have make many contribution in this chamber about my constituency and its rich mining history which date back to the century when the monk at newbattle abbey first begin extract coal by the century mining be an integral part of my community way of life midlothian be home to range of pit with probably the well know be bilston glen and monktonhall we also have the first victorian super pit the lady victoria which be still the home of the national mining museum scotland again extend an invitation to member to visit it as it be an excellent facility it be open by my predecessor david hamilton also former miner it be the uk first single facility for understanding and commemorate the mining industry and so be an excellent attraction that people can come to see any time they visit midlothian we hear lot today about the fact that we be mark the anniversary of the miner strike of the which leave scar in many community across scotland and the rest of the uk its unique set of circumstance see entire community defend their way of life and their job against uk tory government who seem determined to bring they to their knee and deploy the force of the state to meet that end as be narrate in the john scott kc review in which be commission by the scottish government some miner be dismiss notwithstanding the fact that they have be admonish in court dismissal bring with it financial hardship with loss of income and pension right and difficulty for many in obtain future employment above all miner and their family lose their good name and their respectability as honest hard work man do dangerous job that loss be perhaps the deep one cut they hard and be the hard to bear the corrosive and bitter scar leave by the impact of that thatcher government on once proud mining community which feel abandon by the state be there for all to see that be why along with many other have call many time for full inquiry into exactly what happen at that time we have hear the call for justice for orgreave again today we need to understand and our community need to understand what political influence be exert at that time and what political interference take place in respect of the action and decision of thatcher government recall realise at the time that ian macgregor the chair of the national coal board have work out that if way could be find to sack somebody for gross misconduct that would be lot cheap than pay they the redundancy payment to which they be entitle do my hon friend believe that one day we will find that that be matter of policy on behalf of the ncb truly hope that we do because only when we get the answer to these question the honest answer from government can our community and those directly involve truly move forward accept that we be not talk about decision make by this government but it would be for they to take the opportunity to start that inquiry so that we can get those answer we be about to have debate about bbc bias be young correspondent at that time and recall just how biased lot of the coverage be we constantly see thing from the police point of view but never see thing from the miner point of view what lesson do my hon friend think there be to learn from any inquiry on press and medium coverage during that strike as we hear from other early in the debate it be important that all side be reflect and that the reality of the situation be reflect be perhaps proud to say that be too young to remember watch much of the coverage live at the time although have watch the more recent documentary so can not speak directly about my experience of what be broadcast at the time that move on to how proud be that the scottish parliament have unanimously believe introduce pardon for miner who be convict of certain offence during the miner strike however be frustrated that we have not see more action take to do the same here miner and those who be involve in the strike in my constituency in the constituency of my hon friend the members for ayr carrick and cumnock allan dorans and for coatbridge chryston and bellshill steven bonnar and in those of other colleague in scotland can not get the compensation that feel they deserve until we have uk wide pardon in place that be why take the unusual step of introduce my miners strike pardons bill in this place hope that member across the chamber will support it it have be draft so all the government need to do be support it and we could put that pardon in place to mirror the one establish by the scottish government hope we will see that happen genuinely hope that if this government do not do that the next one will however write to the right hon member for islington north about my bill in december and have not yet receive response interruption sorry not islington north mean the leader of the labour party can keep up with these london constituency have have no reply from he in support of my bill and that be deeply disappointing hope that enough colleague on the labour benches will have word in his ear to make sure that that pardon be introduce the hon member for pontypridd highlight the work of the all party parliamentary group on coalfield community and the state of the coalfields report that excellent report have go into lot of depth on the issue that our coalfield community still face the inquiry receive more than submission from across scotland england and wales be glad that the scottish government local authority and the voluntary and community sector all contribute to that it be important that where we have an evidence base such as this we look at it in lot of detail and understand well what it mean for each of our community like so many other be deeply disappointed by the lack of level up and the fact that for many of our community it feel as though that have simply be government slogan we need funding to shore up our coalfield community and stop they fall far behind have always say that there need to be more even and balanced distribution of the uk prosperity we can not just have it all drive into one place and our coalfield need it far more than most the pit closure leave lasting legacy of social and economic damage that result from decision make in this place and it be up to this place to do much much more to deal with it midlothian and other mining community must benefit from any new fund and initiative that could help to boost recovery finally come to another issue that have be touch on by many member the miner pension commend the hon member for barnsley east stephanie peacock for her work in drive forward the review on that it be long overdue that these recommendation be implement the beis committee report from need to be implement now our miner deserve fairness the surplus arrangement have be in place since we have hear about figure such as billion and rise without even adjust it for inflation that money should be go to our miner at the very least it should be go into our coalfield community it be outrageous that it be take so long to implement this we need it to happen as soon as possible number of miner include my constituent ally have encounter situation where they be mis sell pension product from their miner pension despite try endlessly to get an outcome on that they have find that the company involve have often go bust and track they down be massive issue for anyone ask the minister to relay to the treasury the need for great understanding of the impact this be have on former miner and the need for further look at what be possible when that situation arise will certainly continue to try to bring that about today debate have be excellent it have show the spirit that be still there in our mining community it be not go away any time soon and we will all continue to campaign for justice for our miner let start by thank my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris and the hon member for leigh james grundy for secure this debate also thank right hon and hon member for their contribution we hear from my hon friend the members for easington for barnsley east stephanie peacock for city of durham mary kelly foy for wansbeck ian lavery for south shields mrs lewell buck for pontypridd alex davies jones for selby and ainsty keir mather and for llanelli dame nia griffith and from my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones all of they speak about the coalfields regeneration trust state of the coalfields report and the miner pension scheme it be pleasure to respond to the debate on behalf of the opposition not least because these issue be deeply personal for my constituent as they be for member from across coalfield community it would be difficult to overstate the impact of the coal industry on my constituency and on the north east as whole its history be weave into the fabric of our community many town and village owe their existence to the pit today statue and colliery wheel commemorate our past and community facility set up to serve mining family remain in use in my constituency there be many colliery from chopwell to kibblesworth and from greenside to bewicke main each pit be surround by community in which coal be not just job but way of life like other right hon and hon member could not go without mention the annual big meeting the durham miner gala each year brilliant fly banner and march brass band bring together thousand in our region to celebrate working class life and solidarity so far have talk about my local area but the mining history of the uk stretch far and wide from the coalfield in lanarkshire to mine in the midland on to the welsh valley and all the way down to kent think the hon lady have miss cornwall from her list indeed notice the similarity in what the hon member say between his community and our coalmine community let we be clear that the reality of work down the pit be far from romantic miner toil in brutal working condition do backbreake work in the near darkness as we have hear many people lose their life in disaster or develop industrial disease such as pneumoconiosis as result of their work it be important that we remember and pay tribute to they mining community know well than anyone that this work be tough and dangerous but whole way of life be build around the pit their rapid closure cause mass upheaval the consequence of which be still feel to this day as the report from the industrial communities alliance have highlight former coalfield area still suffer from lack of skilled well pay job as well as from high level of economic inactivity while employment rate have improve since the day of mass unemployment many people still feel there be few meaningful and secure alternative to the work that be once available labour be determined that we will not abandon our community to the whim of industrial change through our green prosperity plan we will seize the opportunity of energy transition to deliver economic justice and rebuild the strength of our industrial heartland we will create secure clean job back by strong trade union with individual and collective right guarantee for all worker our former mining community power we through the industrial revolution and it be not right that many people within they be force to rely on insecure zero hour contract or leave vulnerable to fire and rehire that be why labour new deal for work people will put an end to those practice and build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out to deliver high growth high wage economy for all this government come to power talk about level up but inequality remain as stark as ever report from the appg on coalfield community in partnership with the industrial communities alliance speak of the failure of the current approach to deliver for former coalfield area pot allocate by competitive bidding be too haphazard and too short term to allow for the development that be need to transform former industrial site coalfield community must be allow to come together and to learn from each other not make to compete like contestant on dragons den not only must we deliver well future for our community but we must right the wrong of the past as we have hear the party in government have break promise about the mineworker pension scheme do the minister think it be fair that the government make vast amount of money from the current arrangement while former miner struggle to make end meet let be clear this be historic injustice that should never have take place and the government should not be in the business of profit off mineworker pension after so many year of silence from parliament on this issue the beis committee inquiry be very welcome the labour party will work with mineworker and their family to right this wrong and we will set out our full plan on this by the time of the election people should be in no doubt that we will deliver justice for mineworker and their family with the urgency require we must never shrug off injustice we all remember the violent image of the strike in and perhaps no more so than the sight of lesley boulton cower in the face of police truncheon at the orgreave coking plant early this year new footage from orgreave be show in channel documentary which clearly set out the police brutality and allegation of cover up the former prime minister the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may consider the case for an inquiry but it seem that the government no long think that they have any lesson to learn their memory be clearly short the labour party have long support full investigation or inquiry into the event at orgreave and we be commit to put new hillsborough law on to the statute book to prevent future injustice hope the minister share my conviction that the truth must be hear our coalmine day may be behind we but we must not forget the community that form around they they be the engine that power britain industrial success and we owe it to they that they should share in the reward it be genuinely great pleasure to respond on behalf of the government in this important area of policy be grateful to all right hon and hon member who have contribute to the debate welcome the focus on this issue congratulate the all party parliamentary group its current chair the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones and all those who be involve or who have previously be involve for raise these issue we might not agree on all element but across the house we all agree that this be an important subject that we need to debate particularly welcome the debate because also have the privilege of represent coalfield seat north east derbyshire the home of ireland williamthorpe renishaw park hartington and park house where just century ago ten of thousand of man work many colleague have outline their experience today it be privilege to know that our ancestor go down those pit every single day agree with the hon member for blaydon liz twist that this work be tough and dangerous not single member of my family or any of the people have have the privilege of represent for seven year have fail to remind how difficult mining be be sure that many right hon and hon member have have similar conversation eckington drift mine the last drift mine in my constituency close only five year ago contrary to what we hear in some contribution in my constituency we regularly celebrate our mining legacy from the recent opening of memorial for high moor and westhorpe colliery from pat bone work at the killamarsh heritage society to attend remembrance service for the terrible loss of soul in markham colliery disaster in few week hope with my family to add my ancestor name to the eckington mining memorial which paul burdett and his team have so kindly put in one of the town in north east derbyshire as the hon member for wansbeck ian lavery indicate my family be also deeply steep in this legacy go back around generation as far back as the census go we be miner or hewer my mum maiden name be literally collier both my grandfather work down the mine include my mum dad who work for time at westthorpe and high moor in the area that now have the privilege to represent like so many of the people there both of their life be cut short manage to know my maternal grandfather for only seven year before he die of the injury that he have suffer down the pit in the include lose limb never know my other grandad he die seven year before be bear so share the acute sense of link with this and agree that this be an area in which we need to do more when speak from this dispatch box do so with great pride on behalf of mining community and my own family but it be pride ting with little bit of sadness be afraid that be not intend to talk about this but think that it be important that do so do not particularly want to bring party politic into this but think that party politic have already be bring into this quite significantly over the course of this debate many strong point have be make today by colleague across the house agree with the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones that at time ciswo do not discharge what we all hope it would do and shall certainly pass that back to my colleague in the relevant department agree with most member who say that there be more to do be interested in the concern of the hon member for llanelli dame nia griffith about the quality of coal which shall take up with colleague in the department for business and trade and ask they to look at that in further detail as much as they be able to do so however do think that some of the language have be genuinely loose today the hon member for wansbeck talk about oppose absolutely everything that the conservative party do the hon member for city of durham mary kelly foy talk about thing be callous or about how the government choose destruction the hon member for coatbridge chryston and bellshill steven bonnar talk about indifference there be place for rhetoric and place for hyperbole rise be absolutely not go to take any intervention have listen to the grievance of opposition members for three hour and it be now time for they to hear the alternative labour do not own the story of mining in our country labour do not get to reset the narrative in the way that it have seek to do today the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather talk about government of empathy labour do not get to disregard the settle pension arrangement arrangement defend by the labour party for year when they sit on the government benches in when the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband he be in his place moment ago be in charge of his department junior ministers be send out to answer write question to that effect labour do not get to reset the agenda on that it certainly do not get to repeatedly let down mining community for decade to the extent where those community will the minister give way will not give way have listen for three hour to the labour party grievance labour do not get to set the narrative have let down mining community for year to the extent that those mining community send to this place people such as myself and many of those who be sit behind right now people come up to we and say that we have do more in four year than the labour party manage in labour do not get to reset that agenda today so many labour members have rightly draw on their community history as part of their speech just as be do and shall draw little bit more on mine want to refer in particular to one of my predecessor who sit in this place for north east derbyshire but not my benches he join this place not as member of the labour party but he be former executive member of the miners federation of great britain he build his career in mining will pass his statue when go home today he do not join here as labour member but he feel force to join the party because he be miner in the end though he leave the labour party that be story of our time in these community our mining heritage be share it be not party political yield to no one in this place when it come to the proud legacy that mining have provide for my community and my family it be not just own by one group of we here that be why we turn now to some of the point that have be raise many member have talk about level up accept that there be more to do in that area we have always indicate that level up be long term initiative that will take time to work but at least this government have make progress will the minister give way the hon lady have many minute in which to set out her view and now will respond to it the hon member for easington talk about the government continue to undermine the local community choose to invest elsewhere the hon member for pontypridd say that sadly level up be just slogan the right hon member for north durham mr jones talk about it be con well let we list few up project let we pick some area totally at random shall we pick easington cover by the north east investment zone across the county the share from the uk share prosperity fund have be million with for the town accelerator fund let we pick st helens from the english city regional capital regeneration funding there have be million for st helens manufacture million for town deal and long term plan for town cover newton le willows the hon member for barnsley east wish to speak again barnsley have receive share of million from the uk share prosperity million for barnsley futures for town accelerator and future high street fund of million what about the hon member for city of durham durham have have for redhills reveal through the community ownership fund and share of million from the uk spf what about the hon member for wansbeck wansbeck have receive million for town centre regeneration in ashington share of million from the uk spf and from the north east investment zone share of million the hon member for south shields mrs lewell buck say that government support never come except it do come with levelling up partnership million for the future high street fund and million for the south shields riverside transformation what about the hon member for pontypridd pontypridd receive million from the levelling up fund and million for the dualle scheme what about the hon member for selby and ainsty selby receive share of million from the uk spf what about the hon member for llanelli there have be million for regenerate llanelli the list go on and on interruption the reason opposition members do not want to hear this be because their narrative do not work mining community have have significant amount of attention from this be extremely proud to represent mining community where be we leave after that heat rather than light this be very important subject which we share in even though have have to set the record straight on number of area there be some genuinely useful contribution there be need to remember but not to dwell because the mining community that have the privilege to represent want to look forward not back it want to celebrate its history but to be know for its potential opportunity and renewal the past be what we inherit but the future be what we build it be the future that this government will continue to build to ensure that mining community such as mine and everybody in this place continue to prosper and thrive mr deputy speaker may thank you and madam deputy speaker for your admirable chairing of this very good debate thank my co sponsor the hon member for leigh james grundy for his work behind the scene to secure enough colleague signature to get the debate more than mp support it and make speech or intervene think we have some excellent contribution particularly from opposition members obviously be biased although there be some very good one from across the whole house thank the lobbyist who come down yesterday from the national mineworker pension scheme my constituent john trewhitt bert moncur and ted slavin who make the journey and lobby downing street and parliament about the anomaly with the mineworker pension surplus do not agree with the minister analysis urge he to act with alacrity have look that up it mean physical quickness couple with eagerness or enthusiasm in address the issue that have be raise thank the respective front benchers and thank those on the labour front bench for their commitment to mineworker pension there be big job of work to do thank everyone for their participation today as good welshman be honour to put the question question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider miner and mining community bbc mid term charter review beg to move that this house have consider the bbc mid term charter review be grateful to the backbench business committee for provide time for this debate on the bbc charter and its performance must add that my application be support by no few than colleague from across the house good weather one line whip and local election fatigue suspect have intervene but have not diminish the importance of the debate to all those voter who watch and hear the bbc and pay for it and for whom speak today the reason for my propose this debate be that the government mid term review of january be only announce by write ministerial statement and not on the floor of the house itself and therefore be not properly discuss the question will deal with be whether this mid term review satisfy the genuine concern about the manner in which the charter should operate be somewhat involved in the charter review that lead to the new charter in that propose define new purpose for the charter specifically on the question of impartiality which be insert also propose conditional licence on the impartiality issue as long ago as the debate on the broadcasting act for broadcast licence holder which be incorporate in the act so at least have be consistent the new charter provide that the bbc would be govern by new unitary board and regulation would pass to ofcom as an external and independent regulator the question be whether that have work effectively in deliver for licence fee payer in the national interest by strengthen the oversight of the bbc complaint procedure with proper independence and enable ofcom to regulate the bbc online public service the government tell we in their review that impartiality be core to the bbc responsibility under the charter the bbc run million deficit in with an annual income believe it or not of billion and operating cost of billion in comparison the democratically elect house of commons our bastion of freedom and accountability together with the house of lords merely cost around million year give that the bbc have massive influence on public opinion and be unelecte that make the rule of impartiality fundamental to its justification the government review also point out that impartiality be one area where the bbc be see by survey to be less favourably compare in the provision of news and exhort the bbc to improve that and to maintain the trust of the public and the audience think the hon gentleman have somewhat lose the house none of we understand what the connection be between expenditure by parliament and expenditure by the national broadcaster can he far develop why that be relevant can assure the hon gentleman that have not lose anything at all it be very simple the fact be that in parliament we have proper debate by elect people and decision make on matter of public importance whatever the outcome and whatever the view express they be democratically decide the decision put across by the bbc quite often be the result of kind of centrist viewpoint which will come on to later which be inevitably not consistent with the view of the public who pay for the benefit if that be what it be to be call of watch and listen to the programme in question the government review recommend that the bbc publish more information on how it carry out its work on impartiality and how it respond to ofcom challenge to improve its performance new complaint system have be establish under the principle of bbc first but the question remain whether that have work the number of complaint make to ofcom about the bbc impartiality have increase and the evidence be that the bbc be not meet this challenge it be understand that there have be substantial disagreement between the government and the bbc during the creation of this new complaint system but it be still find want and ofcom need to improve its own performance it be also understand that many former bbc employee with bbc sympathy remain in ofcom and be involve in this process that also represent problem the ultimate result of which be unsatisfactory clearly the government be not sufficiently satisfied with the bbc at the moment or with ofcom performance on this vital question that be bad news as the government point out the bbc have fail to have sufficiently robust internal system for identify the statistical datum to determine its analysis of complaint the government state that the independence of complaint handling indicate that the bbc can do more to ensure that audience feel that their complaint will be fairly consider number of point need to be make know something of this because the european scrutiny committee which chair take evidence from the bbc nine year ago on the issue of bias we criticise the bbc on the question of the european issue before the referendum take place the distinguished lord wilson of dinton make same kind of criticism of bias in his own report all these year later the government remain concerned even now that the manner in which complaint be deal with and the datum involve continue to be profoundly unsatisfactory be afraid that be one of those who have be distract and will not be able to remain to speak in the debate take very great interest in the report by lord wilson of dinton not least because it do not denigrate the integrity of people in the bbc it do uncover however an unconscious preconception about what certain view on the european community mean the report be about the impartiality of the bbc when report matter concern the european union it make lot of people in the bbc extremely angry people from the bbc tell that it should never have be commission even though it be totally objective report when confront with it the bbc still get very angry about it which suggest that there be different atmosphere in the bbc about certain issue nobody ever think that they themselves be biased and the bbc do not think it be biased but it can unconsciously produce very one sided approach to particular issue such as the european union and in that case about the single currency indeed the proof be in the pudding and be demonstrate by the outcome of the referendum on june my hon friend be right actually this be about unconscious bias in some case and very positive groupthink in other that be where the problem lie somewhere in between on limited budget the voluntary organisation news watch do the job extremely well it state the bbc continue stonewalling of complaint inadequacy of ofcom in its watchdog role and the lack of effective reform propose by the mid term review to ensure impartiality remain fundamental problem thus the national interest be undermine and the right of the licence fee payer to have proper system in place be deny he news watch be call rightly in my opinion for much more radical reform to ensure impartiality with fully independent complaint system more transparency and accountability and effort to improve diversity of opinion among bbc staff through new staff training initiative to ensure impartial research and analysis all those be urgent the mid term review do not in my opinion provide proper system for determine breach of impartiality and allow the bbc and ofcom undue latitude in interpret what the word due impartiality mean leave the bbc as its own judge and jury indeed in the past year the new bbc editorial complaint unit otherwise know as the ecu have uphold only one impartiality complaint people simply will not believe that but it be fact neither the bbc nor ofcom routinely publish detailed datum on the vast majority of the nearly million complaint receive since ofcom become the regulator in april the system be therefore not fit for purpose ofcom own figure indicate that complaint relate to bias make up as much as of the complaint and complaint about misleading and dishonest content make up further amount to approximately complaint about bias since ofcom take over of the complaint uphold or partly uphold by the new ecu system only be accept as relate to bias which be an absurd and minuscule proportion we do not yet have the late figure those relate to but the provisional information indicate that the ecu consider complaint of which only be fully or partially uphold and be not uphold the situation be shocking and demonstrate an intrinsic failure of the system it must be make fully independent and must not be judge and jury wonder what the hon gentleman think about the mid term review own conclusion that there be clear evidence that adherence to impartiality and editorial standard be now at the heart of the bbc priority it be at the heart of the bbc priority in theory but not in practice ofcom be insufficiently independent and it be understand that there be deep concern about the entrench tie between its content board and the bbc which still persist and therefore lack of accountability mere of the public now believe that the corporation be impartial the bbc refuse to engage with complaint that do not refer to single programme item and there be lack of comprehensive research into audience perception of bias notice an important letter in the daily telegraph on january this year from baroness deech distinguished cross bench peer and king counsel who be governor of the bbc from regard the publication of the mid term review in january she write that complaint be see by the bbc as very sensitive matter threaten the independence of the editor witness the length to which it have go to keep secret the balen report on its bias against israel she argue that the good way to handle complaint would be to appoint an independent ombudsman from outside the media industry support by expert on the topic at issue believe she be right she confirm that ofcom be heavily staff by former bbc and medium professional who may be as touchy as their current counterpart at the notion of bias at the bbc it be not just notion it be clearly apparent and that be what the public think it be also interesting to note the view of distinguished bbc insider who know how the system work on daily basis and have be openly critical of the bbc performance while they be employ as top line and experienced presenter and commentator within the bbc for decade recommend that anyone who be interested in this subject read roger mosey book get out alive which give very good insight into issue of bias by the bbc on the question of europe he recall today programme meeting when rod liddle be confront by producer who say disparagingly the eurosceptics believe germany be go to dominate europe this generate laughter from bien pensant colleague about the ridiculousness of that idea but what if it true be the response from the editor and he set the team think about item that would examine whether euroscepticism have some well found belief as member will recall at that time nobody think for minute about the simple question that those of we who be campaign on the european issue in my case have come into the house in may have campaign continuously for year be try to get across what do the european union and its related matter mean for the british people that be an example of how the system can work when reason prevail as demonstrate by the editor of the today programme mosey also refer to the issue of asylum seeker in the summer of when tony blair be prime minister mosey say that the people he describe as the editorial policy people assert in this context that the issue be be lead by an angry tabloid agenda and extreme right wing group mosey reply strongly to the editorial policy team say among other thing that the asylum debate be one in which we ve do rather badly in reflect the concern of our audience or the genuine crisis face by the government in deal with the issue that be in tony blair time let along now later he mention two year ago when it start be raise we do not realise the level of unease about the issue now two decade later the position remain the same also recommend john humphrys book day like today particularly after year of political interviewing his conclusion today presenter and their stablemate do have question to ask themselves do an interview always have to be so combative do there have to be winner or john humphrys and he know what he be talk about unlike the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant say that if it do the loser might very well be the public if we interviewer succeed albeit unintentionally in convince the listener that all politician be liar the real loser be our system of representative democracy that have serve the nation so well for so long to which say hear hear my hon friend be make very important speech would just draw the house attention to when be new young back bencher in the early and two or three of we include my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith finally get meeting with the today programme editorial team which think include rod liddle we start to explain to they why join single currency in the european union might be rather bad idea and they be very interested but they be greet with derision when they go back to the bbc and suggest that our argument should be take seriously the short answer be that we get the verdict on june as we all know the problem be that the bbc be incapable of enforce its own rule on impartiality largely because the overwhelming majority of the corporation journalist as pivotal staff as one hear even from member of this house who have work for the bbc be sign up to left liberal political worldview in which group think and wake prevail and any who diverge from the worldview they hold make those who differ from they target for criticism and bad include ridicule neither deify nor damn the bbc and like most of my constituent my household interaction be with bbc merseyside cbbc match of the day the proms and the late new drama however will say that have never work engage with or have dealing with any member of bbc staff political staff journalist who have be anything other than professional have never assume and have never ask about what their political leaning be have listen to what the hon gentleman say and respect he very much do think that we have have lot of subjective opinion and perhaps some score settling but not lot of objective evidence be most grateful to the hon gentleman for his remark will only say that as he will have notice have be quote some highly experienced knowledgeable and famous presenter and commentator who have make their own remark what the corporation desperately need be more political diversity one of the problem be the bbc hire policy which should be seek out journalist researcher and programme maker with divergent view if they be genuinely to present commentary on fair and unbiased basis despite director general tim davie avow intent to reform the bbc and maintain proper reputation for impartiality that have not happen this can be see for example by the total failure have myself mention it frequently in the press to restrain the like of gary lineker from make political statement on the issue of small boat and get away with it scot free the same apply to outrageous example of aggressive interviewing far beyond objective questioning that have recently centre on the hamas israel conflict this be the subject of an important debate lead by my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis in westminster hall only few week ago the so call thematic review publish only this week be good example of how thing be still go wrong the report claim to have consider more than output item but deliberately opt not to undertake any statistical content analysis as the bbc know only too well and as before ignore the report on the bbc coverage lead by lord wilson year ago the bbc know that real statistical analysis be require and can do so but simply refuse to provide it the licence fee be inevitably under attack as result of this failure and the loss of trust with taxpayer that go with it it be also embed be afraid in the failure have identify in the well intentione bbc mid term review itself this raise the question of why those who pay the licence fee and who feel that the bbc disregard their view and can demonstrate to have experience that should be force to pay for the running of the bbc subject upon which the wise and reasonable lord charles moore have frequently write in the past it be pleasure to follow the hon member for stone sir william cash he make wide range speech more at time perhaps suit to the history channel than to bbc parliament but be sure the view public will have listen to what he say with great interest he make some important point and the attendance at this debate do not reflect the high regard in which people hold the bbc and its importance for our nation which be why this review be of importance be not familiar with the term bbc sympathiser but suspect that many member of the public would recognise themselves as bbc sympathiser because it do hold special place in many people heart and be respect around the world that should not make the bbc immune to criticism however and because of the unique way it be fund it be often hold to high standard than many of its competitor it be right that the bbc should respond to public concern and reflect the way society be change otherwise it will find itself consign to the history book alongside silent movie and video cassette the sad reality be that the bbc traditional rival on free to air terrestrial tv be already on life support because they can not compete with online subscription service in term of quality and they can not match the way online service can target advert and reach people which be inconceivable not long ago so the bbc could become the last man stand in term of wholly british broadcaster but the warning sign be there for the bbc too recent survey find that of people do not know what the tv licence be for and agree that the tv licence should be scrap in do not agree with that but that survey should be ring alarm bell it may only be one survey and do not know the age breakdown but suspect we would find from it that young people be less likely to see the value of the licence fee after all they will have grow up in world where on demand subscription service be the norm so pay for something regardless of whether they watch it may well seem outdated and probably unfair but when we look at the hard fact not just at survey that also paint worrying picture the number of people not pay the licence fee have double in year and that be despite the threat of large fine for non payment if that non payment rate increase at the same rate over the next few decade we can all see where that will take we so we need to ask serious question about why non payment rate be grow clearly that be in part because people be vote with their foot and their wallet and that be challenge for the bbc in its override mission which will address shortly but it be also question of enforcement when ask question of ministers about enforcement action it be clear that none have be take against anyone over for non payment certainly know of constituent in that age bracket who have decide for their own reason not to pay the licence fee and so far have receive letter with various degree of threat within they but no actual enforcement action have be take it seem to that the bbc have take the decision not to prosecute for non payment certainly have no issue with that we should not be criminalise pensioner but that do jar with the other story we hear about seriously ill and vulnerable people be prosecute for non payment it seem that we be duck the hard decision that need to be make about how we deal with the licence fee be there not another issue here which be that the bbc be successful programme maker and broadcaster yet it be completely unable to compete with the like of amazon prime and netflix because it be not allow to run subscription service in the same way be there not case for replace large proportion of the licence fee income with subscription income for those programme albeit that it would still be necessary for the bbc to have some public subvention for its public service broadcasting which play such key role in our national life that be where the debate take we and that be debate we need to have we need to decide as house and country whether we think that the current model be sustainable there be evidence mount that it be not equally want to protect the bbc what be good about it and what value about it that mean that we have to face these issue not many business that decide not to charge of their customer will survive for long and people in free society should not be criminalise for refuse to pay for service that they do not use so something will have to change either the bbc will have to change tack or the government or this place will have to fill that gap if council see such level of non payment for council tax the government would be send inspector in to ask the council to deal with it we be in strange situation where we be ignore serious issue note with interest that the annual report on the licence fee produce by the bbc claim that it visit more than premise without licence but the report mysteriously fail to say what action be take as result while it be difficult to find out precisely how many home should be pay the licence fee we can state with confidence that visit be in itself small proportion of the property not currently pay the licence fee it be time for an honest debate about our expectation over people pay the licence fee the flipside of failure in licence fee collection be whether the bbc be run efficiently as an organisation it be cliché be sure we will hear plenty this afternoon that it be bureaucratic monster stuff with bbc lifer but we have to ask whether it be run effectively have be tell that six different stakeholder from four separate bbc department attend pitch for new tv series when an organisation have so many internal stakeholder we have to question who exactly they be serve those task with govern the bbc have to ask serious question of it and of themselves as to whether they be deliver true value for money in that respect will reflect on the subject of governance for moment take the point that the hon member for stone make early but come to different conclusion the debate today will clearly have large element about the bbc impartiality and do not think it be constructive for we to trade off instance where the bbc have fail in recent time to get that right we can all say that it can and must do well agree that how internal complaint be resolve need to be look at with some independent oversight however will focus on how the bbc reflect the diversity of viewpoint in its broadcasting and decision making broadcast be not just about which political party have its voice hear but who from those political party speak it seem to and my constituent that political coverage be massively dominate by voice from london that same london centric view be present through all politic coverage and frankly it play into the impression of large swathe of the country that politician be out of touch and obsess with the coming and going in westminster far remove from the reality of people life fair play to the bbc it do deign to visit the region with question time and any questions although recall recent occasion when any questions come to cheshire but the bbc still have to bus in the labour spokesperson from london it prove that you can take the bbc out of london but you can not take london out of the bbc the same apply to programme broadcast out of salford when everyone jump on the first train back to london after the show finish this be not bbc for the whole country it be bbc that be still shape by the same privately educate oxbridge london and home county viewpoint that have dominate it since its inception every member of the board that have be able to find schooling detail for be privately educate that mean there be real lack of diversity of thought and that be reflect in the make up of the senior echelon of management and editorial staff raise serious question about the bbc commitment to social mobility it be no wonder that sometimes my constituent look at the bbc and ask who be they speak to that do matter because as figure on non payment of the licence fee continue to rise the more that people feel the bbc be talk down to they and do not have voice in their community the more likely they be to join the million who have decide not to pay if we be not careful we will soon reach tipping point where the licence fee model become unsustainable as someone who actually want the bbc to survive maybe that make bbc sympathiser want this place to look seriously at how we square that circle declare an interest as licence fee payer not once but twice be sure that many other hon member who split their time between here and their constituency be as well even if be only pay it once be sure that would think it represent far bad value for money than any other tv service that pay for in term of pound per hour watch on one level that should not come as surprise pay for the subscription service do because they have thing that want to watch but could honestly say that be give free choice would pay the licence fee probably would but more and more constituent be ask that question and will continue to ask it it need serious sustainable answer do not think that the bbc can compete with on demand subscription service in term of quality or frequency of output it do some great tv but it can not compete with the investment that some of the on demand service provide be grateful for the hon gentleman indulgence he be talk about the bbc tv service but the bbc provide far more than just tv he have not mention radio think that the bbc provide some of the good radio in the world and that simply could not be provide by commercial operator do he agree that our nation be well serve by have diversity of voice from commercial provider and the bbc on the radio scene agree that bbc radio be absolutely fantastic if choose to listen to radio usually end up listen to the bbc and not just for the sport coverage but for all other coverage the bbc radio offering be probably the one part that it have get right in get good spread of voice and opinion from across the country bbc local radio be really important radio merseyside be important to great many of my constituent as my hon friend the member for st helens north conor mcginn will attest some of the cut to bbc local radio have be extremely regrettable because it be strength that we should be build on more generally it be the bbc news element be it on radio online or on tv that be critical to the bbc future while some clearly think it have bit of work to do to have everyone confidence that it be impartial it be really important to our democracy in this era of disinformation and division to have new source that be still trust by the majority of people be sure that the hon gentleman will bear in mind the extraordinary example of the bashir interview the jimmy savile scandal and the cliff richard scandal those thing that seem to envelop the bbc periodically in way that completely destroy its credibility alistair mcalpine be another example do he agree that it be astonishing that an organisation that have such reputation in certain quarter can fall down so badly in other those be some interesting historical reference any organisation that have be around as long as the bbc and with that amount of output will fall down at time however it be clear from survey about what people think about the bbc impartiality and their trust in what it broadcast that it be well ahead of anyone else that be something we need to preserve and treasure commend the work of marianna spring on the online disinformation be push by state and people who be hostile to this country and who want to sow distrust and undermine our democracy her work to expose that be vital if the bbc be to have no other role though think it should it should be trusted source of truth and transparency for everyone in this country and around the world it will have challenge persuade people that it be relevant in other area in the next few decade the majority of the population will have grow up in world where the idea of pay for service on tv set that they do not own for bunch of channel they hardly ever watch feel anachronistic at good and indefensible at worst the soon we recognise that to keep the bbc at all we need to address that challenge the soon we can decide as parliament and country that it be worth save believe that it be but we need to address the challenge before it be too late here be funny thing while have be sit here have receive text message from the bbc ask to do any questions tomorrow evening in sedbergh have have to break the news that as deputy speaker be unable to do so how peculiar that be terrible news mr deputy speaker the nation have be deprive of your view for too long and we should hear more of they congratulate my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash on secure this debate and on fascinating speech in which he adduce some interesting evidence particularly from book write by former senior bbc people he may not be shock to discover that would deduce different conclusion from much of that evidence may have misunderstood what he say about the roger mosey story of rod liddle at the today programme editorial meeting where most people around the table laugh at the idea that eurosceptics might have point but rod liddle order they to do some story about it to investigate whether it be true that seem exactly what would want the editor of the today programme to do question his own staff and perhaps his own prejudice and say okay let report wide range of view if that be what be happen that be good thing also slightly take issue with my hon friend pray in aid the thematic review of immigration that the bbc produce this week which be very self critical of some of its immigration coverage that report be commission by the bbc so that it could flagellate itself if necessary and hopefully improve its coverage that seem to be the sort of thing that would want an organisation as powerful and important as the bbc to do to retain the capacity to criticise itself suspect that he and would share the view that at time the bbc can be exasperate arrogant and wrong nevertheless as chair of the bbc all party parliamentary group believe it be one of our great national institution we should wish it success we should constantly prod it and try to improve it but in the end we should take positive view hope that my right hon friend will appreciate that my intention be to point to how statistical datum be analyse which may sound extremely boring but lie at the heart of whether we can properly evaluate the analysis in the public domain agree that there be moment when the bbc do very good thing but on some occasion it do very bad thing and there be reason for that which need proper investigation do not disagree at all there be an interesting point about statistical analysis as oppose to other qualitative perhaps more fuzzy analysis of the bbc output and performance there be clearly case for both congratulate my hon friend on the timeliness of the debate because although our benches be slightly denude today the country attention will be on the bbc over the next few day particularly on saturday night when there be two new episode of doctor who follow by eurovision on can tell hon member where the nation will be on saturday night watch the bbc it be the only institution that can do that even in the completely different medium world in which we now operate and that we all enjoy there be time when the nation come together and that will be one of they this be the second debate in row where quote former tourism minister who say that his experience of what attract people around the world to this country be three institution that they hold in the high regard the royal family the premier league and the bbc we put they in peril at our own peril as member we all inevitably have skewed perspective because we concentrate on news and current affair like everyone else here share many of the irritation and frustration sometimes shout at the tv and the radio when be at home and sometimes want to shout at the interviewer when be on tv or radio the bbc must get its news coverage right as part of its core mission on that the mid term charter review be clear it find that there be clear evidence that adherence to impartiality and editorial standard be now at the heart of the bbc priority and so it should be the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders give the impression that the bbc be die institution with few and few people watch it or listen to it however eight out of adult in this country on average consume bbc news every week that be double the figure for the next near provider at the same time this be directly relevant to the mid term charter review the bbc be overwhelmingly the uk most trusted source of news some of uk adult say they would turn first to the bbc in second place on be itv or sky regardless of the political view of the individual bbc news be more trust by people in the uk than any other institution interestingly it be also the most trust news brand in the us at time when the challenge to democracy and the capacity to have balanced debate be under threat as never before that be really important this house should acknowledge for all our frustration and irritation that we be lucky in this country to have an institution that have that reach and that level of trust and that we should therefore seek to preserve and enhance it contrast the situation with news and debate here with that in the united states where people increasingly get their news from channel that reflect the view they already have there be right wing news channel and left wing news channel in the united states therefore its political debate be polarise and increasingly toxic anything we can do in this country to avoid go down that track seem to to be very worth while it be an essential part of public service broadcasting and public service broadcasting by and large work we have talk about the change landscape and the arrival of the streamer the question be often ask who need the bbc when we have netflix prime disney apple and paramount it be good question and the answer be anyone who care about have distinctive british voice in medium drama comedy and all the thing that people want to watch the thing that unite all the stream service mention be that they come from the united states sometimes they make programme in britain we welcome they here to keep our media industry thrive but nevertheless in the end they be not go to reflect the voice of people in this country and in particular people in the part of this country that be furth away from london therefore have broadcaster whose basic role be to do that seem to to be very important the bbc contribute billion to the uk economy each year with of the gross value add generate outside london and support about job around the country again operate largely outside london we know that the creative economy be one of our strong economic sector and we know that the bbc be the large single investor in original uk content know those fact seem to again to reinforce the argument that for all of the review and investigation that need to be conduct on the whole the bbc be force for good another criticism which must be take head on concern over expansion have the bbc try to provide service that could be provide by private operator or by the market and in do so have it try to make itself too all embrace in the british medium landscape think that be permanent discussion that be well worth have it be important to ensure that the bbc be only do thing that would not be do otherwise or do thing well and in way that other would not do my hon friend the member for stone be very critical of ofcom be sometimes critical of it myself although less so than he be nevertheless it be absolutely right to identify ofcom in the era of regulation that we have enter as crucial element of ensure that the bbc stick to do what it need to be do if there be sign that ofcom be not do that job effectively this house perhaps through the culture media and sport committee will play an important role in ensure that the bbc stay on the right track the overall context of this be of course the funding settlement for the licence fee which have last for more than century now and be increasingly under threat we know about the short term pressure for reason good or bad the government have not keep the licence fee in line with inflation level over the past few year and the bbc have therefore suffer painful round of cut that have affect service that many of we value hugely such as local radio that be an important enough debate which we have have in the chamber previously but an even more important debate be this how long can licence fee settlement continue can reveal that the licence fee have survive for at least year long than some expect do some work on the licence fee and charter review and in those day the much maligned and unfairly so john birt be say that he think that it might be the last licence fee settlement because he could see what be go to happen with the internet and new mode of delivery such as video and at that time just text he think that those would ultimately render the licence fee untenable have sit through those debate in the find it fascinating that we be sit here year later still debate the same issue and that by and large the people of this country be happy to pay the licence fee although agree that an increase number be not do so give what we get for it it be still relatively cheap in comparison with the amount that many of we will spend on streaming service it have survive long than we expect but in an age of decline linear view whether it can continue be genuinely key question to those who wish to trot through the option can only commend the report that the culture media and sport committee publish few year ago hear hear be grateful for that vocal support from the opposition benches have run through the option the committee conclude that as thing stand technically it would be quite difficult to find well way of do this we all know what the imperfection be but there may not be anything well at the moment the key principle it seem to be that because everyone in the country have some stake in this perhaps financial stake everyone be in some way buy bbc service everyone be entitle to some education information or entertainment in return it be that strive to provide universal service that keep the bbc honest and keep it do the thing that only it do if we take away that obligation we may have successful programme maker but we would not keep the bbc do the thing it have do successfully for more than century often feel that the licence fee settlement work in practice but do not work at all in theory nevertheless anything that might be theoretically well might actually be bad in practice so do not envy the ministers who have to grapple with this matter it be genuinely difficult and hugely important issue to which there be no obvious answer hope that the house agree that the uk have hugely valuable asset in the bbc and that regardless of whatever change need to happen we need to preserve and enhance its ability to make significant and positive contribution to our national life that should be the test that parliament set itself when it consider the future of the bbc serve on the former digital culture media and sport committee during the last charter negotiation in and think then that the charter period of year be very long it be substantial extension although that allow the bbc to make long term decision lot change in the medium landscape in that period of time when the last charter be negotiate year ago the social medium company that dominate our medium landscape today barely exist they arrive on the scene in as major market player but be not yet what they be now the principal way in which many people access their entertainment and news look at ofcom media nations study it be clear that young viewer people under the age of increasingly look first to social medium or subscriber platform for their content rather than do what people would have do in the past which be to turn on the television and see what be on that be dramatic change in the way people consume news and information and it be not just about change in the type of content that they can access it be also about broadcast move away from true broadcast service whereby very large number of people choose to see the same thing and towards personalised service whereby the content that people consume be design around they and their viewing habit that apply to news just as much as it do to any other form of content that be the very big change that we have see and the prospect of artificial intelligence reduce the cost of production particularly for news content will only accelerate the process the shift in people habit towards consume medium through online platform and social medium app will accelerate the personalisation of the content they see in fact such tool have be design precisely to achieve that end as ever my hon friend who have enormous experience of all this will add lot to this debate he mention what be do some year ago compare with now have he be watch bbc four repeat of the entire civilisation series by kenneth clark do he not think that it be one of the most remarkable example of what the bbc can do fantastically well and that people should be watch it now that be not bad plug for the series agree with my hon friend if may briefly digress on his theme once host an event in parliament for the royal television society at which that programme be discuss it be say that commission budget and commission editor behave very differently in the past and that david attenborough commission the entire series without have to ask for the director general opinion he just do part epic of factual content alan clark father kenneth clark open the civilisation series by ask what be civilisation he say do think can define it but think recognise it when see it sometimes think that the debate about whether the bbc be distinctive enough and what distinctiveness look like at the bbc be rather the same it be hard to define but we think we recognise it when we see it the reason want to open my remark by talk about the change nature of view habit and of the medium and the fact that it would have seem impossible year ago that the centrality of broadcaster such as the bbc could be challenge by service such as youtube be that it be change view habit too the one big difference between the charter negotiation in and the build up to the new charter which will come into effect in be that those change habit be lead licence fee payer to make different choice increasingly they be choose not to pay this be the great challenge we now face in the past the bbc have to ward off government that seek to load substantial extra cost on to it without compensate with large increase in the licence fee we previously see that with the cost of the world service and then free licence for the this time around the bbc face the challenge of potentially decline licence fee revenue alongside the reluctance of consumer to pay much more than they be be ask to pay now it be doubtful that licence fee payer would support substantial increase to the licence fee and do not think either the government or the opposition would be incline to do it the bbc will therefore have to continue challenge itself to consider how it can prioritise resource while maintain its core principle which believe be fundamental to the bbc that it be publicly fund and universal service in which there be something for everyone who pay into it the challenge of how to deliver that in the modern era require the bbc to look for alternative form of revenue in many way the big change in the last charter renewal empower the bbc to develop the commercial potential of bbc studios in the director general recent speech be pleased to hear that he have set target to increase those revenue to over billion within the charter period bbc studios would then bring in very substantial part of the bbc revenue make more programme for more people and sell they around the world be an excellent way for the bbc to make money but we also have to consider how it can monetise its current programme in the pre internet world people would watch programme they like and they could watch it again when it be repeat some say that it would be repeat too often but it would be repeat if they wish to own it so that they could watch it on demand as we now say they could buy cassette or dvd in shop think programme should be free to air on service such as iplayer for period of time but do they really need to be free for year should there not be point at which the bbc start to charge people to watch on demand just as any other subscription platform would the same go for audio content the bbc have try to take big position in the podcast market although it have be very effectively challenge by new entrant that be produce programme of the same quality as radio on wide range of topic and attract very big audience again think those programme should be free to air and available to all but should access to the full archive remain free forever or should there be charge it be perfectly legitimate for the bbc to consider such commercial revenue in the same way as it sell book dvd and cd in the past these be way in which the bbc can seek to bring in more revenue to reinvest in the programming that it need to make the bbc also need to consider the distinctiveness of its local newsgathering this be very important part of the bbc service think most member be concerned about the apparent dilution of investment in local radio which be an area where the bbc can deliver something in way that no one else be deliver it think there should be increase investment these be often among the bbc service that local audience value most and be not sure those local audience would have make some of the investment decision that the bbc have make the breadth of service that the bbc offer have change dramatically throughout its history it may well be that the bbc need to consider whether to prioritise certain service over other while still remain universal broadcaster because it may not be able to deliver the breadth that it deliver now while maintain the quality standard it wish to maintain these be go to be very important consideration in term of distinctiveness would like to see the bbc take creative risk it can afford to take creative risk because it be not reliant on advertising revenue to fund its programming hold an audience at certain level throughout the day might be demonstration of universal appeal but it be not commercial necessity for the bbc because it be not dependent on advertising revenue it be fair criticism to say be the service on the bbc schedule particularly the daytime one distinct from what we would see on other channel we largely see the same menu and diet of quiz antique and property show which although popular be widely available could the bbc afford to take more risk and be more distinctive there the principle of the bbc be publicly fund be important an aspect of this debate that be not mention enough be that under the alternative where we say to the bbc that we want it to be voluntary subscription service the volume of those subscription be almost certain to add up to less than we be talk about for the licence fee today we would therefore have much small bbc largely make programme for small group of subscriber who wish to pay that would be gross act of vandalism against an important national institution if we have fully commercial bbc with full advertising the big loser would be the other commercial broadcaster itv and channel they would discover that the revenue pot from advertiser for live tv audience in the uk be not infinite and the bbc would simply be soak it up we would weaken our creative sector and our television market in the uk by do that we can not disturb one part of the ecosystem of great success british television and film production without disturb the other component part of it that be why the bbc remain publicly fund be important although the mechanism have to be open to challenge as the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders say young viewer in particular see the licence fee as type of subscription no matter how the bbc want to see it in effect people see this as monthly charge they pay just as they might pay for amazon prime or for netflix they do not understand it as device levy if they be watch tv through computer or on their laptop it might be that the bbc will have to be fund in different way be it property base tax as have be discuss before by the select committee and be the case in germany or some other mechanism if the bbc be fund publicly in that way it be perfectly legitimate to say what amount what proportion of that funding should be contestable to what extent should another free to air broadcaster or even subscriber broadcaster such as sky be able to come along and say we will make this instead we will make it well and we will make it free to air what proportion of that revenue should be contestable in that way there will be legitimate debate on that but open this up too widely would make the bbc sustainability difficult to protect as we look forward to the end of this charter and the start of the new one we face lot of challenge on get this funding mechanism right it need to give the bbc the revenue and flexibility it need to do what we want it to do it need to be fund through charging mechanism that make sense to the public we also have to consider the viability of other service such as the bbc world service which be of huge strategic value to the uk but be largely fund by licence fee payer now we must consider the extent to which there should be government support for that particularly in respect of service that be far afield in closing just wish to say that regard the bbc as vital national institution in world that be become more fractured and where audience be more scatter the role of trust national broadcaster that can be impartial although that will always be open to challenge from people who hold different view that be resolutely focus on try to get to the truth and that can be trusted source of news and information in world rive by disinformation conspiracy theory and lie be of the utmost importance as my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green say national broadcaster can put on those moment that bring the nation together be it royal wedding royal funeral or the coronation eurovision or major sporting event at such time the nation can come together and the bbc become the national town square that be fundamental part of its role in our public life let start by congratulate my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash on secure this important debate class myself as critical friend of the bbc be not sure whether that make sympathiser or not want to see the bbc prosper in the new medium age but that inevitably mean we will see change at the bbc in response to the global creative boom we be witness as my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green say we should not underestimate the soft power involve here the selling of uk plc around the world by the bbc and its work however we simply can not expect the british public to accept an ever increase licence fee if they perceive the value and approach of the bbc to be out of kilter with their world my constituent tell that they value the bbc they value british public service broadcaster particularly for news and current affair but it seem that the bbc do not value the type of news and current affair that my constituent want particularly around local news it be disappointing that the one area where the bbc can genuinely make difference local provision have be the area that have be cut and withdraw in recent month my constituent be concern about opinion that be present as fact they want creativity and innovation but they want to see the world through eye that be from their local area they want to see their town or their street reflect on the screen or hear through the speaker of their bbc radio station its good and most distinctive content be unrivalle in range and quality while be highly value by listener and viewer some of its service and programme would simply not be possible to provide on commercial basis as say early in response to the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders service like radio simply would not exist in the commercial marketplace the majority of my remark will pick up on the comment make by my right hon friend the member for ashford about what the bbc should be do as we move forward post the mid term review and think about the next licence fee settlement the mid term review provide valuable insight into the bbc governance and regulation arrangement and whether they have successfully enable and effectively deliver the bbc mission and public purpose particularly welcome the mid term review agreement with ofcom and the recommendation to change the framework agreement so that new bbc service be not automatically consider material change there be lot of value in ofcom publicise an annual view on the bbc position in the local news sector and set out its approach to consider the competition impact of change to bbc local news service particularly in relation to the local press which be struggle significantly the bbc decision to move more of its resource online have consequence and impact local journalism that be support by advertising for ofcom should take serious interest in that ofcom have say it will set out view for the first time in november and subsequently use its annual report on the bbc to update its view particularly welcome that will take few moment to specifically look at the competition and market impact in relation to the audio and radio sector for context let we start by look at the audience of bbc radio the combined weekly audience for all bbc and commercial radio in the uk remain extremely healthy some million people represent of the population put their radio on every week to listen to linear service in the last quarter of the most recent figure publish by radio joint audience research bbc radio share of total listening be one operator have of the radio listen market that remain significant dominant position the remain be split between myriad much small commercial operator the bbc hold an extremely privileged position because of the scale of funding it receive its unrivalled broadcast network and its ability to cross promote its service the like of which be not available to any rival operator be that in television radio or online advocate change to the bbc trust back in the early but it be fair to say that there have be relatively light touch approach to define and police the activity of the bbc that most closely resemble the commercial sector in the radio and audio world traditionally this have include the main pop music service radio and radio but the bbc be also increasingly leverage its position in radio and audio into its online activity provide on the bbc sounds platform this debate provide with an opportunity to highlight the current process of consultation over the launch of new service on all platform include bbc sounds as well as the effectiveness of regulation and governance from ofcom in ensure its distinctiveness specifically the review look at how the bbc and ofcom assess the market impact and public value of the bbc in an evolve marketplace and how this relate to the wide uk medium ecology include with regard to commercial radio and local news sector and other content maker and distributor it be important that regulatory condition for bbc radio service be not dilute and that the drive for the bbc to deliver distinctive output remain the bbc have be repeatedly and rightly criticise by ofcom for not meet the require standard of openness with stakeholder especially when new service be be develop early detail that more structured consultation be require which be what ofcom be urge the bbc to do the current framework place too much emphasis on the bbc own judgment and assessment of impact especially when consider the significance of change to its own service this undermine the credibility and independence of the process ofcom can and should do more to make sufficiently robust assessment of competitive impact and need to set out clear and more consistent requirement for the bbc the extent of the bbc significant dominance in sector such as radio and the implication of this for both distinctiveness and market impact must be reflect more clearly bbc service must be measure and hold to account to the high possible standard of distinctiveness just last week when meet people from the bbc ask for some datum relate to digital audience the reply receive be that they would be publish they annually that be simply not good enough in february the bbc announce plan to launch new spin off radio station on dab and bbc sounds which would directly imitate radio service provide currently by the independent radio sector my view be that these new service be duplicate and they fail to deliver distinctive output to listener already concern about change to their beloved bbc local radio service the change require regulatory approval from ofcom and have raise my concern directly with the minister and the regulator be concerned that the bbc be attempt to fast track proposal on bbc sounds which be subject to less regulatory oversight than the dab service as listening habit continue to shift online there be real risk of harm to popular and innovative commercial station develop across the uk station such as boom radio have move in to deliver popular service for the when radio move its service to young age group if this service be launch exclusively on bbc sounds and it inevitably receive significant cross promotion on bbc and on radio it will drive audience and can impact commercial operator significantly in march the bbc confirm new plan for the first time in the uk to run advertising around its podcast and on demand content on third party platform such as the apple podcast app if these proposal be introduce listener who do not use bbc sounds would in effect be pay twice for bbc content they have already pay their licence fee which have contribute to make the content but then they will be pay again through advertising revenue the bbc be unfairly force licence fee payer to pick between ad free listening on bbc sounds or their preferred podcast platform listener should be entitle to access bbc audio content such as desert island discs via whatever mean they choose although the podcast advertising market be in its relative infancy the bbc be dominant in uk audio which be different from the tv market and as result its impact could and probably will be significant there be only limited pool of audio advertising revenue as my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins reference with commercial audio broadcaster rely solely on that revenue to fund their service and invest in professional content ironically there be risk that the new proposal will have an unintended consequence for the bbc as we look at the future of the licence fee observer may reasonably question if some bbc audio service could be fund by advertising why not do that to all their radio provision or to the bbc as whole analysis conduct by an audio think tank have already identify that be that to be the case probably only radio and radio would continue to be fund because they be the only service that would be commercially viable be very supportive of public funding for the bbc under the current licence fee model simply because do not think that suitable alternative could be propose at this stage give what believe to be the unworkable nature of alternative such as subscription model for dab or fm audio we simply can not allow anybody to railroad we into scrap the licence fee at this stage support the government aim of ensure that strong distinctive independent bbc can continue to thrive for year to come also want we to take opportunity to improve the bbc where we can my hope be that the mid term review be staging post in the charter that will help the bbc to live up to that ambition support the corporation to fly the flag for britain in all corner of the world and address the risk that the bbc which be not regulate and focus on distinctive content risk the very future of public service broadcasting and innovation within the independent creative sector we now come to the front bench contribution the last two minute will be for sir bill to wind up when the mid term review of the bbc be publish one commentator describe it publicly as great big hard hammer badly disguise inside not very velvet glove use to batter this key public institution there be much criticism of the report over the bbc perceive failure to achieve balanced coverage the sight of some right wing conservative attack the bbc over its record on impartiality be something to behold many hound bbc journalist over objectivity yet the conservatives be happy for their benches to operate as sort of green room for gb news with half dozen or so tory member pop up there regularly masquerade as journalist ofcom the regulator have explicitly condemn gb news and its tory mp presenter over their continue breaking of our broadcasting rule the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg moonlight as newsreader daily on gbeebies clear breach of ofcom rule which the regulator be sadly too weak to enforce work for the bbc for many year as freelancer most bbc journalist sincerely believe try to be fair and impartial they sometimes fall short think they do so during the independence referendum not individual journalist but the bbc as an institution because the bbc be deeply establishment as an institution do not believe for one moment that journalist go to work daily with the objective of spread disinformation the hon member for stone sir william cash cite as an example of wake europhile bias the view of brexiter rod liddle who be this lowly figure when at the bbc in fact he hold the powerful role of the today programme editor the hon member for stone mention roger mosey another junior figure no he be also the today programme editor who become head of news set aside the surreal comparison that the hon member for stone make between the cost of the bbc and westminster that be westminster one two three and four radio westminster and natural westminster history presumably he move on to some more bbc wake bash conveniently forget that the current bbc director general be conservative party candidate the last bbc chair be major tory donor and the last chair but two be now tory peer like lord grade lord patten et cetera et cetera in my position on the culture media and sport committee regularly aim to hold bbc boss to account over their party political loyalty their judgment and their treatment of staff that be all part of healthy democratic critique this government or any government that hold office in this place should back public broadcasting as basic fundamental concept and celebrate the bbc for its many present and past achievement while of course remain critical friend the constant baiting of the bbc during these last year by so many senior conservative have give we sadly weak public broadcaster on shoogli financial footing with less positive impact on our democracy than when the conservatives come to power think the hon gentleman have slightly misinterpret what say and be on the verge of be misleading happen to think ron liddle be an exceptionally good presenter as be roger mosey and john humphrys but their experience demonstrate degree of awareness that all be not necessarily well in the organisation or the manner in which their programme be put together that be all be say be not criticise they be commend they hold the front page the hon gentleman think that right wing brexiters be fundamentally good thing when they appear on the bbc that be shock to we all be it not agree with the right hon member for ashford damian green who he say that the recitation by the hon member for stone of the event of one particular editorial meeting show journalist office operating well somebody say something controversial other folk argue and we all have what be it mrs merton right good debate remember when sit with the right hon member for surrey heath michael gove and various other on on the record we be all reporter and we all hold very different view but we do our very good to make sure we be impartial when on air that be just as it should be the conservatives spend good deal of time argue that the licence fee should rise only with inflation then when they trash the economy and inflation rocket they demand that the bbc not increase the licence fee with inflation lead to further financial pressure the government also impose social responsibility tv licence for the on the bbc lead to widely predict set of draconian cut much faux surprise and outrage ensue from some on the tory benches those measure have have huge negative impact on our public broadcaster which we as state have be build now for more than century an underfunded bbc suit none of we because the bbc role in provide scrutiny for politician especially in an election year be vital reform of the bbc be certainly need pay equality for woman more black asian and minority ethnic staff in senior management post and more lgbt people in management and elsewhere the bbc need to end its fruitless battle with female staff have lose or settle every single pay case it have fight against those woman at huge cost have see two tory bbc chair improperly appoint and force to resign in the last decade we surely need new system for public service appointment we will have labour government soon will we see the same old british principle of buggins turn with labour donor replace tory donor in senior post the leader of the opposition should rule out the appointment of any big money donor as bbc chair notice he have conspicuously fail to do so now would be good time to promise meaningful reform congratulate the hon member for stone sir william cash on give we this opportunity to discuss the bbc he bring up the concept of bbc sympathy virtually everybody in the chamber in fact think literally everybody include he have express at least some bbc sympathy in this debate that be testimony to the fact that member with all sort of view on the bbc future past and present have manage to find something they love about the bbc my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders recognise for instance the value of radio which be mention by the hon member for warrington south andy carter my hon friend also rightly raise concern about the bbc future and speak about the possible implication of different funding option he demonstrate that he value it as trust news source and mention that that must continue but without proper funding arrangement it could be weaken value his contribution the right hon member for ashford damian green give thorough review of the importance of the bbc to our national life our economy our role in the world he make powerful argument about the way in which funding option have hitherto affect the bbc output he mention in particular the radio output as have other the concern have be raise by many member include some who be not here today that the cut and change to local radio for whatever reason have have an effect future proposal may as the hon member for warrington south say have an effect on competition concern about that have be raise with he as well as with my hon friend the member for barnsley east stephanie peacock who have be take radio station view on the proposal think it right that we consider the effect on competition the unintended consequence as the hon member for warrington south say the hon member for folkestone and hythe damian collins have be distinguished member of the culture media and sport committee over the past year we have many former member of that committee here even in our low number and they bring such expertise he give detailed description of the implication of different form of widen revenue urge all member look at the different funding option to read the hansard report of this debate because member have make great contribution with thought and care the hon member for warrington south describe himself as critical friend of the bbc think that be an apt way to describe himself because he raise concern about competition and new proposal while also share what he believe to be unique and distinctive about the bbc it be worth spend small amount of time on what be unique and distinctive about the bbc member have mention radio and podcast would add bbc bitesize which so many young people rely on during the lockdown year we have the bbc website how many member be get bbc news alert pop up on their screen right now that be so often our method for learn about something that have just happen we use it to check the weather in the morning or to listen back to something that we have miss during the day but which we find really valuable the content that the bbc be able to put out because of the role we entrust it with unique role in our public life be what make it such great public service broadcaster as the secretary of state write in her foreword to the bbc mid term charter review the bbc be an unmatched medium institution that matter deeply to this country and to people right across the world agree the government have an important role in both scrutinise and champion the bbc but the secretary of state and some of her colleague have have an odd way of show it gently suggest to the minister that the government need to focus on support the bbc to fulfil its public service broadcasting mission rather than use it as punch bag as so many conservative members many of whom be not here today have do consistently in recent year will underline the importance of the bbc to our national life before address the mid term review itself the bbc be one our great institution it bring wealth job and joy alongside other public service broadcaster it bring people together for share experience as many right hon and hon member have say from sporting occasion to royal occasion we be all there most people turn to the bbc in the last few hour of the late queen life but we also turn to it for great moment of rejoice when our new king be crown so recently the bbc bring together people from the world over in news output which be particularly recognise and trust as the right hon member for ashford say the bbc be an important part of our soft power but it be also vital in the ecosystem of our creative industry it contribute billion to the uk economy every year of which be outside london many member would argue that that percentage should be high and we will hold the bbc to its plan to take more investment outside london carefully have see the benefit of that for myself in my constituency of bristol west which be home to the bbc world renowne natural history unit it be not just about the natural history unit itself but the clustering of creative industry that have develop around it with independent production company flourish the bbc be the single large investor in original uk content create job but also help we to tell our national story in distinctive british way that be the first be the british broadcasting corporation it be not anything else but british and it keep british life front and centre salute the bbc for its desire to improve and innovate and to widen its range of content the hon member for stone talk about diversity of view and believe that that be already with we we have diversity of output of regional output of regional voice and of story tell but every member should always challenge the bbc to go far on that because champion diversity of view be one of the thing we be here to do in our role as mps however the bbc be now compete for our attention with global medium conglomerate that be motivate by profit rather than by public service those be different function those include streaming service but also content across social medium so it be important that we support and work with the bbc to change with the time as well as challenge it to do so we need to make sure it get the support it need of course the bbc need modern governance framework that be robust proportionate and fit for purpose the introduction of the unitary board to govern the bbc and the regulation of the bbc by ofcom be both new element in the charter review that review include focus on governance and regulatory issue and therefore the bbc mission public purpose and funding model be write out of the scope of this mid term review the government choose to focus on six theme the first be editorial standard and impartiality which many member have address today and the second be the handling of complaint have to mention to the hon member for stone that just because complaint with which he sympathise be not uphold it do not mean that the regulator be wrong he pose an interesting argument that large volume of complaint not be uphold mean that the complaint system be not good enough the minister may wish to address that point in her remark the other theme be competition and market impact commercial governance and regulation diversity and transparency overall the finding of the review indicate that the bbc governance and regulation be work well it say that that be particularly true of the bbc commercial activity something that be worth note welcome the review recommendation to push the bbc to continue make improvement in relation to diversity diversity of view of voice and of identity and transparency if be the next secretary of state for culture media and sport will continue to push the bbc to do so the bbc have make clear commitment in both those area and be make progress towards meet those commitment but there can never be room for complacency in any creative organisation will always hold the bbc to account it take public money to do the work that it do and represent the wide diversity of voice be so important as other member have say it be right that ofcom should assess the impact of the bbc decision on the wide market but it should also be note that of all materiality assessment review by ofcom since the start of this charter period it have dispute only one it be also right that the bbc have clear easy to understand and robust complaint process that be why the principle of bbc first be introduce in so that licence fee payer can hold the bbc directly accountable it be important to be guide by evidence of course it be right that the bbc be impartial and that there be process for assess that impartiality that be the only way in which the bbc will remain the uk most trusted source of news and some would claim the world most trusted source it should therefore be note that ofcom have uphold only one complaint against the bbc regard impartiality in the eight year since the beginning of this charter it be important that member of all view recognise the role of the mid term charter review but also the work that government of all colour will need to do in context of rise disinformation and misinformation spread by highly sophisticated state and non state actor and in year in which the citizen of so many country be take to the poll our public service broadcaster could not be more precious our democracy be the rich for it the information that the mid term review gather on the public perception of the bbc be also evidence it be evidence of what the public think about the bbc that be fundamentally important and my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and neston raise that in reflect the view of his own constituent the bbc spend year build trust and it can not stop now and it can not take its reputation for grant believe it be do neither believe it be work hard to move forward but it will always be hold to account the next charter review will hope take place under labour government and we will work constructively with the bbc to make sure it be fit for the century it will be inform by the bbc big ever public engagement exercise which will begin next year it will be inform by an understanding of the great contribution the bbc make to storytelle british storytelling as well as to the growth of the creative industry in the uk and its unique role in bring community together most importantly it will be inform by true appreciation of the value of source of both entertainment and news that we can trust thank all hon member who have contribute to what have be genuinely interesting and rich discussion congratulate my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash on secure this important debate on our mid term review of the bbc as approach my birthday in just under four week time would rather be celebrate his anniversary as parliamentarian which pass only day ago he will be retire from this place when the general election come call leave behind four decade of service to our nation and legacy of relentless campaigning the crown achievement of which will be his effort to restore sovereignty to this place he have be parliamentarian of substance and impact and parliamentarian who have understand his fundamental role which be first and foremost to serve the people and interest of this our great nation one of my hon friend technique as relentless campaigner hope he will not mind my saying this be lie in wait for ministers and pounce on they with surprising agility for an octogenarian in darken corridor or vote lobby to advance the cause close to his heart so it have be that on many occasion we have discuss bbc impartiality of course his interest in this subject extend well beyond my three year as media minister he reference and because it be cause he have champion for decade why because as he imply it go to the heart of the special contract between the british people and the bbc that the bbc will be fund in unique way via the licence fee because it have unique duty in how it cover national event produce content report on and shape public debate and imbue the british value of fairness free speech and rigour into the bbc world service as an international projection of our nation as my hon friend reflect in debate last month he play an important role in put the issue of bbc impartiality at the centre of the current charter regret that he will not be here in the next parliament with his institutional knowledge when new generation of mps will need to make some very big decision about the future of the bbc as its next royal charter be draw up the foundation for which we be lay now the mid term review have be one of the staging post to that moment and it will be huge moment for uk broadcaster audience and creator because the world be change around we and change very rapidly the question that have preoccupy public debate on the bbc future the most be the sustainability of the licence fee which have be mention several time be in no doubt but that that will be big part of the discussion on the charter renewal the number pay the licence fee be fall whether or not people be advocate of it the way audience particularly young audience consume content be break their traditional relationship with the linear broadcaster weaken the loyalty to and the love of the institution audience feel that the bbc be not adequately reflect they as have also be touch on as consequence they have lose trust in it and be start to not want to pay the licence fee the fact that most television will be receive over the internet will introduce new gatekeeper and promoter of content and none of we quite know how ai will shape the information industry the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders speak about these challenge with great clarity as do my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins who bring his considerable expertise to this debate before turn in more detail to the mid term review my ask of this house if may make one as we debate the bbc in the come month and year be that we do not lose focus on the very big picture as we fret over the urgent or everyday matter surround the bbc its coverage and its presenter since the second world war we have understand our country and its value in part through the strength of its great institution as be mention by my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green the bbc be surely one of they but it be not enough simply to will it to have future and expect that to be the case as the world change around we those institution whose strength we have perhaps complacently rely upon must go through process of renewal renewal that provide clarity of purpose and sense of mission for the next decade of the century and dare say it that include the conservative party and renewal of centre right thinking in the bbc case that mission must surely include the vigorous pursuit of truth in world in which information and fact be blur with increase sophistication and intent it must not just provide audience with narrow diet of content that suit an individual taste or cater to their own worldview but challenge inform educate and provoke curiosity in way that pull people out of their silo and in way that serve all audience but especially our child as counter to malign element of the online world and the pull of addictive entertainment over nourish educational content that help they navigate the real world around they as this house have make patently clear that include local audience and my hon friend the member for warrington south andy carter have campaign particularly strongly on that one of the most interesting part of the director general recent speech about the future of the bbc be about algorithm which be design by many organisation to monetise controversy he set out how the bbc in the century be develop unique ethical algorithm that do not simply double down on an individual narrow preference but guide they into broad rich catalogue and bring people together at charter renewal there might also be interesting question about how we can well create and deliver public service content if young audience be move elsewhere and about whether wide range of outlet and creator be well place to deliver that my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe touch on that we will need to look at the bbc world service as force for project our value globally as malign state seek rapidly to up the stake in the battle for heart and mind finally there will be important question about the bbc vital role in feed the wide broadcasting and creative ecology in way that will allow we in the uk to continue as world leader in creativity and to retain our cultural voice that be an aspect of the bbc debate that be often overlook or misunderstood when we discuss its value it have lead the director general to describe the bbc as growth and innovation fund for the uk to back british storytelling the mid term review touch on some of these issue but it should be see as the staging post that it be new innovation introduce at the last charter to understand whether the bbc be operate in the way envisage at the last charter review but also to signal where we think thing may need to change by understand that for some member my hon friend the member for stone include the mid term review do not go far enough on issue close to their heart and want gently to challenge that view the mid term review deliver number of significant and necessary reform focus on editorial standard and impartiality whether the bbc have the right complaint model and the distinctiveness of the bbc content in relation to competition and market impact want to be clear that the discussion within the mid term review with the bbc and ofcom lead by my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state result in recommendation she get over the line with the licence fee payer always at front of mind our review be unambiguous that there be scope for material improvement across variety of area and it make recommendation for meaningful change as my hon friend the member for stone have previously mention impartiality be at the heart of the mid term review and we conclude that it continue to be major challenge for the bbc follow direct and constructive dialogue with we in government the bbc be implement major reform build on the serota review and that include thematic review of output most recently we see one this week on migration coverage key feature of the mid term review be the recommendation for ofcom regulatory responsibility include its oversight of due impartiality to be extend to key area of the bbc online public service material which be where many now go for their content the bbc also have an important tool at its disposal in its effort to continue build trust in its relationship with its audience and that be the complaint process as member will know the bbc be unique among broadcaster in have the chance indeed the responsibility to try and resolve audience complaint about its content first before they be consider by the independent regulator ofcom the ongoing feedback of licence fee payer to the bbc and how that feedback flow directly to staff and programme maker be invaluable in help the bbc understand what its audience care about and how to make its service well we have hear concern through the mtr about complaint and that be why they form key focus of our review and it be the area where we make the most recommendation recognise the strength of feeling among some member for those colleague fundamental question remain about the appropriateness of the bbc first principle and that be why at charter review we have commit to examine whether bbc first remain the right complaint model to enable the bbc to deliver against its responsibility to serve all audience my hon friend the members for warrington south andy carter and for folkestone and hythe damian collins talk about the bbc role in the market and the impact on commercial competitor and that be also raise in the mid term review the charter do not preclude the bbc have an adverse impact on the market if the bbc and ofcom believe that be necessary for the effective fulfilment of the bbc mission and public purpose we talk extensively with industry during the review and we find that lack of effective engagement have the potential to risk the bbc and ofcom decision make process we be clear that the bbc need to drive high standard for that holder engagement and transparency so that business operate in the same market can be support we have therefore make recommendation to ensure that the bbc strengthen that engagement with competitor in the medium in particular that should include commercial radio station and local newspaper especially when it make decision that impact they while the mid term review will deliver material improvement in the bbc governance and regulation reiterate that it be only one part of the government ongoing programme of work to scrutinise the bbc with more to come as we move towards charter review this will be significantly broad process than the mid term review consider what the bbc be for and how it be fund that be why before charter review the next major step in our roadmap be the funding model review over its year history the bbc have prove to be one of the most adaptable innovative and thinking medium organisation on our planet across time the bbc have show its ability to open itself up to external scrutiny reflect on challenge and find learn opportunity we trust it will do so again absorb the finding of the mid term review and improve its structure and process not as an end in itself but to maintain the support of audience and underline its purpose for truth telling and trust we all rely on the bbc be the good it can be and we need to set the foundation for its renewal in the century as vital british institution not to protect the institution for its own sake but because its purpose of truth seek and have the high quality content have be renew and accept as vital by the people and the nation we be elect here to serve may commend the minister not only on her speech just now but on have continually engage with on the subject over the past few year she have be dedicate to her task and do not come at this debate with rose tint spectacle have be critical of the bbc and will continue to be so on the term express be glad to note that she have say that the government believe as the term review say that there be room for improvement that improvement be in part to do with attitude and with statistical analysis and datum and set all that out in my speech it be also to do with the group think that still gravitate in certain cohort at the bbc and ofcom but have make my point on that and it be on the record accept entirely that this organisation which have be go for so long have an incredibly important role to play in our national life it be precisely because it impinge day by day hour by hour on our opinion thought and attitude that it be so important that impartiality be sustain in the correct manner and by reference to criterion it should not be judge and jury as baroness deech say in her letter in the daily telegraph on january this year the bbc require great degree of independence and she even refer to an independent ombudsman be not satisfied the figure have give perhaps illustrate it well and there be lack of sufficient proof that the ecu system be work as well as some people hop have deep misgiving about it as have express the proof of the pudding be in the eating and these improvement hope as result of this debate will be examine in that light simply say this to my hon friend on the government side and to those on the opposition side some of whom be somewhat more critical about what have have to say than other pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green and my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins recognise that they really know what they be talk about and have enormous experience of these matter this have be an important debate be sorry that the odd colleague who sign my application to the backbench business committee have not be here today their presence would have be lovely but to some degree it reflect the difficult few week we have have but notwithstanding that be glad that we have have the debate be extremely grateful to the minister for her response and to the other member who participate the debate have be more than worthwhile and be another landmark in consider the improvement that we can achieve in relation to the bbc in the future suspect that like many of you have watch the eurovision song contest for many decade with bated breath expectation and hope we wish graham norton well as he front the show this weekend and we wish olly alexander incredibly well we all hope that he will win if any of you be free that night mr fletcher the government whip tell that he be have eurovision song contest party at his house as will many people throughout the country good luck everybody on that contest question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the bbc mid term charter review petition recommendations of the infected blood inquiry more than nine year ago share with the house the story of mrs lesley hughes who finally discover in that she have be infect with hepatitis back in by an nhs blood transfusion after serious road traffic accident for she and other severely affect constituent present this the late in long series of similar petition from all over the united kingdom the petition of mrs diana brooks and other state the petition of resident of the constituency of new forest east declare that people who receive infected blood and who have suffer as consequence have along with their family wait far too long for redress the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to implement the recommendation in the second interim report of the infected blood inquiry without delay and the petitioner remain etc local government official bullying motion make and question propose that this house do now fletcher rise to consider the potential merit of government measure to tackle the bullying of local government official this short debate seek to explore the government plan properly to provide for enforcement of the code of conduct applicable to parish and town councillor give the amount of bullying and intimidation experience by local council clerk far too many town and parish council clerk face regular intimidation by minority of councillor and there be at present insufficient enforcement mechanism and penalty to resolve the issue good people be resign as result the turnover rate for clerk be far great than the average for most comparable form of employment an article in the telegraph online on october state that preliminary academic survey of town and parish council find that over half have experience behavioural issue from councillor include bullying and disrespect towards other representative or clerk the finding also show an imminent loss of expertise amid shortage of young clerk there be at least three important organisation with strong view about this worrying situation the association of local council clerks the national association of local councils and the society of local council clerks they be not unanimous in their recommendation but they all recognise the reality of the crisis all three have have constructive conversation with my staff and in recent month for which be very grateful the slcc have state of parish council experience serious behaviour issue be effectively dysfunctional as result of they that figure obviously vary to degree over time but the alcc have recently indicate that it consider the problem to be worsen rather than improve have be provide with deeply disturbing first hand testimony of inappropriate behaviour by small percentage of council member it may only be one or two individual on any give council but the effect of their behaviour on the clerk other councillor and other staff can be unbearable it can easily cause breakdown in health and subsequent departure from much value career clerk often feel that their job be at risk unless they carry out the wish of individual councillor even though the councillor in question may be try to act outside the legislative requirement thus force the clerk to act illegally be advise that many clerk fear for their job on daily basis in my view much of the problem arise from the lack of an independent body to oversee councillor behaviour and to impose sufficient penalty to discourage such behaviour when it occur sufficient code of conduct be in place for councillor they be usually clear unambiguous and base on the nolan principle but their enforcement and the imposition of appropriate penalty when their provision be break be sadly miss the standard board be abolish in and the current system of local authority staff enforcement via monitor officer do not work as effectively as would an independent system in may it be confirm that nationally there be an excessive turnover of monitor officer that be hardly surprising give that they have to take action in quasi judicial role sometimes against their own councillor who be their employer at principal authority level while those councillor also possibly sit on town or parish council too as mention it be not only staff but other councillor who find themselves be bully shall not identify any specific council or individual in this speech yet know of one case where several councillor resign during three year period because of bully by the chairman of that council in separate case two councillor be call upon to step down after their attempt to bully the council clerk out of her job be prove third council be plunge into disarray after eight member resign amid claim of bullying harassment and abuse and the town clerk also resign at the same time and for the same reason there be very many specific example which could be cite because such misconduct have become so common as almost to be routine on the part of really small but poisonous minority of councillor of course the vast majority of councillor neither accept nor condone such terrible behaviour but they do not have the necessary mean to deal effectively with the disruptor and the bully motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now fletcher here be one scenario post on the internet by despairing councillor we have parish councillor who continually harass the clerk out of hour at home and by email about pretty well everything the clerk do the clerk be respectful knowledgeable and more than capable but this individual say to the chairman can question the clerk because be parish councillor we have lose three clerk in less than three year because of this dreadful man and fear we be go to lose this one give finding such as the academic survey mention early this be clearly situation that must not be allow to continue apart from the impropriety aspect the turnover of staff cause by bully be economically damaging lead to severe loss of efficiency in the affect parish and town council then there be the additional recruitment and training cost for those council which lose their clerk through resignation several council have also be take to court for constructive dismissal claim relate to harassment once again this would be much less likely to arise if there be proper regulation and proper enforcement be really grateful to the right hon gentleman for bring forward this debate have long term interest in look at workplace bully across the piece and be bring forward private member bill on june to ensure we have legal definition for bullying which we currently do not have in our suite of legislation hope he will be able to support the bill but beyond that we must ensure there be route to an employment tribunal so that people be protect at work would he be minded to work with and support that and to find the mechanism to put positive behaviour into all workplace this be the first have hear about the hon lady initiative it sound absolutely admirable and would be very interested in support her effort particularly commend the idea of clear and legal definition of bullying because we all know that there be sometimes subjective approach to the subject where even word of legitimate criticism be interpret as that unjustifiably so she be definitely on the right track the slcc state throughout the sector there be grow concern about the impact bullying harassment and intimidation be have on councils councillors and staff and the result effectiveness of those local council the three national association be fully aware of the issue but without government intervention it be unlikely that they alone can solve this dreadful problem the preferred approach of the nalc be to focus on certain recommendation previously make by the committee on standards in public life which have yet to be adopt indeed the nalc assist in the drafting of early day motion table in november and support by hon and right hon member which specifically ask the government to re visit its response to the committee on standards in public life report on local government ethical standard and introduce the report recommendation in full include tough sanction such as suspension for poorly behave councillor in addition to that however the slcc and the alcc have indicate their endorsement of an alternative option formulate by mr derek biggs the hugely experienced and highly respected former town clerk of totton in my constituency to whom be indebted for his insight this way forward which fully support would be for the minister to agree to set up work party of expert in the area of town and parish council to examine the issue in depth and recommend practical solution to deal with it the work party brief would be to ensure the design and establishment of an appropriate independent enforcement body and to propose legislation provide for penalty sufficient to act as deterrent to transgressor that would be one way of finally deal with those who ignore the proper standard of behaviour that be rightly expect and approve by the government we really need to work together and end their sense of impunity in respect of unacceptable conduct in town and parish council be grateful to my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis for raise this important subject and also to the hon member for york central rachael maskell for her helpful intervention look forward to her bill have be urge to be brief as fellow welshman mr deputy speaker you will know that that can sometimes be quite tricky but understand from my hon friend the member for bolsover mark fletcher the whip on duty that he be keen to rush home to start make his cheese and pineapple hedgehog in preparation for his eurovision song contest party we all look forward of course to his extended invitation so want to be serious but also to be as brief as can in respect for the house the debate be timely because it come just week after election to many of our town and parish council up and down the land want to take the opportunity as have on previous occasion when have meet parish councillor to put on record our sincere thank for their service to their community they be always unpaid and usually unsung hero work to deliver change and improvement to the town and village in which they live and serve suppose should declare slight interest have start my political career as parish councillor before migrate to the district council supposedly move upwards to the county council and then fetch up here with the exception of membership of the other place have the full set of badge my right hon friend point be particularly important because the councillor elect last week be be welcome to their new authority and be induct for the first time in some instance into the rule and convention of public life we all know that vibrant local democracy flourish where the reputation of the local authority be hold in high regard it be an honour and privilege to serve as community representative and all those seek and achieve public office should be hold themselves to the high standard of conduct in recognition of the trust place in they the electorate have right to expect councillor to behave well and respectfully in all their interaction with each other with member of staff and with the public councillor decision making should be honest demonstrably transparent fair objective and in the good interest of all whom they serve there be no place in our system and structure of local government for bullying intimidation or harassment my right hon friend remark focus on bullying intimidation and other inappropriate behaviour on the part of councillor as he will know there have be incident where council clerk have effectively be charge with such offence so it can go both way it be important to nip it in the bud and cut it out as quickly as possible not just for the standard in public life set out by nolan and reiterate this afternoon but because it fundamentally sour the work environment of public service when people abuse their position bully cajole intimidate and so forth in council meeting as my right hon friend have note there be rule that apply be concerned that we still occasionally think of our town council and especially our parish council as some sort of quaint edwardian and vicar of dibley like institution where people quibble about whose turn it be to do the biscuit or whatever instead they be do incredibly important work as my right hon friend will know there be no cap that we in central government can place on the precept of town and parish council we merely rely on their good common sense we know that many town and parish council across the land have be ask to take up role and responsibility the management of public loo for example on behalf of their upper tier authority and they willingly do so those upper tier authority be they borough district or county council can be cap and when there have be pressure on local government finance and close collaboration between the constituent part of the local government family some burden have be pass on to low tier authority my right hon friend be right to point out that there be some standard lacunae put it no more firmly than that as he set out in some detail there be clear and growingly compelling case for have look at this issue again would be more than happy to continue the conversation that have have with nalc since be appoint last november would include the alcc and the slcc and be more than happy to include my right hon friend in those discussion to try to find common sense route to go through shall seize on that potential opportunity to ask whether we could all come and see the minister together there be lot of operator in this field and to have he and representative of the three organisation in the same room at the same time would be an extremely positive step begin my working day with an official visit to croydon council follow by visit to slough borough council both be hugely enjoyable and rewarding and the offer of be seize by my right hon friend during this adjournment debate be an invitation can not resist he make very important point and should have make that clear in my remark there be considerable and compelling merit to meet the three body together there be some overlap and some divergence of view and different organisation will have different way of see and identify solution to problem let we have roundtable if one want to call it that or meeting in the department to try to identify the issue and to try to deliver the simple easy and most straight forward solution we would do so not to be unduly heavy handed or to impose the dead hand of marsham street on our vibrant town and parish council but because we hold dear and view to be important and precious those value of civility transparency decency common sense and collegiality in all the fora in which elect or appoint people discharge public duty that be an expectation that the public rightly place on all of we and it be sometimes challenge but it be one to which we be all capable of rise look forward to further the discussion with my right hon friend close by again thank the hon member for york central for her contribution but particularly thank my right hon friend the member for new forest east who with his usual calm methodical logic put forward compelling case that only perverse minister of the crown could seek to resist question put and agree to house adjourn
