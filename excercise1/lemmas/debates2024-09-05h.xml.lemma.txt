keep my hon friend and any other local mp update as we have do to date welcome the secretary of state and his team to what think be one of the most important departments in government as sometimes lonely voice on the conservative benches advocate for industrial strategy signal support for his intention be sure that he agree that the big challenge be to convert our phenomenal science and technology leadership into sovereign industrial supply chain leadership around this country have lead the strategy for life science quantum engineering biology fusion may ask whether he agree that the key to this be cross departmental whitehall work and ensure that we do not end up with endless earnest well intend committee but actually engage the small business entrepreneur and investor who be drive these sector of tomorrow genuinely thank the hon member for those comment because be serious when say that believe that industrial strategy should command support across the political spectrum that be the norm in lot of comparable country to ours recognise not just the work that he do but the number of time he do it he be call back repeatedly by the last government to do that work be often strike by the comment that lord willetts make in the policy exchange pamphlet about the lack of supply chain for offshore wind really benefit scandinavian economy rather than our there be common area of interest and to make this industrial strategy more successful than the very credible approach take by the conservative government when theresa may be prime minister we need it to last long and for it to have consistency and permanence know that the advocate and designer of that policy want the chance to do that the strategy must also be cross departmental it will be lead by my department but it can not be solely my department that be engage can tell the hon member that all my cabinet colleague share our objective and keenness to make this work we do not just want strategy put on the shelf for the short or long term we want the strategy to make difference in the community that everyone in the chamber represent welcome that cross party support successful industrial strategy obviously have to include wise workforce strategy in the lake and dale of westmorland the workforce be far too small for our need and be sadly of hospitality and tourism business in the second busy visitor destination in the country be work below capacity because they do not have enough staff there be two main issue lack of affordable place for people to live and an inability to bring people in from overseas will the secretary of state support the extension of housing grant to build more social rent home in westmorland and youth mobility visa deal with the european union which would allow we to bring in people to supplement our far too small workforce the hon member make really important point we all have common area of concern about the united kingdom economy as whole the poor productivity since the financial crisis the level of growth not deliver the living standard and public service that we want and the low investment figure but there be also specific challenge in each part of the country the relationship between national policy local policy and local leadership be the way to address those issue the hon member be an extremely skilled parliamentarian and he add on couple of issue that be clearly beyond the remit of the department for business and trade he do it very well on the reset of the relationship with the european union there be practical pragmatic measure that will ask all member to support particularly on the recognition of professional qualification which think could have be part of the deal and what we be plan for food and agricultural product if we can be successful in that negotiation those be our ask there will be ask from the other side and we will have to work with our partner to negotiate these thing but recognise the hon member key point yes there be uk wide need but there be specific need in each area and we have to get they right for his area for mine and for everyone present far to the question about air products ask by the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn she and meet the company last night as be often the case business want to move fast than the government will the secretary of state give an assurance that he will do his very good to ensure that his department meet the deadline that air products hop for in wide context as the hon lady say northern lincolnshire be prime area for the renewable sector and the air products development be key to that the hon gentleman be right to say that business be often frustrate by the pace at which the government can go we be do considerable amount of work on how business interface with the government as whole how that be manage as relationship and how we can assemble the different part of the state in the way need to respond to some of our big investment opportunity frankly in the past we have often see the uk miss out particularly to for instance the french the choose france policy have be fairly successful from their point of view by take some investment that believe should have come to the uk they have get ahead of we we have to understand that the competitive environment that we be now in be extremely challenging and we have miss out on thing we have to change and get it right and well will work with the hon gentleman have already highlight the meeting schedule with my minister of state and he make fair point that we all recognise have to be address welcome the secretary of state to his place and wish he well in the position he now control in northern ireland we have many business that can excel but when it come to an industrial strategy particularly highlight the defence sector and the cyber security sector just last friday my right hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson and have chance to visit thales in east belfast staff there explain to we that they employ almost people on the site and they also have an apprenticeship plan that be in action and be take on another apprenticeship when it come to expertise they have the skill experience and success but they do not have the defence contract as they have in the rest of the united kingdom will the secretary of state say some word into the ear of the secretary of state for defence to ensure that northern ireland can play big part when it come to access those contract absolutely agree with the strength that the hon gentleman identify he will know that visit northern ireland as the shadow secretary of state partly to make that point we be responsible for the promotion of the defence trade so the relationship with the ministry of defence and the secretary of state for defence be very strong will absolutely do as the hon gentleman request call the shadow minister the government have repeatedly state that secure economic growth be their fundamental mission and that be of course an entirely laudable aim but the fact be that more red tape will have the opposite effect in the light of the right hon gentleman plan to introduce radical new labour law what would he say in response to the federation of small businesses which have make it clear that firm be increasingly worried about the government proposal fear that they will drive up the cost and risk of do business and thereby reduce their competitiveness and financial stability welcome the hon gentleman and the new shadow ministerial team to their post have sit on those benches in many question session and understand how it can be at time business of all size overwhelmingly support the labour party at the general election how we behave in government will be exactly

standard and prosperity that member on this side of the house be all about deliver more of high street businesses what step his department be take to help support high street business the decline of

of that the target be expect to be miss by car this year because of consumer resistance the effect on the car industry be that producer be restrict supply of petrol car to retailer and some be threaten to pull out of the uk market altogether in the light of consumer resistance will the secretary of state look again at the target set since consumer be clearly not go to be force to purchase car they do not want and producer will be force to try to get rid of car they can not sell be grateful to the right hon member for that question the policy to which he refer the zero emission vehicle mandate and its penalty as we ramp up to the phasing out of petrol and diesel vehicle be actually department for transport policy of the previous government we support it because there be no point in have an objective to phase out petrol and diesel vehicle without corresponding ramp up of regulation to do that there be an issue with consumer demand which affect all of europe we be work closely on that under the policy of the last government there be flexibility thing that can be transfer from one financial year to the next we keep everything under close review but we be commit to the

compensation act the detail of which be on the website one air be small and grow cargo airline base in my constituency which be have to deal with huge amount of additional red tape and cost as result of the brexit deal and the end of reciprocal arrangement with the eu can the secretary of state give an assurance that when minister negotiate mutual recognition of professional qualification the aviation sector will be include can give the hon lady that reassurance the aviation sector often complain about the lack of recognition particularly relate to pilot there be mutual interest in this area and it could be solid basis for negotiation we can never promise the outcome of negotiation but can promise she that it be priority for we welcome my right hon friend to his place before the election meet fruit grower in nazeing and more recently farmer in hatfield broad oak both in my constituency who raise concern about hire seasonal worker cause by britain exit from the eu what can his department do to address that issue recognise the point that my hon friend raise our reform to zero hour contract will not affect seasonal labour we recognise that it be an important part of the labour market additional burden have be place on business because of brexit as he outline we do not want to relitigate the argument of the past but we believe that we can make tangible improvement for business in his area and for everyone my right hon friend will be aware of the disgraceful union bust tactic and intimidation employ by amazon against gmb member seek union recognition at the amazon warehouse in coventry despite more than vote in favour union recognition be lose by just vote what step be he take to ensure that worker such as the brave and determine gmb activist at amazon can more easily win union recognition draw the house attention to my proud membership of the gmb trade union we believe that business work well when they give worker voice through recognise trade union would be very interested to hear more about what have happen at the amazon warehouse in coventry the government will look closely at that as part of our plan to make work pay we will simplify the process and law around statutory recognition last weekend hundred of thousand of oasis fan be leave anger by the notion of dynamic pricing concern that we be see across the wide economy do the minister agree that we need an urgent review of such price gouging system that certainly take the nation interest in more than one way the department for culture media and sport have already announce review into it and we will look at secondary pricing the whole system need urgent reconsideration and we understand that the competition and markets authority be look into the matter too what think have the secretary of state give to attend the williams inquiry the post office scandal be unfinished business it be now vital that we not only learn the lesson but accelerate redress for the innocent and crucially punish the guilty fast be very grateful to my right hon friend for that question as new secretary of state the inquiry and the whole issue have affect deeply how believe accountability and power should be consider in the role we have as ministers it come on the back of what we hear about grenfell yesterday and what we have hear about bloody sunday and hillsborough believe that although this be essentially legacy issue it be exactly the agenda that we have on come into these job the future of the post office must be link to the inquiry not just in term of redress but in how the business model work well for sub postmaster do not believe that this have be put into the public domain yet but have receive request to attend the inquiry will of course do so and believe it be an essential way to put across what we will take from that inquiry and our plan for long term reform in the future uk steel manufacturing urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade to make statement on the future of steel manufacturing in the uk the inheritance the government receive from the conservative party be nothing short of disgrace on steel over decade of lurch from crisis to crisis with no clear plan to safeguard the future of competitive domestic steel industry this government be determined to change that we have be work hard over the summer to set clear forward direction on steel and resolve number of complex issue that be only make bad by the indifference of the last government steel have be one of my department priority since our first day in office we be stand by our commitment to spend billion to rebuild the steel industry that be in addition to the million for tata steel the funding will harness public and private investment to secure job and boost growth we will take action to improve the wide business environment for the sector include reduce energy bill and enable more green uk make steel to be use in our infrastructure project the government be clear as the secretary of state for business and trade my right hon friend the member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds have make very clear that decarbonisation must not mean de industrialisation discussion regard the transformation of port talbot have continue at pace over recent week involve the company the workforce and the welsh government we be also in ongoing talk with british steel in similar vein more widely in our first day in office we host steel union leader to join we around the table and discuss our share commitment to achieve sustainable profitable uk steel industry the secretary of state and also meet regularly with key industry stakeholder we know that this be not easy but we be determined to create bright future for steel than the one we inherit thank mr speaker for grant the urgent question will ignore the minister political comment and focus on what be more important the future of thousand of worker in particular at the scunthorpe work part of which fall within my brigg and immingham constituency and where many hundred of my constituent work there have be widespread medium report suggest that coke will stop be import from october which would mean production would stop in scunthorpe by christmas there be rumour concern the fact that employee will be give notice very soon that be obviously create great anxiety among those directly employ by british steel and those in the supply chain which in northern lincolnshire extend to many thousand of people and many business accept that much of this be medium speculation but if you and your family be reliant on an income from british steel or business that support the sector it be very worrying time many people who have work in the steel industry all their life and people who know about the market for steel have genuine concern that turn off the blast furnace would see the end or at least the beginning of the end of steel manufacturing certainly in scunthorpe and possibly more widely if we allow scunthorpe furnace to close we will become more dependent on world market and effectively the good outcome that can be deliver from that be scunthorpe end up rolling steel produce in country across the world which would leave this nation vulnerable to price and supply volatility union have say that that would be devastating charlotte brumpton childs gmb national officer have be quote as say early closure of the blast furnace at scunthorpe would be devastating for the community and workforce and so it would union have be assure throughout the process that the blast furnace operation would continue throughout the construction of an electric arc furnace there have be no consultation over an early closure indeed when the minister visit scunthorpe early this year she say accord to the scunthorpe telegraph so it must be true that the uk need to maintain capacity to produce primary steel be that the government policy order be sorry but the hon gentleman have exceed the two minute allot to he do not know whether he want to give we one final sentence will bring my remark to conclusion if may madam deputy speaker by say that if the uk be to maintain domestic steel manufacturing capacity the government must accept that there will always be burden on the taxpayer thank the hon gentleman for his question let say couple of thing in response first the hon gentleman talk about be political it be not be political to say that the last government allow the steel industry to decline it be statement of fact it be also statement of fact to say that they leave billion black hole in our finance and statement of fact to say that the money they commit to port talbot come from the reserve that they have spend three time over be ashamed to tell the house that the million be not real money it be in the reserve that the last government have spend three time over in the first three month of the year in contrast there will be real money for our investment in steel draw from the national wealth fund secondly the hon gentleman be of course right in his analysis of the concern and unease that people be feel give the importance of these job and about the worry they must be experience as result of what they be read all can say to he be that we be talk regularly to the trade union as he would expect we to and to british steel and the local community be sure he will understand that can not comment on those commercially confidential conversation he also make point about virgin steel that we make regularly in opposition we be look into how we can secure primary steelmaking in this country through our billion investment in uk steel call the shadow minister thank you madam deputy speaker british steel be integral to growth and prosperity those be not my word but the word of the now prime minister less than year ago the drive for green steel must mean more job not few again those be not my word but those of the now secretary of state less than year ago during the election campaign he say we can not lose the ability to make primary steel but now we see quite clearly that labour plan for decarbonisation do in fact mean de industrialisation and that the drive for green steel will mean few job not more under the last labour government output fall by and similarly the promise that this government make just week ago to steelworker in scunthorpe port talbot and teesside and across the country have be break for week the government have allow rumour and speculation about the future of british steel to run rife while thousand of worker question whether they will have job by christmas contrary to what the minister have say when we be in government we work to deliver more sustainable long term future for the steel industry across the united kingdom include wales through our million commitment to build an electric arc furnace in port talbot now we risk be the only economy without the ability to produce virgin steel ask the minister the follow question have british steel indicate to the government that it will halt its import of coke coal later this year if so when do the government become aware of that be they committed to see electric arc furnace in scunthorpe what discussion have she have with the owner of british steel about the possibility that it will switch to foreign import from china to fulfil its supply chain obligation here in the united kingdom what meeting have she have with stakeholder include ben houchen and the welsh government regard the impact of future announcement on other steelwork across the united kingdom include on primary steel production community and supply chain across the united kingdom need certainty from this government it be hard to know where to begin in respond to that the previous government allow steel to run down the previous government do not believe in an industrial strategy the previous government do not believe in boost our supply chain the previous government do not understand the importance of the steel industry to our national security and the community we serve across the country this government do understand the importance of steel that be why we be commit billion from the national wealth fund on top of the million set aside for port talbot and we will develop strategy that enable the steel industry to grow the shadow minister know that can not comment on commercial and confidential conversation that we be have can reassure he however that we be talk regularly with british steel that we be talk regularly with tata that we be in deep negotiation with they that we be talk with the local community that we be involve with the trade union something that the previous government do not believe in but suddenly seem to think important and that we will get the good deal for worker and for the steel industry it be shame that we be not in government five year ago because we be where we be with some of these conversation the way the previous government approach industry be to wait for thing to get so dire that they have to spend million of pound of public money try to booster something whereas our approach be to build the industry up and put the right lever in place and we will see success that way president biden have just veto the foreign acquisition of us steel because he understand that it be vital to have sovereign capability in ensure the manufacture of virgin steel the reality be that at the end of the last parliament we be unable to establish clarity around that objective from the last government can the minister tell the house today whether it be the policy of this government to seek to ensure that this country carry on with its ability to make virgin steel thank my right hon friend for his important question we believe very firmly that successful steel industry be critical to vibrant and secure future crude steel production in the uk have decline by over since that be great shame and we will be try to reverse it virgin steel be incredibly important which be why we have the billion fund we be look at direct reduce iron production and other possibility for the uk we be work on it at pace and be happy to talk far about our thought call the liberal democrat spokesperson the steel industry have be leave in mess after year of mismanagement the abandonment of the industrial strategy by the previous government have be disaster right across our economy but nowhere more so than in strategic heavy industry such as steel which face many complex and interconnected challenge we can all agree on the vital importance of steel production whether that be in term of national security or of provide the material that we need for green economy it be equally clear that the steel industry need to be support to move towards green method of production and more sustainable footing while ensure that job be protect the sector desperately need the certainty of new industrial strategy can the minister give clear timeline for exactly when we will see that industrial strategy can she confirm that when the industrial strategy council be reboot it will be place on statutory footing through legislation so that it be properly empower to support our industry in the long term thank the hon lady for very sensible and thoughtful list of question we will be put the industrial strategy council on statutory footing which be important the point she make about decarbonisation and support for the industry be really important the previous government support the aim of deal with the climate crisis and the need for decarbonisation but they do not put in place any strategy to help anybody do anything on that front we need proper industrial strategy and alongside that proper industrial decarbonisation strategy how will our heavy industry decarbonise in way that do not de industrialise and do not mean that they shut up shop and go elsewhere how will we make sure that we enable all these industry to thrive the hon lady be right to say that it be not just about the steel industry we be look at much broad range of industry by sector and by geography to work out the good way to get this do in way that protect job and protect our industry steel be strategically important industry for this country as my hon friend have make very clear and welcome her commitment that decarbonisation must not mean de industrialisation we must avoid the mistake of the past one of the mistake make by the previous government be the delay in develop grid capacity and grid connection how be this government work with british steel and port talbot to make sure that the grid capacity and connection be in place to enable electric arc furnace production to be start as soon as possible my hon friend have hit the nail on the head as would expect he to we face many challenge but the grid be at the heart and soul of so many of they when we meet industry representative in opposition it be top of the list for everybody and my hon friend know that many company be say to we we ve be tell we can get grid connection until the late this issue be priority for we and we be tackle it and work at pace we have whole range of policy to speed up the grid connection to prioritise what we deal with first and to work with the company involve to make sure that we be go at pace steel be incredibly crucial particularly in scunthorpe and we have to get it right in order for most plant in the united kingdom to make virgin steel they need to be able to bring in coke coal the labour government policy be to ban bringing in coke coal which mean that thousand of job will be lose what be the minister go to do to reverse that decision so that job can be save thank the right hon gentleman for his question as say we be look at dri and other way of make virgin steel that mean we can be happy to have further conversation with the shadow minister rather than shout across the house at each other be happy to have conversation about how we can make sure that we both retain virgin steel production and adhere to our climate commitment the steel industry be cornerstone of the south wales economy as whole and the minister will know that there be concern right across the swansea bay community about these development and be visit the plant in port talbot tomorrow to hear more about they will the minister give we reassurance that the hard work she be do will continue to be hand in glove with the welsh government and local council they be work day in day out to make sure that there be future for the steel industry and all these community thank my hon friend and welcome he to his place can absolutely reassure he that we be work hand in glove with the welsh government and local leader have talk to the welsh secretary as have the secretary of state who be not able to stay for the whole of this uq because he have meeting about steel that be how important this issue be to we and we will make sure that we keep those work relationship welcome conversation with my hon friend and will meet any other local people whom he think we should be meet have some sympathy with the minister comment about the last government record of course under previous conservative governments ten of thousand of job be lose in aluminium oil refining and steel as result of the obsession with decarbonisation and net zero unfortunately do not think we will see different approach from this government the minister promise an industrial strategy but can she assure we that there will be provision for steel to have supply of coke coal produce in this country and that damaging and expensive decarbonisation requirement will not far detriment the steel industry thank the right hon gentleman for his question of course if we do not take measure to decarbonise and tackle the climate crisis the cost to this country will be infinitely high this be not choice interruption the hon member for orpington gareth bacon disagree but we need to make sure we can decarbonise in way that support our industry to make that transition which be exactly what we be do the point of an industrial strategy be to lay out plan so that the industry get the support it need so that investor understand the plan and so that by work together we can make sure we decarbonise the government be support that where we can and pull the lever we can we be support the industry to do the opposite of what happen under the previous government which be grow it be real pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker thank the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers for secure this important urgent question rotherham have proud history of steelmaking but have be fight against government for the last year for it to have proud future will the minister commit to address the underlie issue to make sure all government procurement go to british maker and to address the punitive business rate and high energy cost that be hamper our development thank my hon friend for make those important point our energy intensive industry be hammer by energy cost which be at the heart of this although the previous government provide relief we need long term solution we need to bring down those energy cost that be why we be push for clean energy by which will be cheap and why we want to produce more energy in this country so that we be not reliant on putin or affect by international event have talk about business rate and my hon friend be absolutely right that we need to look at that government procurement be very important so we be look at our supply chain and all the lever of government to see what we can do proactively to make sure that where we can we be make build and use in the uk do not think the minister answer the question ask by the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne so let repeat it do the government consider the manufacture of primary steel to be strategic domestic industry that must be protect yes or no well the previous government do not we have billion fund and as say we be look at dri to make virgin iron to be clear we be have to deal with mess that we inherit virgin steel be important and that be what we be look at be not go to say to the hon gentleman right now that this be what we be spend our billion investment on because this be be work on at pace we will come back to the house as soon as we have something to announce the defence industry manufacturing base be of course vital to this country not least in the engineering job it provide we know that steel be crucial to build armoured vehicle and ship for instance it be very important that we have regular and guarantee supply of steel and we want to see more uk steel use in defence manufacturing completely agree with my hon friend who have much expertise in this area the department be work closely with the ministry of defence and the secretary of state for defence to make sure we be maintain our defence we be build as much as we can in the uk with as many contract in the uk as we can we be use the power of government to deliver that the hypocrisy of this debate be utterly extraordinary everybody agree that steel be of strategic national importance yet the obsession with net zero of both main party lead by the conservatives be lead to the removal of our blast furnace by both british steel and tata that obsession be kill our steel industry and steel job and lead to our inability to produce primary steel over of all new steel generating capacity in the world be in asia and over of that be produce in blast furnace our obsession with net zero order be sure that the hon member be come to his question give the obsession with net zero will the minister guarantee that if tata be subsidise with more than million to produce new electric arc furnace the money will be link to the construction as oppose to tata take the money early and then not build the furnace the hon gentleman talk about our obsession with decarbonisation and produce green steel but we also have to go with the market the market and big company be now say to we we want to buy green steel that be what they be demand and what we will produce if we do not we will not be sell it on the same basis we will use the money we be invest through the national wealth fund to develop steel strategy that will enable we to bring new entrant into the uk which the previous government do not try to do so that we can have vibrant competitive steel economy in the uk and create good highly pay job in the green industry of the future if we fall behind other will come before we and take our job everyone agree that steel be crucial strategic foundational industry for this country but it suffer from very narrow margin it be one of the least profitable sector of all in this country we suffer from real cost disadvantage because of energy price other country such as france and germany have much low energy cost they have lot of nuclear which meet net zero requirement do the minister agree that underline the importance of why this country urgently need an energy strategy my hon friend be absolutely right we need to ensure we be produce cheap clean energy in this country as he rightly say that mean nuclear as well as solar wind offshore wind and everything else in our armoury this government have be unbelievably proactive with the secretary of state for energy security and net zero end the ban on onshore wind and agree to some of the solar panel installation we need we have an enormously successful contract for difference round that will allow float offshore wind and other type of energy and we be talk in detail about where we will take nuclear together all those thing mean that the country will have low energy cost that we can be more competitive and that our industry can thrive the minister be ask question by the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne which be repeat by my hon friend the member for west suffolk nick timothy about whether this government will commit to virgin steel making in the uk at the third time of ask will she commit to what the secretary of state commit to before the general election yes or no welcome the right hon member for croydon south chris philp to his place as have make clear we have be land with an inheritance in which steel have decline by and we be in very late stage negotiation in scunthorpe and port talbot we be deal with the consequence of that which the previous government fail to do we will be put billion investment into steel and we be work at pace look at dri which produce virgin steel and at other option we be look at how we can introduce competition and new entrant into the market we will work lot fast and hard than the previous government and we will ensure that the steel industry thrive the global steel industry be invest many billion of pound in new green technology that be more productive than current steel technology do my hon friend agree that our plan for steel will allow we to attract that private sector investment here in great contrast to the previous government policy that see our steel industry decline to size small than that of belgium my hon friend who be an expert in this area

from pensioner on less than half the minimum wage under the proposal of pensioner in poverty will lose the winter fuel payment be that labour members idea of government of service leave pensioner in poverty shivering at wintertime yesterday the prime minister refuse to explain why he be choose to fund huge pay rise for train driver and other state sector worker while slash benefit for impoverished pensioner that be not the kind of change that labour voter think they would get from labour government be it the prime minister also refuse to say yesterday how much less energy support an year old on just year would receive this winter compare with last perhaps he do not know the answer perhaps he do not care will the leader of the house confirm that the answer be that an year old on year will receive less energy support this year one pensioner write to say the allowance mean could turn the heating on now fear hypothermia during the come winter month no wonder the public oppose this policy by margin of two to one several labour members agree and have already sign motion condemn it and will presumably vote against it hope that all decent labour mp do the same but will the leader of the house confirm whether if they do they will lose the whip like their rebellious colleague last july at this rate it will not just be pensioner heating go by christmas it will be labour majority as well call on the leader of the house to arrange debate on ethic and integrity in the government the independent civil service commissioner former labour mp have have to initiate an inquiry into improper appointment by this government government of service it turn out they mean service to their crony and donor it be just wrong to stuff party donor and crony into what be suppose to be impartial civil service position can member imagine the howl of protest if the previous government have do that laughter to the civil service no the times report that the chancellor do not disclose to her permanent secretary the fact that she have appoint labour party donor to senior civil service position which would be breach of the ministerial code will the leader of the house tell we whether the times report be true we have even see labour party donor lord alli receive downing street pass for no apparent reason other than be donor of course who give he that pass be it the prime minister whose clothe lord alli apparently pay for that be extraordinary have anyone else here have donor pay for their clothe certainly have not or maybe sue gray issue the pass perhaps forget to declare that lord alli also contribute to her son election campaign will the government now come clean and disclose all the politically affiliate appointment that they have make to the civil service will they confirm whether the conflict be disclose as require by the ministerial code will they provide list of all pass to government building issue to anyone other than ministers civil servant and special adviser strongly suspect that this self proclaim government of service will not admit to any of those thing so later today will write to the adviser on ministerial interest and the civil service commissioner ask that they investigate independently these important question lot have happen this summer lot have go down as they say but the main thing that have go down be the government approval rating just last week more in common find that the prime minister approval rating have plummet by percentage point in matter of few week plumb new low of minus it turn out that parade around in worth of expensive suit pay for by lord alli subvert civil service independence by stuff the service with crony and donor and strip impoverished pensioner of their benefit be not that popular even the

over the summer on the previous government watch there be an asylum overspend of nearly billion shoplifting be effectively decriminalise crippling strike cost the country dear and unresolved pay award sit on ministers desk the right hon gentleman might want to give we lecture but only two year ago we see what happen when massive unfunded spending commitment be make against the advice of treasury

two year ago under liz truss whom the right hon gentleman back for leader nothing damage the real income of ordinary people include pensioner more than an economy crash crash cause by his government

country which break from year of year of leave britain expose to fossil fuel market which lead directly to the bad cost of living crisis and energy bill crisis in generation will the secretary of state give way not at the moment interruption the right hon gentleman need to calm down little bit know he get very angry we have have year of blind faith in free market and refusal to have an industrial policy which offshore clean energy job and year of government who be perfectly happy with state ownership of our energy system but with one crucial overriding condition that it would be state ownership by any country except britain that be the reality of what we inherit we already have widespread state ownership of britain energy asset by other country denmark sweden norway and france through their state own company indeed the city of munich own more of our offshore wind capacity than the british government follow the auction result announce on tuesday the large two offshore wind project to win contract will be build by ørsted danish state own company strongly welcome its investment but the question before the house today the question at the heart of this bill be simple do we think there should be british equivalent of state own energy generation company such as ørsted vattenfall statkraft and edf invest in our infrastructure we have simple proposition if it be right for the danes the french the norwegians and the swedes to own british energy asset it be right for the british people to do so as well that be why we fight the election on the crucial principle that the british people should have right to own and benefit from our natural resource to every member of the house who be consider their vote on this bill this afternoon urge they to vote for that principle to those think about vote against the bill ask they how they will defend to their constituent the idea that other country should own our national energy infrastructure but britain should not be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way he be normally fair man but what he do not mention be the risible state of renewable energy when we take power in it account for less than of electricity and we increase the figure to nearly we be country that have lead the world in this area it be the conservatives who transform our energy system to remove coal from the system be sure be just set up the secretary of state which be happy to do but what will state ownership do our system be arguably one of the most effective in the whole world at deliver green capacity and have be the most successful in cut emission what will state ownership do other than simply put the state and its complicated mechanism into programme that need to be speed up not slow down the right hon gentleman surprise he be brilliant set up man and he be welcome any time will now explain to he what state ownership will do here be why it be the right idea for our time it be the right idea for energy security because great british energy will invest in home grow clean energy that we control and speed up its delivery it be the right idea for job this be the learning from all those other country mention because great british energy will partner with the private sector to create job and make sure that we build the supply chain and job that the british people deserve it be the right idea for create wealth for britain this be what do not understand about the conservative party because state own company from other country be not invest in these asset as charitable endeavour they be do so to generate wealth for their country wealth that flow back to their taxpayer state ownership be the right idea for create wealth for britain because great british energy through its investment will help generate return for the taxpayer to answer the right hon gentleman directly it be right for energy security it be right for job and it be right for create wealth for our country will not support this bill tonight the secretary of state claim that it will put the british people in ownership of the renewable electricity supply market but that market be estimate be billion year he be propose to invest billion year can he not see the difference that billion will make to the overall investment the infrastructure will still not be own by the british people the right hon gentleman and have long history on these issue which make rather old indeed we use to spar about they year ago he be wrong about billion it be billion of investment over the parliament significant sum great british energy will not become edf overnight of course not but the point be that this government believe in create lasting long term legacy for britain which be what gb energy will do rise be go to make some more progress let go through what great british energy will do first it will invest in and own clean energy project particularly lead edge technology such as float offshore wind by work with the private sector and take stake in the project it support the truth be that we need to accelerate the deployment of wind solar tidal hydrogen carbon capture and nuclear and we need to face the reality that frontier technology carry risk that be why there be particular role for the government in help to de risk project by invest in they in partnership with the private sector and in do so capture value for britain gb energy will invest across range of clean energy technology use its billion capitalisation the chair have be appoint by the government but the company will be able to move at pace with operational independence be delighted that jürgen maier who have great record of achievement and be champion of uk manufacturing and good job have be appoint as start up chair completely agree with the basis of my right hon friend argument for end the offshoring of job energy asset and employment opportunity almost all solar panel be currently source from china power roll company in my constituency have develop lightweight flexible and cost effective solar module and be eager to establish its first gigafactory do he agree that to secure our energy future great british energy should be support and invest in innovative start up such as power roll in east durham my hon friend be brilliant champion of his constituency and these issue and he be absolutely right that part of the challenge we face be to expand our supply chain in britain be very interested in the example he give the secretary of state talk eloquently and powerfully about the physical investment come from this new measure will he elaborate on some of the benefit to our workforce particularly the training and development opportunity for young people through wide range of apprenticeship and the amazing multipli effect that will have for our economy my hon friend anticipate my point about how we build the supply chain and about the lesson we have learn from what state own company in other country have do to help catalyse supply chain of job and to work with the private sector will my right hon friend give way will give way one more time before make some more progress be very grateful to my right hon friend we hear the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart suggest few moment ago that thing be go wonderfully under the conservative government but do my right hon friend agree that the climate change committee warn few week ago that only third of the emission reduction that we need to achieve the target be currently back by credible plan be the reality not that we need step change thank god we have labour government to deliver it my hon friend be absolutely right and it be part of what this government have do in less than two month we have overturn the onshore wind ban consent large amount of solar power and on tuesday have the most successful renewable auction in british history will the right hon gentleman give way will not give way to the right hon gentleman again we have hear quite enough from he secondly know this be concern of the liberal democrats and of other member on both side of the house great british energy will deliver our local power plan work with local authority combined authority and community to deliver the big expansion of support for community own energy in history clean energy be not just about large scale infrastructure if we look around the world so many country have lot to teach we in denmark around half of wind capacity be citizen own and in germany almost half of solar capacity be citizen own our local power plan will learn from other country generate clean power and embrace it as way to generate return for local people to help tackle fuel poverty to unleash the dynamism and resource of local community and to win the consent of local people thousand of project across britain be tap into that energy and enthusiasm will my right hon friend give way will make bit more progress have the chance to visit the lawrence weston turbine in bristol which member may know about it be england tall onshore wind turbine and it be own by the local community power at least local home and reinveste revenue into local project rise have catch the eye of an infrequent contributor to this house so will give way thank the secretary of state for what he be put forward it seem logical for the uk to manufacture this process rather than other do it for we the question for my constituent say respectfully to the secretary of state be what will the price of energy be at the end lucidtalk poll for national energy action evaluate the impact of rise energy price on household in northern ireland it find that of household be spend more than of their income on their home energy cost how can we make sure that my constituent and indeed all our constituent can have energy they can pay for the hon member be absolutely right this be massive concern for all our constituent and great british energy be crucial tool to bring down price for our constituent the truth be that every member in this house have to make judgment on this do they believe that business as usual stay on fossil fuel will give we the energy security we need we discuss this in the house on tuesday the truth be that we have the bad cost of live crisis in generation because of our exposure to fossil fuel we be see price rise again on october not because of government decision but because of our dependence on international gas market the argument for clean energy year ago be climate argument it be now as much an energy security argument as climate argument rise be go to make bit more progress thirdly great british energy will work with industry to develop supply chain across the uk to boost energy independence and create good job the reality be that the last government spectacularly underdelivere on the promise of create job in clean energy it be true that british water be home to one of the large float offshore wind farm in the world kincardine just km off the coast of the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho nod but where be it make its foundation be make in spain and its turbine be instal in the netherlands and it be then simply tow into british water how can that be right this government be not neutral about where thing be make we want the future make in britain clean energy be the economic and industrial opportunity of the century and the truth be that other country be seize this opportunity britain be be leave behind the fact be extraordinary germany have almost twice as many renewable job per capita as britain sweden almost three time as many and denmark almost four time as many that be the previous government legacy what our friend and neighbour have realise be that domestic national champion be crucial tool to help deliver economic success the success of the danes for example can not be divorce from the role of ørsted in help to make it happen that be why great british energy will work alongside our national wealth fund and the british job bonus partner with industry to build supply chain in every corner of the uk deliver the next generation of good job with strong trade union and reindustrialise britain congratulate the secretary of state on his appointment may draw attention to the letter he write to fintan slye the chair of national grid eso in august and the response he have give in his open letter to the industry alongside question about the cancellation of the offshore co ordination support scheme which be come up with viable alternative for well delivery of the norwich to tilbury project mr slye say that the plan the eso will develop will be whole system spatial view of what be require to deliver clean secure operable electricity system by do that include all the work that eso have already do in its review of the norwich to tilbury project which include many viable option that could speed up the process and make it more viable for the long term look carefully at that issue before we make that decision have great respect for the hon gentleman but we can not justify spend public money on scheme that will not work and will not deliver for the british people which be why we do not go ahead with the second phase all the advice and all the evidence be that it just would not be value for money be glad that the hon gentleman draw attention to for the first time in this country since the last labour government be in power we be go to have proper plan we do not inherit proper plan and we need proper plan to give certainty to industry fourthly great british energy will support project development lead project through their early stage to speed up delivery while capture more value for the british people in particular through our partnership with the crown estate announce just two week into our period in government the partnership will co ordinate planning grid and lease for the seabed and importantly help speed up the roll out of offshore wind and other technology it have the potential to help leverage up to billion of private investment and deliver up to gw of offshore wind lease the truth be we have huge potential as country the chance for offshore wind to drive investment in coastal area from cornwall to grimsby opportunity for port from west wales to north of scotland to lead the world in the industry of the future and opportunity for supply chain company all over the world that be what this bill be about be terribly excited about the ambition of the labour government for gb energy in my constituency blyth port be thrive we have energy central on the blyth estuary catapult uk the offshore energy research centre and lynemouth power biomass power station may invite the secretary of state to see the issue in my constituency for himself and show business and resident how they can participate in the fantastic opportunity government be offer my hon friend be great champion for his area and he be right be sure he reflect the feeling of every right hon and hon member whatever side of the house they be on that there be huge opportunity in this sector we intend to exploit they look forward to see his constituency rise will make bit more progress have set out our case case that the british people overwhelmingly support accord to post election polling by more in common great british energy be support by an overwhelming of voter and oppose by just it appear from the conservative reason amendment so call that conservative members will vote against the bill today if they do that they will do something remarkable they will go one step far than refuse to listen to the people who do not vote for they by refuse to listen to the people who do vote for they quite remarkable feat by an opposition because great british energy be support not just by labour voter but by conservative voter by majority of four to to rise will make bit more progress interruption conservative member be still in the the show be great but the audience be poor stage of opposition let give they some advice they will get out of that over time but they be in the early stage now because get my kick in strange way for bit of light entertainment have be read what the conservative party leadership candidate have be say it be really interesting honestly it be quite fun reading interruption yes somebody have get to do it the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat say that people will never vote for party that they have stop take seriously well that be true he say they should be give credit for see the error that we may make and correct they correct the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch believe the shadow minister the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho be the mastermind for her campaign say it be no good have the same policy argument from the last parliament the shadow minister should take those word to heart agree with those candidate that the conservative party need to move on be in generous mood madam deputy speaker have be involve in leadership campaign so have some advice have free idea for the not very famous five still leave in the tory leadership competition back an idea that the public support back an idea that conservative voter support back an idea that labour voter support back an idea that reform voter support reform member be not here back an idea that liberal democrat voter support they should move on from the argument of the last parliament show bit of bravery even break the whip and stand out from the crowd they should break from the past and back our bill today the secretary of state know share his passion and ambition to get to net zero one big concern about gb energy be that it will crowd out rather than crowd in investment will he enlarge on how he intend to crowd in investment into green energy be very surprised by the liberal democrats say that it be slightly orange book liberal democrats if may put it that way for those old enough to remember say respectfully to the hon lady and all member of the house look around the world at what be happen before our eye there be catalytic public investment public investment lever in private investment the whole old fashioned free market argument about crowd out turn out to be wrong just look at what be happen in america why be the money flow to the united states in part because of the catalytic public investment interruption can see opposition members be go to be slow learner great british energy be at the heart of our long term plan to accelerate the transition to clean energy and ensure we be never at the mercy of volatile fossil fuel market again it will speed up delivery create good job and protect family finance and we will reap the benefit for generation to come commend the bill to the house before call the shadow minister to the dispatch box remind hon member that question to the minister be take through the chair so they must make eye contact with the chair and not the minister beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and insert this house while recognise the need to cut household energy bill for family accelerate private investment in energy infrastructure and protect and create job in the energy industry across the uk decline to give second reading to the great british energy bill because great british energy will not produce any energy will not reduce household energy bill by do not compensate for the amount of investment in energy project that will be deter by the government plan to prematurely shut down the uk oil and gas sector and involve an unjustified use of taxpayer money at time when the government be withdraw the winter fuel payment from million pensioner as energy bill rise welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to be back know the secretary of state will have have busy summer settle into government have the eagle eyed civil service now screen all his comment and hungry press pack on his tail about every promise he have make he even slot in trip to brazil place very dear to my heart but perhaps he should have spend bit more time on the bill if the bill do everything he and his team have promise will be impressed let remind the house what be on the record if it save off bill by if every project it invest in be guarantee to turn profit by if it can get new innovative energy prototype off the ground and create job even will be impress but here be the rub the bill be four page long there be barely anything in it do not want to oppose the bill just for opposition sake but the secretary of state have provide no detail on how the bill will deliver any of his promise let alone all of they it be four page bill in which he be ask for billion of taxpayer money while set out no investment plan no figure for the energy that will be produce no number for energy bill saving or carbon emission reduction and not even timeline doubt it can deliver any of the thing he have promise he be ask for billion of taxpayer money completely blank cheque for an energy company that will not cut bill or turn profit by will come back to those promise rise will give way in second the secretary of state be set up new body when our energy sector be not short of state run body we have ofgem the national energy system operator the climate change committee great british nuclear and of course the uk infrastructure bank with billion to provide debt equity and guarantee for infrastructure finance to tackle climate change set up by the former prime minister at this point the taxpayer might well ask why they be cough up twice for programme that do the same thing here be why when read the bill tiny as it be it ring bell and lo and behold it be carbon copy of the infrastructure bank legislation so why do the same thing again well there be few important omission and tweak first while the infrastructure bank legislation set out direction for governance by director and non executive director the bill do no such thing while the infrastructure bank legislation appoint an independent person to carry out review of the effectiveness of the bank in deliver its objective the bill do no such thing lastly while the infrastructure bank legislation give special power to direct investment to the treasury to independent civil servant the bill give power to the secretary of state who as far as be aware have no investment background and no financial training and whose only period in the private sector if have this right be as researcher at channel my right hon friend be absolutely right the bill set out huge power for the secretary of state he will be like the slim controller of the energy system as he try to interfere but he have track record in such cluelessness the decarbonisation target we need more ambition he say we have therefore hop that the self confess nerd would know how to do it but we have the letter in august to fintan slye of the electricity system operator which set out the fact that the secretary of state do not have clue about how to deliver decarbonisation the answer from fintan slye if he be not in such an impossible position would have be short it can be do you need to do your homework thank my right hon friend for his intervention it be always pleasure to see he in the chamber make excellent point the question that have be this why have the secretary of state set up duplicate programme with no instruction for governance independent review investment plan or consumer saving that he can be judge by why should taxpayer money fund similar entity when the only difference that can discern be that it give the secretary of state unchecked power what be it about the billion of taxpayer money that he can direct without check or balance that first attract he to the idea of gb energy these be fair and reasonable question for we as the opposition to ask and he must look to improve the governance in this bill let turn to the promise that he make the prime minister the chancellor the secretary of state and at least labour mp promise their constituent in the july election that gb energy would save they year on their energy bill they say it on their election literature on social medium and in husting they say it because they be tell to do so by the secretary of state but listen very closely to his speech today and do not hear he make promise that gb energy will save they on their energy bill in debate just before the summer recess the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks would not repeat the promise either that be because they all know that it be not true in fact one of labour first act in government have be to take away up to from million pensioner this winter include two third of pensioner in poverty it take some nerve for the labour party to say that it never want to do this because the winter fuel payment be in the manifesto of the secretary of state party when he write it in it be in there when he be leader in it be in there in and in but in it be omit there be no mention at all for the first time in year will give credit to the right hon gentleman something that do not always do when he be leader in he put it in his manifesto that he would take the payment away from the top of pensioner he will remember that he have the courtesy of tell the public his plan but professional politician that he be suggest that he would have clock that it be not include this time round he have be in politic for year and would have know what that mean so hope that he can confirm today whether he have any conversation with the prime minister the chancellor or morgan mcsweeney before the manifesto come out if so he send out those labour candidate all the people on the benches behind he with this false promise of the energy saving when someone clearly know that they be go to take that amount away from million of pensioner this winter my right hon friend refer to the letter that be send by the secretary of state to fintan slye the head of national grid eso and curiously there be nothing in the secretary of state letter that refer to the need to lower electricity price the term electricity price do not appear in the letter and neither do the term security of supply do she agree that those be the two great concern about rush the decarbonisation target absolutely agree with my hon friend and will come on to that point there will be vote next week on the winter fuel payment think the government have confirm that everybody hear the secretary of state speak today so say to those on the opposition benches that if they want to break the whip if they want to stand out from the crowd be sure that they will have his encouragement let we come back to those saving the secretary of state have promise bill saving by through gb energy believe that be correct the question be how do he have any serious energy expert who think that that be possible with an investment of billion over five year that be drop in the ocean when it come to energy investment it be fraction of the amount of investment that he be deter from the private sector into clean energy with his plan to shut down the north sea he talk about offshore wind nuclear and hydrogen in his found statement but none of those thing get build in five year let we be honest the likelihood of his plan bring any power online by be tiny the idea that it will be enough to lower bill across household be frankly for the bird when we ask his department how much energy he want to enable through the bill his department say that it would be look at in due course that be just not good enough the second promise be clean power by gb energy be suppose to be the silver bullet to reach the secretary of state target of decarbonise grid by we will come on to whether that be good idea bit later to do that he say that he need billion year his chief secretary to the treasury talk about hundred of billion of pound and he have in fact secure from his chancellor billion year he talk about national ownership this be not enough money to do that and he know it he himself think that his plan would cost vastly more yet he be promise to do it all now with of the fund that be just not credible then we come to promise no the government say that in every single project that gb energy invest in there will be return for the british report july vol that be what the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for rutherglen say on july it be in hansard if member want to check it say in every single project what labour be tell industry be very different it say that it will use that billion of taxpayer money to de risk its project believe that the secretary of state say that in his speech today what do that mean that mean that it will be invest in the part of those project that the energy company do not expect to be profitable may ask this what be it about the secretary of state vast private sector experience which he gain as researcher at channel that make he think he can turn profit when experience multimillion pound energy company can not he have not set out an expected financial rate of return any risk profile or timeframe for these return those be the minimum thing that anyone seek investment should set out and say that as someone who be financially train know that the right hon gentleman be not but this be basic stuff here be the problem if the secretary of state goal be to give taxpayer good deal he should be invest on commercial rate which would just displace private sector capital and would not speed up his decarbonisation target produce more energy or low bill but if his goal be to de risk more speculative project that be the line that he be give industry and the thing that he say today then by definition he will be throw taxpayer money into the least attractive part of investment by which mean the part that multimillion pound company do not want the risk be that gb energy far from generate any profit for taxpayer will become skip for all and everyone to put their problem and their failure inside this be crucial because we can not let the government repeat at national scale what labour council have do at local level interruption labour members groan but they should think about what local taxpayer have have to face robin hood energy in nottingham which collapse leave resident with debt of million bristol energy which fail cost resident million warrington stake in together energy leave resident with potential liability of million these be small time project with budget in the ten of million on point of order madam deputy speaker can not hear what the shadow secretary of state be say because there be so much noise come from those on the government front bench they do not want to hear what she be say because it might be true thank the hon member for that comment he will know that that be not point of order would the shadow secretary of state please proceed this be really important because we be talk about taxpayer money those be small time project with budget in the ten of million but the secretary of state be ask for budget of billion of pound with no plan he mention couple of company in his speech include edf which make loss of billion in and ørsted which make loss of billion in so think it be right that we ask some of these question the right hon lady mention robin hood energy and other local energy company that be in fact supply company we be talk about great british energy company that will be generate energy she simply do not understand that she be make mistake about our plan and fail to understand what be actually go on she be suggest that something be go to happen that be not go to happen if the hon lady would bravely like to say that the company will generate energy be sure that she would like to tell we how much because no one else seem able to will the right hon member give way be sorry but will make some progress finally this be really important the secretary of state pay lip service to nuclear but we know that when labour be last in power it do not start single nuclear power plant in all its year all summer there have be an eerie silence on the capital raise for sizewell which should be out by now nothing on the small modular reactor competition which should be decide its final project now nothing we commit to third large scale nuclear power plant at wylfa again nothing we write to the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for rutherglen but once again he have refuse to confirm any detail or with regard to wylfa whether those plan be even in place can the secretary of state say whether the creation of gb energy be slow down those project and cause the timetable of these programme which will provide clean cheap energy to slip will the right hon member give way will not will continue once again we simply have no answer find all this very strange because at our last encounter in this house the secretary of state be keen to confess that he be super nerd as someone who have be lifelong mathlete be the first person to want to champion fellow super nerd but when meet super nerd they normally like evidence fact and number whenever we look at what the secretary of state have set out there be no number attach he talk about decarbonise the grid by but he have not set out the full system cost of that he promise profit and bill saving from gb energy but he can not tell we by when or how much when it come to the bill and its target it be clear that the secretary of state do not have the number because two week ago he write letter to the director of the electricity system operator have it here do you know what he say madam deputy speaker he ask the director to please provide practical advice on achieve clean power by include high level assessment of cost give that we be talk about people energy bill think the public would like detailed look at what this be go to cost they to top it off he ask the director to advise what action his government should take to enable delivery clearly set out where further work be require the evidence could not be clear he go into general election with pledge and no idea how to achieve it what it will cost or whether it be achievable at all that be the exact point that want to make be very keen for the secretary of state to take my intervention on that point the key practical tangible thing that my constituent want to know be when they will see the saving that he promise they during the general election that be what really impact family and household up and down this country when minister come to sum up the debate will they restate that commitment to household about saving that be very fair question hope that the energy minister who assume will wrap up the debate will be able to provide some detail far from be super nerd the truth be that the secretary of state be the ultimate career politician he come up with big title and make big promise to the public but he have no idea how to deliver my big he should listen because it be an important point my big fear be that he be lose focus on all the amazing technology that will come online after whether it be fusion energy the next generation of nuclear reactor or carbon capture these be the innovative new technology that will not just deal with the of emission in the uk but the produce overseas in government focus lot of my time on speed up the development of those technology we launch the billion green industry growth accelerator specifically to reduce any supply chain constraint for example on cable we provide almost million to help the uk become the first commercial producer of advanced nuclear fuel outside russia we be make britain one of the most exciting place in the world for fusion energy development with million of funding thank the right hon member for give way finally she be criticise the government for the rushed target of decarbonise the grid by can she enlighten the house on when the conservative party would do it will this be critical point which have make in recent week the point about have long to decarbonise be that it give time to develop british supply chain that be exactly what be do the green industry growth accelerator and some of the other thing that have talk about give we time to set up british company those thing can not be do in five year there be need to get project finance to hire worker and train they and to get planning permission there be huge amount that need to be do the fact that the secretary of state want to rush the transition and make it happen at breakneck speed be risk british job and livelihood and make we dependent on chinese supply chain the secretary of state have promise many thing with the bill but he simply can not set out any detail about the thing that he want to deliver it would be blank cheque for billion of taxpayer money with no plan no evidence and no number for the bill saving or profit that he have be promise the british public that be why we can not support the bill as it stand call becky gittins to make her maiden speech much like one of clwyd east famous son john prescott who hail from prestatyn do hope my maiden speech pack punch give that the custom in maiden speech be for the new member to talk about some of the good

eight minute whether it be support local business to thrive improve public transport keep our community safe improve people right at work or help young people to fulfil their potential will do all can for the people of clwyd east and will work tirelessly to repay the trust that they have place in call the lib dem spokesperson congratulate the new hon member for clwyd east becky gittins on wonderful whistle stop tour of her constituency from wonderful dog walk to rowdy cow in field and fascinating museum that testify to the history of her constituency we live in liverpool for year many year ago and we visit her constituency many time and have wonderful day there know how beautiful it be champion renewable energy be in our dna as liberal democrats renewable be clean cheap and popular we welcome the fact that the new government be turn around the damaging attitude take by the conservative government and be attempt to make the uk once more global leader in get to net zero we be absolutely on the side of the government when it come to the ambitious target that be be set to get to net zero we be pleased that through the bill new step be be take to restore british investment in the green economy the bill must ensure that renewable energy and home insulation can be roll out at speed so that we meet our climate target bring down energy bill and provide green well pay job in the future the previous conservative government obsession with oil and gas leave we in mess the dithering delay and even deny of the tory government hold we back have often say that net zero be not like bus that we can miss and say whoop we get the next one this be target that we can not miss and delaying be just as bad as deny that climate change be happen at all will the hon lady give way be happy to give way the right hon gentleman and have have many discussion on this issue wonder whether the hon lady know of single major economy on the planet that go fast than the previous conservative government in cut emission be happy to respond to that because do believe that the uk be global leader there be cross party agreement about net zero but the last government break that agreement that be our problem each year and each month matter when it come to set the pace to get to net zero instead of produce our own renewable energy we be leave reliant on fossil fuel the energy of the past and on dictator such as vladimir putin in this unstable geopolitical environment that be death sentence and lead to the catastrophe of the recent energy crisis family be once again worried about another dramatic energy bill increase we say that honestly to this government and want to work with they on this issue this time of on typical family annual energy bill pensioner be also rightly concerned about the government plan to cut the winter fuel allowance for million of the poor and most vulnerable people raise the matter in business question early and say what be important to we we of course recognise that through the pension increase next april there will be relief for pensioner but this winter when thing have become really difficult for pensioner the government should not make cut before we have see the benefit we have be make that point and hope to work constructively it be political choice and in our view it be the wrong one but it be pretty rich of the conservative party to complain it be clear that if we be to hit our net zero target we must drive up investment in renewable energy the climate change committee progress report find that policy reversal and delay together with inconsistent messaging hinder progress just when acceleration be need only around one third of the emission reduction require to meet the target be cover by our current plan challenge the shadow secretary of state on what the conservatives plan for decarbonise actually be but we have have no answer we must for example at least triple the operational capacity of offshore wind installation to meet our target and we liberal democrats absolutely believe in the target new first in class renewable energy technology be come on the scene thick and fast and the government must find well mechanism for fund they than we currently have in place one example if may bring it up be drift energy which be base in my bath constituency hope the secretary of state be listen drift use sail ship to travel to the deep sea to harvest deep ocean wind and generate green hydrogen interesting technology be come on board but these new technology still face many investment problem the green hydrogen be then deliver to port around the world they be essentially fish ship for energy truly novel technology like this do not fit neatly under department so it become exceptionally hard to win grant let alone multimillion pound grant support it be important that we be aware of that do my hon friend agree that we need the bill to look at and include scheme like the cheltenham green deal run by cheltenham borough council through which local organisation that could not otherwise fund green scheme be able to access funding borrow by the local council such scheme will then make money and provide return for the taxpayer so that local area can start produce more renewable energy for themselves for example through the investment in solar panel on the roof of cheltenham town football club as progress with my speech my hon friend will hear that our focus on local authority local decision making and local involvement be crucial let we ensure that our emerge technology which have the potential to be hugely valuable be not overlook or force to seek support from abroad do my hon friend agree that the secretary of state should take on board one of the emerge technology that could deliver the most for great british energy the potential for tidal range energy in previous life be responsible for the consenting of the swansea tidal lagoon which unfortunately the previous government fail to fund it be the second big tidal range in the world and could be massive success story for great british energy and the uk do she agree that the secretary of state should take that on board as key objective of great british energy totally agree and be sure that the government will agree too lot of these decision be ultimately about value for money as these tidal range technology come on board they can become cheap hear the government be say that this be exactly the plan that where it be currently expensive great british energy can come in and provide support we understand and support that principle this new government must ensure that they have clear and consistent message delay to the phase out date of fossil fuel vehicle and boiler as we see under the last government have send mixed signal to investor business and consumer we hope that gb energy will go some way in provide confidence to other investment body and the wide industry that britain green economy be open for business we liberal democrats realise the importance of community buy in the new government must put local voice at the centre of the journey to deliver net zero we need to win heart and mind to persuade people that net zero project be good for their community for their pocket and for our future national economy the government have say that they believe community that host renewable energy infrastructure should benefit from it but there be currently no way to force developer of on ground mount solar panel farm to provide community benefit do my hon friend agree that the government should use this bill to make provision for guarantee community benefit in these circumstance we have already have some detailed discussion about what we be do with community that have to host vital infrastructure and it be important that the government assure local community and the liberal democrats that this will happen as the bill progress we need to discuss how we can get legal assurance and whether the bill be the right place for this as have say we need to win heart and mind to persuade people only with local consent can we successfully deliver the path to net zero which be why we have call for community live near large scale infrastructure project to receive community benefit for example through reduce energy cost and fund local initiative we be keen to work collaboratively to ensure that these benefit be in place in legislation we liberal democrats welcome the inclusion of clause which list specifically all the object of gb energy although those aim all have their merit the government have fail to include anything on community energy that be especially may continue will lay this out as understand it work on the all party parliamentary group for community energy and will get to my point it be especially disappointing that the new government have fail to include anything on community energy give their welcome word in the house about how important it be to enable community energy hear it again and again it be no long about word we now have bill before we in which we can make this happen will lay out what think be necessary without the inclusion of community energy the bill will be major miss opportunity in the past the now secretary of state and his ministers have be vocal champion of community energy in previous debate on make britain clean energy superpower the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks state one of the mission of gb energy will be around the idea of community own power he have also advocate for local community to have some sense of ownership of the report july vol that they generate last year the secretary of state himself table two enable amendment on community energy to the then energy bill his new clause specifically would have require large scale energy supplier to offer special agreement to small scale energy company he have speak at length about labour local power plan much of which we be in agreement with but where be the commitment to community energy in this bill the big issue we identify be that energy supply licensing condition hinder small community energy project from sell directly to consumer in turn this make it difficult to retain advantage for local community discount on their energy bill for example or raise new money to invest in new project the high burden and cost currently involve in be licensed energy supplier mean that not single community energy project in all the uk can sell its power directly to local people locally sourced energy do not travel far across the nationwide grid and therefore reduce that constraint on it but the cost benefit of sell locally produce energy to local consumer be not go to community project and nor do they benefit the consumer that must change regulatory change be require the government must put they in place or stop talk about their support for community energy community energy scheme need to receive guarantee discount price for the clean electricity that they contribute to the energy system if the cost of sell their power to local household and business be proportionate many more community energy scheme would become financially viable and we would get many more than we have urge the government to really look at our concern and what we can include in the bill to make these regulatory change clause be the ideal place to add community energy and ensure that it be one of great british energy object to conclude we liberal democrats welcome the step be take to restore british investment in renewable energy after the mess leave by the previous government these step will help we to bring down energy bill create high quality job increase our energy security and of course reach net zero however there be clear gap in this bill for community energy despite labour manifesto commit to it and we urge the government to listen to our concern rise call mike reader to make his maiden speech have have the opportunity to hear some amazing maiden speech in this house follow such fantastic speech must admit that feel bit nervous standing here but be also deeply honour to be in the house thank my hon friend the member for clwyd east becky gittins for her fantastic maiden speech and for graciously meet my family when they visit last year they be her constituent it be clear to that the talent enthusiasm and fresh thinking that the new cohort of mp be bring into this house will help to restore our country fortune and deliver the change that the country vote for be delighted to make my first speech in the debate on gb energy for many year it have not sit right with that our neighbour and trading partner around the world have benefit from the investment of uk plc in clean energy whether it be wind farm build in scandinavia or investment in nuclear by our french government partner the uk public have be sell short on clean energy investment it be right that the

and area such as weston favell billing and rectory farm in the eastern district each area of my beautiful constituency have its own individual identity in the centre of my constituency remain the legacy of the shoe and boot trade that be once the main employer in my town the church shoe factory remain in st james and the surround terrace in far cotton and delapre be still stand strong nearly year after they be build as my hon friend the member for northampton north lucy rigby note yesterday church hold the honour of be the choose cordwainer of renowned former member for sedgefield great institution such as our university our general hospital our football club and our premiership win rugby club sit in northampton south interruption be expect shoe army then but that fine my

production logistic and fulfilment manufacturing healthcare and research and development look forward to work with the bid team to ensure that it continue to be major employment hub in northampton south for year to come anyone who have visit my constituency or grow up there will know that we be the home of the national lift tower which stand at over foot high tall than the statue of liberty the formation of the newly shape northampton south constituency mean that have have the opportunity to take over from two former member of parliament who have have very different experience and career in this house and would like to pay tribute to they both andrew lewer the previous mp for the former northampton south constituency be focus on parliamentary business and tackle the challenge that he see as the most important to the uk he champion the motor neurone disease association which be headquarter in northampton as well as independent school and house building locally he will continue to be recognise through the annual spencer percival debate that he help to set up in the town he be also the only person to have hold the position of leader of council member of the european parliament and member of this house testament to his public service also take over in part from dame andrea leadsom the former member of parliament for south northamptonshire many of the southern village that have now join northampton south be in her constituency dame andrea serve as secretary of state under the previous government and have formidable record of championing parent and child include by establish the northamptonshire parent infant partnership in my county many of the people who have write to since my election have praise her advocacy for they as their constituency mp it be clear that she make massive difference not only in this house but in our county northampton may hold the accolade of be the large town in the uk will take that up with hon member for read after the debate but our town have have continual lack of investment and lack of vision and drive to make it well unfortunately we have have no shortage of conservative scandal public loan to our football club go missing our county council be make bankrupt the former police fire and crime commissioner stand down over misogyny complaint and allege domestic abuse mean that the leader of the council resign and now stand as an independent trust in politician in northampton be at an all time low but there be hope for northampton and it come with labour government this labour government will make northampton place to be proud of we will tackle our chronic air quality challenge fix our road improve our bus network ensure that housing be affordable of good quality and highly sustainable make work pay and route out of poverty grow the co operative social enterprise and mutual sector in our town bring nhs dentist back to northampton end the am scramble for gp appointment face head on the funding gap leave in our public service and address the special educational need and disability crisis that be rock our county it be clear that there be lot of work to do but as say in my acceptance speech at the count the hard work start here and really mean it can not wait to get start let be the first to congratulate the hon member for northampton south mike reader on his maiden speech he have demonstrate in two way that he be quite rare beast be an engineer be not widely hold profession in this house and he will no doubt bring great value with that expertise and experience but his business experience be also extremely valuable be afraid that if he look around he on the labour benches he will see precious few people with any business experience as the secretary of state have show with his bill the bill be about set up shell company that be it the idea that that constitute an energy policy be complete myth in fact the government have not even produce an energy policy there have not be white paper on uk energy policy under this government there be no page full of datum and number to give we any confidence that the government know what they be try to achieve how they will achieve it or what the risk be in fact that be give away in an astonishing letter that the secretary of state write to the director of the electricity system operator ask for all the information that one would expect the government to have give that this be major platform in their manifesto interruption the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks shake his head will give way to he if he want to intervene but where be the number where be the datum back up this wild assertion that just go all out for renewable will provide security of supply and low energy cost it be mantra that labour member keep repeat to themselves with increase enthusiasm and vehemence to make up for the fact that they have no number to back up their assertion let be clear about one thing be an advocate of achieve net zero believe in the target of net zero by indeed be member of the net zero all party parliamentary group when member hear speak they be not listen to some luddite or climate change denier want this policy to work but there be very considerable risk which be evidence by read between the line for what be not in the secretary of state letter and what be clearly flag in fintan slye response to it do the hon member not recognise that under the previous government the uk be fall badly behind on investment when other country particularly the us have transform the investment that they be draw in by make very big government commitment to some project particularly nascent one do he not recognise that that sort of government support make big difference to business confidence do not agree with that simply because we have see massive investment in renewable over the past year as the former minister my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart and the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend the member for east surrey claire coutinho set out we have be make fantastic progress with bring renewable on stream but there be considerable question to ask wish it be as simple as set up shell company and say we be go to get the state to do everything but be afraid it be not as the shadow secretary of state point out ørsted and edf make massive loss and either the taxpayer have to pay for those loss or those cost go on to electricity bill the secretary of state announce on tuesday that we have get all this renewable capacity come on stream enough to power million home that be if we match the maximum capacity of the renewable with the average annual demand of those home but of course renewable be intermittent it seem such an obvious thing to say but we have to say it sometimes the sun be shin sometimes the wind be blow and sometimes we have enough water for hydroelectric power but sometimes not in the winter month solar make very little contribution it make no contribution in the dark at night interruption it may seem obvious and the hon member for stroud dr opher may laugh but we need to point these thing out because when the secretary of state say that renewable be cheap than fossil fuel he be compare the strike price with the cost of buy marginal supply capacity when we need that extra marginal supply the strike price will not be reflect in our electricity bill because we have to add in other thing such as system balance cost we have to add in grid infrastructure cost because renewable require massive investment in grid infrastructure we have to add in the cost of import through interconnector when we do not have enough domestic supply we have not begin to factor in storage cost the storage capacity of our electricity system be still miniscule member should read the royal society paper on create electricity storage in this country it be go to be astronomically expensive and will probably still not be enough then there be constraint payment oh yes the constraint payment this year we be pay million to renewable producer under the contract for difference scheme not to produce electricity when they can produce it because that be how the system work that be how we have attract so much investment but those payment be go to be about billion next year would like the government to produce some forecast how much will the balance cost be in each year over the next or year how much grid infrastructure investment will need to be fund that appear on our electricity bill it be the stand charge and boy that charge be go to go up with all the infrastructure investment that we will require how much will we have to spend on import electricity the two interconnector come into east anglia as part of the norwich to tilbury programme will be import electricity they be not for export because the only security of supply we will have if we have shut down all our combine cycle gas power station by be from other place indicate dissent the minister shake his head but if we have shut down all that capacity if we can not generate the electricity ourselves we will have to get it from other place there be phenomenon call wind drought which can go on for very long period what be we go to do when the wind turbine be not turn and the sun be not shin during very cold spell in the middle of winter we have one or two close scare this winter the generate margin that we use to enjoy have go the great risk of accelerate the decarbonisation of the electricity system be that there will be more appeal for voluntary or compulsory restraint from industry because industry be the hide customer that be shut off when we be short of electricity or we risk more brownout or even blackout that be not impossible so where be the datum upon which the minister be place so much confidence that show these forecast to be wrong be not make they off my own bat there be plenty of people out there make they that bring to the final brief point want to make understand the logic that the minister explain in his letter to be sure that member with the experience of the hon gentleman will know that britain return to be net exporter of electricity last year so assume that there will be additional cost from import electricity due to the transition to renewable simply do not stack up do he also recognise that when the sun do not shine and the wind do not blow the tide still rise and fall twice day day year future rest on renewable energy be possible and we need to have that ambition for the united kingdom absolutely share that ambition but the question be how quickly we can get there at the moment tidal power produce almost nothing as proportion of our electricity requirement it be also intermittent by the way four time day there be period during which it do not generate anything and we need to replace that supply with other thing the real challenge be how we get to the objective that the hon gentleman and share in rational way that carry the british public with we it be noticeable that what people be complain about most be the price on their electricity bill today the constraint cost balance cost infrastructure cost and import cost that mention make up perhaps of domestic electricity bill if that figure be wrong let the minister produce some figure of his own that explain what proportion of consumer bill arise from all those factor because it be not explain there be no transparency on our electricity bill on the hon gentleman point about the objective of decarbonisation we be not go to get there at all if we lose the public if the light start brown out or go out and we find that we can not meet demand to some extent we be pile up that demand by decarbonise transport and other part of the system include decarbonise building heat through heat pump the demand for electricity will rise but our capacity to produce it reliably at all hour and in all condition be be reduce on the question of import and export we might become net exporter of electricity but perhaps the hon gentleman can explain how the price at which we be export compare with the price at which we be import the difficulty be that we will be import when the wind be not blow or the sun be not shin and it be likely that the wind will not be blow across the entirety of the north sea so we will be import fossil fuel generate power at very high cost to compensate for the fact that we have get rid of our own gas production and gas fire power station be not sure that situation will be very good if the hon gentleman would look at the arup report on the tarchon interconnector which will come into my constituency under the present plan he will see that that interconnector will not actually contribute very much to security of supply but will be use almost entirely to export when there be too much wind it will export at below the strike price if there be too much wind and it will export at loss and the cost will finish up on the bill of the british consumer so the british consumer be pay for all the investment pay for the strike price pay for the infrastructure and then pay to subsidise the export to the germans who will be the beneficiary of all this investment appeal to the minister to just read the arup report and look at this that be why ask about the offshore co ordination support scheme work that have be do be not go to ask for the impossible and ask he to revive the ocss but would like from he an assurance that the work eso have do will not simply be throw away and waste please can he assure the house that that work will be incorporate into the spatial plan that eso say it want to produce some very interesting innovation come out of that work but there be also lot of work discredit the long term viability of norwich to tilbury and look on different timeframe in the long term that could produce much more viable alternative than be currently on the table there be still work to be do on that but have no doubt that fintan slye will want to do that work as part of his project for the government would like to know that the minister be go to support the holistic approach to which the secretary of state refer because norwich to tilbury be certainly not the product of strategic approach to electricity grid upgrading we need much more strategic approach and be look for that from this government but it certainly will not come from this bill rise order you will all be able to see and you can all sit down while be speak that huge number of member be seek to catch my eye for those not make their maiden speech intend to introduce six minute time limit that should give those prepare their speech plenty of time to chop out the extraneous word call chris hinchliff to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to give my maiden speech in this important debate the ongoing transition of our energy system be have profound and sadly often harmful impact on many of the community in my constituency so be very hopeful that the provision in the bill will begin at last to put the future of renewable energy in the service of those represent warmly commend to my hon friend on the front bench the proposal of which be sure they will be aware for great british energy to be give duty to deliver nature recovery alongside its other objective begin this speech by pay tribute to my predecessor who serve our constituency and this house faithfully for many year the clear proof of the diligence with which he carry out his duty and the respect he earn from his constituent be plainly obvious from the feedback on the doorstep throughout the general election especially want to thank my predecessor for the work he do to support the campaign for hugh law to secure well financial support for parent care for seriously ill child and also for his work fight for the restoration of the several internationally significant chalk stream that flow through north east hertfordshire look forward to do what can to further both of those important project during my time in this place although the many year of my predecessor incumbency have all but erase it from our memory be not in fact the first member of my party to represent community in north east hertfordshire the late great trailblaze shirley williams when she be first elect as labour mp represent many of the area that make up my constituency despite the intervening year find read her maiden speech from very helpful in prepare for this moment for as she say then the constituency represent be in many way microcosm of much of our country north east hertfordshire from hinxworth to bayford contain many small rural community full of important history and culture from the home of george orwell in wallington to the stain glass window design by william morris and pre raphaelite artist in waterford in baldock buntingford and royston we have quintessentially english market town home to fantastic independent business as well as nationally significant company such as johnson matthey in letchworth we have the world first garden city build on the principle of the common ownership of land which to this day offer radical example of how to well design and build the community of the future surround it all we have some of the good agricultural land in the country with local farmer such as those near groundswell in weston and finches farm in benington spearhead the ecological innovation we need to grow fantastic food in harmony with nature yet in my experience of speak to resident right across north east hertfordshire the recur theme be of community dispirit and frustrate at have their need put aside in the interest of what other have call progress so will close by mention one debt of honour that want to bring to hon member attention at this time have be ask to keep the follow story anonymous by the family in question but believe it illustrate powerfully how the community outside our urban centre be too often treat during the general election as reach the last road canvass in particularly idyllic village in my constituency come to knock on the final door in quiet row of terrace after initially wait without answer be about to leave when be call over by voice from the passenger seat of nearby car the gentleman sit there be not old and be keen to speak but be clearly very ill between painful coughing and laboured breathing he explain to how in the construction of new housing in the meadow beyond his street agricultural shed contain asbestos be demolish with almost incomprehensible recklessness in single afternoon by worker who be themselves equip with virtually none of the necessary protective equipment rather than the asbestos be carefully remove it be smash up on site create large cloud of hazardous dust right next to the exist home the gentleman be speak to have tragically subsequently contract asbestosis which have ruin his health and leave he barely able to travel from his front door to his car despite the concern he raise at the time no one be ever hold to account for these action and he urge passionately to raise the danger associate with the rushed and unsafe demolition of agricultural building contain asbestos at the early opportunity if be elect as his mp be sorry to inform the house that when return few week later to speak to he about honour his request and include this story in my maiden speech be tell by his widow that he have recently pass away the chance for any meaningful justice for this family have now go with he meanwhile developer have no doubt pocket return on investment that much fat for have fatally cut corner at the expense of local resident whether it be profit lead development the cancellation of bus route or the closure of bank and village school the fundamental experience of town and village like those in north east hertfordshire have too often be one of be do to and expect to endure rather than one of be look after work with and empower to contribute it be this above all that hope to chip away at in my contribution in this place thank the house for listen patiently to my first attempt and my constituent for give the opportunity to do so call liz jarvis to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for give the opportunity to make my maiden speech during the debate on this important bill welcome effort to provide renewable energy bring down heating bill and support

advanced manufacturing research centre amrc boast expertise in nuclear fusion hydrogen and the construction of offshore wind turbine blade that create good skilled job for rotherham and contribute more than million to the south yorkshire economy every year the amrc be also home to the uk first sustainable aviation fuel facility and therefore welcome the saf bill which be come soon rotherham renewable production do not stop there our fusion technology facility work with industry and science to pioneer fusion energy as major source of low carbon electricity templeborough power station biomass plant sustainably convert waste wood into energy it use recycle sawdust wood chipping and scrap that would go into landfill and be use in my constituency by esken renewables to fuel the power station in do so it save tonne of carbon dioxide every year the research and innovation take place every day in rotherham give it unique role to play in this government ambitious energy plan and there be an open invitation to the secretary of state and ministers to visit the opportunity in my constituency ask the minister to include community energy as one of the specific objective in clause of the bill an inquiry by the environmental audit committee outline the enormous contribution that community energy scheme can bring while reduce dependency on international energy import express my gratitude to ministers for not pursue the legal challenge on the closure of the rosebank oilfield when the conservatives be in power they grant new oil and gas licence to site such as rosebank but over third of licence grant overlap with marine protect area and fail to consider the impact on biodiversity and marine health mpa be intend to protect rare threatened and important specie from damage cause by human activity instead innumerable careless decision by the last government lead to spill over the previous year result in tonne of oil be spill and devastating biodiversity decline in the very area we should be protect the most like many in the chamber believe that solar energy have key role to play in our transition to low carbon economy however be concerned that without incorporate human right mechanism in the bill the transition will not be clean or just it be well document that solar photovoltaic supply chain have sinister dependency on force labour programme in the xinjiang autonomous region of china where the chinese government be systematically persecute million of uyghur turkic and majority people on the basis of their religion and ethnicity the people republic of china global market share across the solar pv supply chain exceed the uyghur region have become the dominant global source location for critical input for the solar industry an estimated of global polysilicon use in almost all solar panel worldwide be produce in xinjiang china rapid success in the industry have be achieve with low cost subsidise dirty coal completely undermine the green credential it boast as early as the us enact the uyghur forced labour prevention act which place ban on the importation of product from the uyghur region include shipment of solar panel with connection to xinjiang the legislation have be highly effective with the market respond with new ethical supply chain canada the eu and mexico have follow suit with similar regulation but we have fall behind urge the minister to address that failing now that evidence have emerge of global supply chain bifurcate with tainted solar good be redirect to country with weak regulation such as the uk our nation have become dumping ground for dodgy solar with this bill it be vital that we make turn on the mistake of our predecessor welcome the secretary of state for business and trade say this morning that he expect and demand no modern slavery in any part of our solar supply chain he express willingness to extend legislation to help tackle the problem we must raise standard with this bill by commit to the production and supply of clean energy that be free from slavery and state impose forced labour at any stage of the supply chain and will be table amendment to that effect in tandem we must seriously consider implement an import ban like the us prevention act it would need to ban renewable energy product make in whole or in part with state impose uyghur force labour hope the minister will meet to discuss that far it be hard to overstate the importance of the energy sector to my constituent and indeed to the whole of north east scotland so be grateful to be call today first must address the report that great british energy might be headquarter in aberdeen the government be still yet to confirm that say that it be speculation but the manner in which they have manage this announcement speak volume the ambiguity and the joking about when an announcement might be make and then just say that the headquarters will be in scotland do absolutely nothing to help the speculation and delay decision or give the industry any confidence these layer of uncertainty be drive away investment and create less secure job environment in north east scotland aberdeen have always be the energy capital of europe it have be that way for half century so it be the most logical choice for the headquarters have significant reservation and concern which will outline today the north sea oil and gas industry be not just part of the economy in aberdeenshire but the bedrock on which our community and my constituent in gordon and buchan have build their livelihood for generation it be not just about the direct job in the industry and the associate service in the hospitality sector for example an overall economic ecosystem have develop and that be why it be critical that we manage the energy transition properly so that the north east of scotland do not become the next region to suffer industrial decline as the mining area do be sure that the secretary of state the minister and the labour party do not want that on their record the government plan for great british energy couple with the energy profit levy put the industry at risk at this vital time the propose increase and the removal of the investment allowance could be death knell for investment in our area let be clear this be not about protect the profit of large company just for profit sake it be about protect the job and skill and future of our community offshore energies uk have warn that the tax increase could see investment in the uk cut and that they might fall from billion to billion between now and that be not scaremongere it be what the industry be face we can take today figure of billion of private investment and compare that with what the government be suggest billion of public investment into gb energy just to create an investment vehicle we already have an investment stream in the north east of scotland it be not government money that be need but stable fair globally competitive market for our national and multinational company they will do the business public money to create gb energy while simultaneously introduce these punitive taxation and other measure that be project to drive away investment just do not make sense because the same investment in capital skill and personnel that we need for our energy security today be also vital for an effective and efficient transition to clean energy have number of question for the government about great british energy and will start with job security and creation how will great british energy protect exist job in aberdeenshire energy sector we have already see significant loss of job due to the oil price downturn and market uncertainty the government boast that great british energy will create new job of which be project to be in scotland but we need specific figure have be provide at regional level across england but we have only one figure for the whole of scotland the distribution of job in scotland be currently heavily weight towards aberdeen aberdeenshire and the north east so no matter how many job might or might not be generate by gb energy in scotland my constituent want and need to know where those job will be can the minister confirm when he sum up how many of the job will be in aberdeenshire and the north east what type of role they will be and when they will be create already oil and gas worker be lose their job and move abroad to maintain or progress their career they be the worker we need for the transition secondly we must consider the economic impact on our local community for example how will the wealth that flow into our local infrastructure and economy and community project be replicate in the future under great british energy look at the national picture the oil and gas authority estimate that the total revenue from oil and gas production in the five year to be billion be the secretary of state and the chancellor willing to sacrifice that in the pursuit of an accelerated transition that would be significant dent in the billion of public investment we need balanced approach we be not against the energy transition and we recognise that the transition will take time but rush it could have severe consequence for community such as mine in gordon and buchan we be after net zero not absolute zero they be different thing and we do not need to banish oil and gas from our energy mix immediately in order prematurely to be on the road to net zero the people of gordon and buchan and indeed all of north east scotland be not against change we have be at the forefront of energy innovation for decade but we need the transition to work for our community and to build their strength rather than dismantle they we must protect job call on the government to provide clear answer not just high level projection on how we expect great british energy to benefit not harm the exist industry in gordon and buchan our community have so much to lose if we get this wrong and they deserve our help with comprehensive plan not ideology call uma kumaran to make her maiden speech be grateful for the opportunity to make my maiden speech with my parent and husband in the gallery today congratulate the hon member for eastleigh liz jarvis who give an impassioned speech show how deeply she care for her community its heritage and in particular the

campaign and amid lou experience extreme morning sickness so be the supportive partner that be assure lou that this would be first trimester of absolute peace tranquillity and calm as there be absolutely no way that the prime minister would call general election in the summer we all know how that turn out put on record my apology to lou for break that promise will endeavour to ensure that be the first and last time break my word to constituent cheadle be truly brilliant place we have wonderful green space brilliant school and some fantastic high street but what make the constituency so special be the people the area be build on the foundation of so many community group and organisation all campaign and work to make our community well place for everyone there be allotment group such as billy lane who invite local school to learn about grow food and healthy eat there be cheadle civic society lead by the inspirational phillip gould bourn who protect cheadle heritage and historic character there be many faith group include cheadle masjid grove lane baptists and yeshurun hebrew congregation who provide support for our most vulnerable resident and there be hundred of community organisation and friend group such as the friend of carr wood who be the guardian of some of our most precious green space and rightly challenge those who would do they harm those be the people who make cheadle so special and thank they for put their faith in as cheadle member of parliament have always say that would be their voice in westminster not westminster voice in cheadle that will always be my goal there be much to do our local hospital stepping hill be in dire need of investment for too long staff and patient have have to make do with hospital that be literally fall apart the out patient building be condemn and be now demolish and in march the intensive care unit which look after some of the most critical patient be temporarily close because the ceiling be come in nurse have even tell about bucket squad for the uninitiated this be term they have coin for an extra duty they now have on shift where they each have bucket to place down when it rain to catch the water come through the roof this be disgrace no hospital let alone one as busy as stepping hill should operate in those condition that be why my first act as the member of parliament for cheadle be to write to the secretary of state for health and social care ask for the fund that stepping hill desperately need for repair be pleased that the government have since say that funding will be make available but until we get the detail and the money will keep fight to ensure that stepping hill its staff and its patient get the funding they deserve will also keep fight to get my resident the support they need during the cost of living crisis this be an issue of huge importance to when be my mum brother and be threaten with homelessness because mum who work several job to make end meet could not afford the private rent we face rely on friend who could offer couch or spare room to help we the idea be sell as fun holiday to and my brother but can remember how anxious and worry my mum look and how conversation between adult would suddenly stop as walk into the room life feel unsettled and could tell that my mum be scared and need help it be lib dem councillor call david bruce who help we by fight and get we council house because of he we have home give we the security and stability to get on in life home be no long an anxious place mum be happy and my brother and could focus on our schoolwork that experience inspire to get into politic because see at first hand the positive impact that it can have on people day to day life without that councillor can honestly say would not be stand here today but that be not the end of our story we still struggle face with rise bill mum would sometimes have to decide whether to put money into the electric meter or food into the cupboard if think about it can still hear the clunk of the pay meter go off and plunge the house into darkness mum would often joke that that be the cue for we to go to bed sadly know from speak to my constituent that this story be still be live out all too frequently the choice that many family have to make be horribly familiar the choice to heat their home or feed their child should never be force on anyone yet thousand of family across stockport face that choice every day be proud that the liberal democrats on stockport council lead the way by establish warm space programme support community organisation with the fund to help shelter vulnerable resident who could not afford to heat their home during the winter month many authority be now do that across the country but as wonderful as that is we can not sit back and accept this situation great british energy be step in the right direction welcome the move to restore british investment in clean energy and if great british energy actually bring down cost for my constituent that will be nothing but good thing will do all can to help my resident in cheadle when it come to the cost of living will hold this government to account when believe they be not do enough to support those who need it well health service support for the cost of live crisis and champion my amazing community those be some of the thing that will do as cheadle member of parliament it be truly the honour of my life to be stand here work for the place call home the place be now raise my family hope will do cheadle proud here call jayne kirkham to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker pay tribute to the hon member for cheadle mr morrison whose experience and passion will be of great benefit to both his constituent and his local hospital and to my hon friend the member for stratford and bow uma kumaran who will be very worthy successor to those suffragette it be real honour and privilege to be stand here as the mp for truro and falmouth arrive in cornwall quite by accident nearly year ago have be sweep off my foot by naval pilot who tempt away from life as london trade union lawyer with image of beach and sunset he fly search and rescue helicopter at culdrose naval station unfortunately as be often the case our military marriage be short and be leave as single mum with small son but choose to stay and bring he up in cornwall and it be very much our home become single parent be sudden and difficult but be fortunate benefit from the opportunity offer by the last labour government and be able to get back on my foot retrain and take job as teaching assistant work in local secondary school for seven year first in special educational need and later as an unqualified teacher which show the journey that education have be on pay tribute to my predecessor cherilyn mackrory she serve in number of role in this place she show her passion for the environment in her work on the environmental audit committee and as chair of the ocean conservation all party parliamentary group she also draw on her own personal experience to help other she do huge amount to shape the woman health strategy and maternity safety awareness and be integral in introduce the new pregnancy loss certificate both cherilyn and her predecessor sarah newton work to secure new woman and child unit at treliske hospital in truro one of the previous government new hospital or unit it be desperately need and long time come have my son in the exist unit nearly year ago and the building be not fit for purpose then really want to ensure its speedy completion truro and falmouth have exist as constituency only since it sit in the middle of the duchy of cornwall spread from falmouth on the south coast to crantock on the north coast falmouth be my home and where have sit as councillor for the past six year it be vibrant and welcome town envelop by the ocean falmouth have play its part in the history of great britain in the late the town be appoint the royal mail packet station receive and send mail and message all around the globe make falmouth for year at least the information super highway of the british empire however falmouth be more than its seafaring past we still have two splendid castle pendennis and st mawes protect the entrance to the carrick roads but the constituency be also the site of falmouth university build on the legacy of the famous art school that be still find on woodlane but now anchor across the border in the state of the art tremough campus in penryn which it share with the university of exeter the area brim with creative scientist and engineer whom dawn french the university chancellor describe as enterprise dreamer if we follow the river fal upwards we reach truro cornwall capital and only city with its impressive cathedral and award win theatre hall for cornwall it have lys kernow the home of cornwall council as well as treliske the acute hospital the constituency also have large rural element with an array of beautiful village and area such as the roseland peninsula where farming and fishing be still vital industry when research for this speech be strike by the word in the maiden speech of one of cornwall most well known and love members of parliament david penhaligon exactly year ago in this house he refer to an economy that rely on tourism traffic condition in the summer month that strangle much of the industry that keep the place go for the rest of the year tremendous pressure on hospital service sewage problem pressure on housing the problem of summer let and the low average wage in britain be pleased that the measure in this government programme real living wage the water bill devolution and renter right will help to address some of those issue but it be shocking that many of the issue that he mention then be sadly still very much in evidence today half century on for place on the edge of the map cornwall be too often at the edge of our thought in this place like penhaligon believe that cornwall with its proud and independent heritage deserve well turn to the topic of this debate there be so much to be excite by as well as cornwall potential for onshore wind we have of europe requirement for critical mineral and geothermal energy beneath our foot bury in our granite we only have to look at horizon dot with the ruin of engine house to know that the people of cornwall be more than happy to dig for their treasure falmouth be town with its face turn to the sea the port still have very busy harbour and dock which have business service both military and commercial ship as well as host cruise and leisure vessel but there be potential for so much more and the port of falmouth be poise to take advantage of new generation of offshore wind production in the celtic sea with the support of the new energy company gb energy the billion port fund and investment in the skill train we so desperately need our young people will be able to grasp with both hand the well pay job of the future while secure our own home grow energy and face down the challenge of climate change challenge that be so important to place like cornwall which star the impact of the change climate in the face every day we be the first large rural authority to declare climate emergency and the net zero target now we will play our part in get the country to meet similarly ambitious target falmouth time truly have come again as part of the government mission to become clean energy superpower truro and falmouth be the most magical place to live it well and truly hook and my small family and have become part of my journey despite its up and down have be charmed and happy one truro and falmouth have give so much to and it be overflow with promise and brilliant independent minded enterprise dreamer be determined to serve my home as well as it have serve bright future lie ahead for it congratulate the hon member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham on really wonderful maiden speech it be hearten to see how much love and passion she have for she adopt home in cornwall and who do not like cornwall be sure her constituent will be tremendously well serve by the passion we see just now the government must accept that the message around gb energy be muddle at the very least during the election it be almost as though it be rush through as manifesto headline rather than result from the strategic development of careful think out optimise planning but there we be we understand that there will be limit co production from the company no retail arm and no public sector comparator role it will be provider that do not do much provision and decider that do not make any decision talk about net zero there be zero detail in the bill to give we an indication of what will actually happen on the ground it be go to sell energy to the public and then it be not it be go to generate energy then it be not and now it will again think we be still in that space hear in the secretary of state opening remark that there have now be modification to the brand it be now gb energy generating company the generating bit have be shoehorn in there at the last minute to try to make it little bit more believable it that will not own any asset outright but will make return on the sale of energy from the wholesale market by the principal operator of the energy scheme it latch itself on to well can see why the labour part never put that on leaflet goodness why be it not consider government trading fund it be not company it be government trading fund that they be brand as company it absolutely meet all the criterion of the government trading funds act so it would be interesting to know why that be do not doubt the secretary of state commitment in this area have see it over the past five year be sorry that his initial much more ambitious plan for billion have be torpedo by the treasury and his right hon friend the chancellor if he be feel sorry for himself he can speak to the million of pensioner around these island whose ambition for the future have also be torpedo by the chancellor and the treasury on substantive note about the lack of detail in the bill it be great pity that the government want we to believe that clean energy mean energy produce from source other than fossil fuel it be hard to imagine more one dimensional analysis and qualification than that it be narrow and incoherent and out of step with the science and the public it do not really matter where or what carbon be lock into if you burn it to release carbon dioxide in the process of make energy then you be carbon emitter contribute to the climate crisis it be as simple as that we should not be hostage to technology where hundred of million of pound in government subsidy be use to create million of tonne of year we know that subsidy for large scale biomass generator in england will end in know the minister be up to speed on that and the government claim they be review evidence on potential support beyond this will the minister in sum up be clear with parliament today do he believe that chop down million of tree on the other side of the world and ship they to england to then burn they to make electricity be acceptable if not will he commit to end public subsidy for large scale biomass in be glad to hear the hon gentleman be concerned about the chop down of tree do he accept that in scotland million tree be chop down to put up windmill hesitate to thank the right hon member for his will need to fact check his million figure will get back to he on that but let we be really clear will touch on onshore wind in minute that once those tree be burn in former coal fire power station the only product be and electricity but where tree have be clear to create onshore wind in scotland there be lifetime of renewable clean cheap energy come out the other side so it be false comparator if ever see one do the government believe that waste to energy be also clean energy that do not seem to be what gb energy should pursue and be not certain there be much support for that in the country maybe the right hon gentleman should have make his intervention in minute because remain unclear on this point the bill set out that it apply to scotland wales northern ireland and england however constitutionally and administratively in policy term do not see how it can apply to northern ireland if the minister could update we on what possible role gb energy have in the entirely different energy market that exist in northern ireland that would be helpful community energy be essential to how we make our journey to net zero but like much else there be scant detail on that if the government have properly consult the community energy sector they can probably still do that they would know that access to consumer be one of the principal drawback to develop these scheme it be disappointing that no lateral thinking be be apply on how to connect the will to create community energy with the market ofgem have create an environment where one can deliver an extraordinary example of community electricity generation but try to connect with consumer be almost impossible gb energy if it be nothing else and it do appear to be not much else could have be part of the gig economy it could have be the uber of retail energy we could have buy community energy and pass it on to the consumer base but that be not go to happen the government want to mirror the ambition of vattenfall or edf but those company which be actually company sell to the retail market will the government update we on the paltry amount that the previous government allocate to community energy it be million just for england what will gb energy deliver push ahead zonal energy be one of the most important transformation that can come into the energy market on gb the government advise that electricity market reform be key order we now come to maiden speech call perran moon call perran moon to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to make my maiden speech during debate that be so relevant to my own wonderful constituency of camborne redruth and hayle in the heart of cornwall come to this place and be disappointed that the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin be not present to hear say this with year of business experience in the automotive sector and latterly in the renewable electricity sector thank all those who have give their maiden speech today they be all truly heartfelt wonderful speech my own inspiration for be here come from my three child my daughter and my two son who join we in the public gallery today want first to pay tribute to my predecessor george eustice for his work on animal welfare as secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs as well as his support for local project in cornwall such as kresen kernow the cornish archive and despite our profound difference on our relationship with the eu the honourable way in which he be prepared to criticise trade arrangement make by the conservative party it be an unparalleled privilege to represent one home constituency and the tie that bind cornish man and woman to our homeland be weave into every sinew of our being the constituency of camborne redruth and hayle be truly remarkable place the place where be bear and grow up and where live to understand camborne redruth and hayle respectfully ask you madam deputy speaker to transport yourself in your mind to the summit of single rocky hill smack bang in the middle of the constituency this rocky hill be call carn brea which be in fact cornish for rocky hill at the summit of carn brea sit the basset monument look down from foot across the constituency the monument be fund by public subscription in after basset himself petitioned the other place against slavery in to the north of carn brea just mile away the celtic sea sparkle in the sunlight and lap the beautiful beach of gwithian portreath porthtowan st agnes and perranporth the celtic sea which offer the prospect of vast quantity of electricity generate from offshore wind an opportunity that dearly hope this government will grasp look to the west from carn brea we see the town of camborne pronounce kammbronn in cornish mean crooked hill it be town that along with its near neighbour redruth be synonymous with our tin mining heritage the two town be once among the wealthy in britain help to drive the economy for more than four century nestle in front of camborne large flag of st piran flutter in the breeze this flag sit at the top of the south crofty tin mine there can be no fine physical symbol of the potential for the return of the cornish economic powerhouse than south crofty the last tin mine to close in the economic wind have dramatically change since then and tin which be use in the production of virtually every electrical device be now also be use in the production of solar panel and along with lithium form the cornerstone of our critical mineral industry we import tin from as far afield as china and australia with all the damaging environmental impact that come with such import yet in camborne and redruth we sit on the third high grade tin deposit in the world and there be plenty of it our sense of pride in our mining heritage which be mention by my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham and the possibility of our tin mining renaissance be constant source of hope and optimism for an area that have be damn by industrial decline for decade but back to the summit of carn brea and basset monument far over to the west on the horizon behind camborne be hayle the third large town in the constituency although the official title of my constituency be camborne and redruth woe betide if do not mention hayle in the same breath hayle be vital natural seaport ready to serve the new opportunity in the celtic sea and it include very large estuary indeed the cornish word for estuary be hayl have strong familial tie with the town where my great uncle the slade family once run steel engineering business on south quay let we look directly south from carn brea now to the gentle rolling hill lead down through the beautiful cornish granite village of stithians mawnan smith and constantine and then on to the two stunning subtropical garden of glendurgan and trebah which in turn lead down to the helford river from where thousand of american troop set off on day to free europe from fascism to the east of carn brea lie redruth the cornish meaning of which be red ford the cornish word for red be ruth and the word for ford be redruth be rapidly become cultural hub and strongly recommend visit to krowji creative hub kresen kernow the aforementione archive centre the buttermarket and the ladder art and culture hub our former prosperity be evident throughout the centre of redruth with impose granite building that be awaken with new life after deep slumber far to the east beyond redruth can be find the village of carharrack and st day which serve as hub for one of the world wealthy copper mining district from the century to the just beyond they be united downs where cornish lithium geothermal engineering and ground source heat pump company be base these business have the potential to play key role in britain economic transformation we have tin lithium geothermal and ground source heat but we be also bless with the opportunity of offshore wind in the celtic sea onshore wind solar and tidal there be very few place in the uk in which renewable energy and critical mineral opportunity be so abundant the renewable energy opportunity be not the only factor that make this land so distinct let quickly give three other example first year ago cornwall be grant national minority status under the european framework convention for the protection of national minority our language our culture and our heritage as well as our economic potential mark we out on this island secondly the positive reaction receive by all six cornish mps on both side of the house for take our oath in cornish be tell almost half our child and young people consider themselves first and foremost cornish finally on saturday my brother dickon will be make bard of the gorsedh the high honour that can be bestow on cornish man or woman this be an honour award to people who have give exceptional service to cornwall by manifestation of the celtic spirit or by service to cornwall it be these cultural difference that mark we out it have be clear on the doorstep over the past two year that there be strong desire for non mayoral model of governance arrangement with westminster my hope and my focus in the come week and month will be to persuade the government that the most appropriate devolution arrangement for cornwall be an assembly similar to that of our celtic cousin in wales in term of economic development culture and governance the time have come to throw open the cage door and unleash the cornish celtic tiger for my part will put all my energy into represent the people of camborne redruth and hayle to the good of my ability to do so will be the honour of my life meur ra thank you rise order because so many member wish to contribute ask those make maiden speech to keep they short than five minute if they can manage it the time limit for member with bit more experience who be not make their maiden speech be now reduce to five minute have be enjoy the maiden speech today particularly those of the hon member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham and for camborne and redruth perran moon have enjoy week holiday in cornwall last week have enjoy hear even more about cornwall today be pleased to speak in this debate and to have the opportunity to welcome the bill particularly the commitment that it show to achieve net zero emission from the electricity grid by an exciting revolution in the way we produce and use energy be take place it be vital that there be new support and incentive to directly accelerate renewable development give the sector the confidence to invest and innovate that come from the long term predictability that we need the bill be an important step in the right direction hope that as it progress through parliament we can have constructive debate about be even more ambitious in line with the climate science and crucially about how we take the public with we be sure that we will return to that subject in future discussion but today will highlight three particular gap that hope the minister will address in his wind up speech the first gap which have already be refer to be the opportunity to reflect that the climate and nature crisis go hand in hand know that the secretary of state recognise that point and recognise that renewable energy development can go hand in hand with protect carbon rich habitat and deliver more nature base solution on land and at sea so it be disappointing that the bill do not give great british energy remit to contribute to nature recovery alongside accelerate the scale and pace of renewable energy delivery nature recovery duty would mean meeting climate target and contribute to biodiversity target set under the environment act it would mean automatically bake wildlife friendly design into renewable energy project development from the outset also highlight the need to bake farming friendly design into renewable energy development the second area on which invite the secretary of state or the minister to respond be the glaring and gap hole in the propose legislation namely the failure to use the opportunity to more explicitly and definitively rule out the drilling and burning of new fossil fuel project net zero carbon plan have to involve cease to use fossil fuel not just increase renewable put simply fossil fuel increase carbon emission we have hear from the un secretary general that fossil fuel be literally cook our planet and far more need to be do to remove their use although we have recently see some encouraging development from the government in make it clear that they will not defend the legal challenge to for example the rosebank oilfield they could go far far so why not use this bill to far reduce the uk exposure to price volatility and household exposure to energy price shock by make it crystal clear that great british energy will not be allow to facilitate encourage or participate in any project base on fossil fuel the third area want to highlight be community energy to which other member have draw attention today like other member have community project in my constituency it be in the village of palgrave where there be community own wind turbine on the playing field hear the secretary of state talk about community energy early so perhaps we just need clarification of the government intention but the legislation do not appear to explicitly mention community energy despite its huge potential hope that this be an unintended omission and that the minister or the secretary of state can confirm that there will be community energy representation on the governance structure of great british energy notably from the co operative that be such big part of the sector put on record my support for the excellent local electricity bill which win significant support in the last parliament very much hope that the proposal in it be take forward include by enable renewable energy generation scheme to sell directly to local people and make sure that that be act on without delay in conclusion welcome this bill and commend the government for bring it forward great british energy have the potential to make game change difference but would welcome clarification on the level of ambition need in the area that have highlight thank you for respect the time limit call dr simon opher to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker thank the hon member for waveney valley adrian ramsay for his support for this really exciting piece of legislation one of the most exciting in our manifesto be delighted to be make my maiden speech during debate on renewable energy stroud have be centre for sustainability and the environment for many year thank my constituent for support have be gp in dursley which be part of stroud for year have look after my patient there through thick and thin through the most heart rend moment and through the most joyous moment and it have be an absolute privilege to be honest slightly miss they in this place would like to pay tribute to my predecessor siobhan baillie siobhan be always so cheerful and positive and really admire she for that she also squeeze the last government into introduce what be probably their good bit of legislation which be about childcare this government be continue that and make sure that we deliver it people who know siobhan will know that she also have lot well hair than do interruption thank you very much will move on hastily would also like to pay tribute to my labour predecessor david drew who be probably the good constituency mp ever meet he be still very well love in the area and be still involve in local politic he have give lot of piece of advice one of they be to be yourself which be good advice for all of we thank he for that my father actually say that there be quite lot of similarity between be an mp and be gp he say first of all both of you have surgery do you think about this more and think about what tell the doctor train as gp you have to know the first three thing about everything which be true for mps as well you do not have to be an expert on anything but you have to know little bit about everything have certainly learn lot about that both gps and mps also need to be embed in their community but probably the most important thing to be good doctor and good mp be listen not talk the good doctor and the good mp be the good listener stroud be the most beautiful area and its hill and valley be make famous by laurie lee in cider with rosie which member may have read previous gp in the area about year ago be dr edward jenner he be in berkeley in my constituency and he discover vaccination he save the most life in history so we must honour he vaccination be transformative for health one of the big benefit of the pandemic be that we develop mrna vaccine which in the future will be use to treat cancer this new therapy be really exciting stroud be also home to cut edge company include renishaw in the engineering industry ecotricity own by dale vince have be at the cutting edge of sustainable energy for many year we also have the fantastic forest green rovers the world only carbon neutral football club they be also vegan sadly they be relegate from the football league this year but promise they will be back hope they will be anyway dale vince build the first wind turbine on tinkley lane in and there be lesson there because there be incredible local opposition to it for year people do not like it but now it have come to be accept this be the future many of we have speak about community energy which we have be develop in stroud we now have six project waitrose will have solar panel on its roof and we be go to cover the hospital with solar panel there be scheme to put solar panel on every public building which will save have to put they on farmland recommend such scheme number of my constituent be currently in prison for climate activism although do not condone their protest in any way ask the home secretary to review their really excessive sentence and ask organisation such as just stop oil to get behind we we be the green government this country have ever see so will they stop protest and start build with we community be really important in stroud we have community hub throughout the constituency one of the good be in cam run by indigo redfern its volunteer look after vulnerable people we have the country old community agriculture scheme and we have big scheme that buy community shop when pub close in little village we buy they too we be also look at buy land to protect it for people to use work in may lane surgery for so long and praise the doctor the nurse and all the reception staff for continue to deliver extraordinary care to patient general practice be deliver extraordinary care throughout the country but we be in certain amount of crisis we have very low morale and everyone be complain about not be able to get gp appointment so be proud that this government will fix general practice by invest innovate and make sure that patient receive the service they receive in another thing would like to say on innovation be that about year ago introduce an artist in residence at my surgery to treat patient with mental ill health and manage to prove that it be incredibly effective we then expand into green prescribing get people to take walk we have poet in nursing home and we start prescribe allotment these non medical prescription be crucial and they save the nhs money because people realise they do not need medicine to make they well the art be crucial we must support this country world class art sector and we must use it to make ourselves well will come to conclusion when first arrive in the house be talk to some of the wonderful parliamentary staff who look after new mps so well one of they say it be strange because it be like there have be generational change in the commons wind have blow through the commons and replace what we have before with much young by the many more woman it be really ethnically diverse and there be lgbt people as well it be like fresh wind have come in feel that offer real opportunity for we to deliver real change in this country my father be he be go to be here today but he could not make it which be really sad he have be lifelong socialist and labour party member he say in will probably never see another labour government but he have get to see one let we make this work and work hard to deliver renewable energy so we can bring down the cost of power and change the whole environment of the country think be stick on the vegan football club the first two month of this labour government have not be good news for electricity consumer first the promise to save per year on bill be demote in the king speech to we will do it in due course then during the recess there be the announcement that the for pensioner to help with winter fuel cost would be remove because the government place the importance of reward their trade union paymaster above the need of vulnerable pensioner just this week the government announce they would help the big energy company and fill their pocket with extra money guarantee those energy company price that be currently above the market rate for electricity the company will be guarantee those price for number of year but if the rate change to their benefit in the future they can change the contract and they will be guarantee market for their dear electricity who will pay for that generosity the consumer today we be debate bill that set up quango despite the fact there be billion black hole in the budget the government can find enough money to finance new quango all of this will be pay for by the electricity consumer in his impassioned speech the secretary of state tell we that it would be impossible to envisage anybody vote against the bill and that in fact the country be clamour for it have to say have not have any constituent hammer on my door tell be there on thursday sammy and vote for this bill in fact suspect if many member of the public be ask about gb energy they would probably think it be new drink rather than some important government bill the government have promise that they will create new job in northern ireland even though as the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan point out the constitutional jurisdiction of the bill do not even cover northern ireland if one consider the windsor framework and the fact that northern ireland be still under single market rule many of the provision in the bill and the subsidy the government be claim could not be apply in northern ireland will the minister confirm what role the bill will have in northern ireland the government main point be that the creation of great british energy will bring down price for electricity consumer the fact be that this bill be all about have to spend money on new infrastructure to generate power well away from the centre of population as well as put in infrastructure to take that power to the consumer that will require billion of pound of investment the government say it will be do by the private sector as if that solve it all of course if the private sector put in that investment it will require return where will that return come from it will come from the consumer we already know as it have be point out that accord to ofgem two third of people electricity cost in the first quarter of this year be as result of non fuel cost they include the cost of the infrastructure the environmental policy and the administration and the operate cost of the grid extend the grid which we will have to do will incur further cost and put up the price of electricity that be why the minister could not guarantee that the saving will be deliver he know that the massive cost of change our system will be bear by the electricity consumer whether we regard net zero as good or bad let we not hide from the fact that it will cost people right across society it will lead to industry face high cost and consumer face high cost and great fuel poverty call michelle scrogham to make her

that excellent speech the vision of landlord with sword serve alcohol be an interesting one also congratulate the other who have make maiden speech and in particular the hon member for northampton south mike reader northampton south be where grow up and first go to school and be still passionate supporter of the northampton saints have long be critic of the excessive level of overseas ownership of our key public utility thank to the failure of the previous conservative regime some of our offshore wind industry be overseas own so have some sympathy the house may be surprised to hear with some of the aim and ambition of gb energy indeed it may be that the secretary of state be listen to couple of year ago when talk about this issue in the spirit of be constructive and helpful to the minister and the secretary of state wish to put forward couple of suggestion my model of joint venture partial public ownership of monopoly critical public utility be model in open the debate the secretary of state refer to the danish company ørsted which be own by the state and own primarily by pension fund with private sector management that be win win joint venture urge the secretary of state and the minister when they make investment through gb energy to focus almost exclusively on joint venture in which the other should be private sector investment preferably from british pension fund on behalf of british pensioner that way we will get the good of all world with the quality of private sector management because the truth be that government can be good at fund thing but be generally very bad at manage thing therefore urge the secretary of state and the minister when they consider the investment to be make through gb energy to adopt the model of invest only up to and always ensure that there be private sector investment alongside of course the secretary of state passionately believe that renewable energy will be cheap so he should have no problem at all with insert into the condition for investment requirement for confirmation that within the business plan for investment there be clear goal for the investment to result in cheap energy for british consumer and taxpayer urge the secretary of state and the minister to adopt that restriction and consider the need for private sector investment call noah law to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to make this my first speech to the house it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for barrow and furness michelle scrogham it be the honour of my life to have the chance to represent st austell and newquay the stunning heartland of cornwall that touch both of our beautiful coastline and that have so greatly shape my life that range from the springboard that be give at fowey community college to learn to play the violin in par and to ride the wave at newquay or by inspire to craft career in finance the kind of natural resource that we be fortunate to have there be always available with that experience for opposition members who can not quite spot it and as campaigner these past few year where have hear so many inspiring voice that help to build the grassroots platform that bring to this house it be with deep gratitude that take my place here mindful of the trust and responsibility place in by the people of st austell and newquay pay tribute to my predecessor steve double for the work that he do for st austell and newquay during his five year in office steve be hard work mp who champion among many other thing the cornish railway and cornwall pioneer model of tri service safety officer both of which look forward to take up with vigour st austell bay newquay and the clay country that lie in between mean that we be perhaps the most diverse and therefore representative of cornish seat from the tributary of the white river that ship our clay to the world down on the eastern side from roche bugle stenalees penwithick trethurgy and tregrehan down past st blazey and tywardreath to the great harbour of par charlestown mevagissey fowey and its peninsula and to the numerous namesake of st columba and her parish quintrell downs st colan and the village and parish of st enoder with summercourt fraddon and indian queens in the west we have st stephen in brannel grampound creed st ewe sticker polgooth trewoon lanjeth foxhole nanpean treviscoe st dennis and whitemoor to name few with such patchwork of ancient settlement across this powerhouse of the cornish economy the house will forgive for seldom refer to the constituency as rural despite our wealth of prime farmland that feed our cornish nation britain and beyond not only do st austell and newquay feature well know agrifood beverage and tourism industry it be also the industrial heartland of cornwall boast many of the industry we need to build green future include renewable critical mineral and the supply chain that sit behind they our constituency stand as testament to cornwall resilience and ingenuity blend traditional industry with modern innovation and be committed to ensure that this balance continue to flourish so we can ensure that this once powerhouse of the cornish economy be restore beyond our unique economic challenge and opportunity which demand right to local decision making we have distinct celtic heritage language and national minority status and national pride pride that be inclusive whether of family resident here for generation those of proud northern stock or windrush stock or all of the above like my own family or those who have choose to make their home in cornwall more recently cornwall heritage be not just relic of the past but living breathe part of our identity shape our value and aspiration as community it be therefore vital that we preserve and promote that heritage for future generation ensure that it remain cornerstone of our cultural and social fabric this new parliamentary session under the labour government offer real promise and be particularly pleased that they will deliver the large increase in social home in generation that will change life particularly the life of my generation and the next and give hope to those who never have it it be also important to ensure that the right kind of home be build and that local people can afford to live and work in cornwall reality that have long be impossible because of the vicious cycle of low wage and housing unaffordability will work tirelessly to ensure that cornwall interest be represent and the voice of my constituent be hear at the high level of government and will advocate policy that will bring tangible benefit to our people be enter parliament alongside three other cornish labour mps who reflect sea change in the political landscape there with cornish labour mps in labour government be thrilled to provide the strong voice in westminster that we have so seldom have but our political culture remain consistent in people rightful expectation of our service in our egalitarianism and in our healthy scepticism towards established politic and the centralisation of power whether that be in westminster in single individual or in out of touch bureaucracy that fail to deliver for work people in that spirit pledge to serve with integrity to listen to all voice within our community and to champion the value that make cornwall so special ensure that our future be as bright and prosperous as our history be rich and story no more shift the deckchair we be go to get cornwall building again to blueprint build of the voice of those who put here call angus macdonald to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker that be very heartfelt speech from the hon member for st austell and newquay noah law cornwall and the highland of scotland share our westerly reach and celtic background be very proud to have be elect to serve the people of the west highland and inverness in this parliament follow the electoral commission mistaken decision to cut the number of highland constituency from three to two have to large extent replace two former mp in ian blackford and drew hendry who represent to the good of their ability ross skye and lochaber and inverness nairn badenoch and strathspey respectively to say that my constituency be geographically challenging would be an understatement it take four hour to drive from east to west and from north to south the highland of scotland be bountiful in their beauty from the mile of sandy beach in gairloch and lochaber the mountain of ben nevis and the skye cuillins and torridon to the castle of urquhart on loch ness and eilean donan in wester ross our oak and scots pine tree be bent over as result of the prevail westerly wind we have beautiful loch and large powerful river around every bend in the road astonish though the beauty be it be the people of the highland that like my amazing predecessor charles kennedy love and be delighted to represent although the highland be beautiful and the people wonderful the region struggle financially the highland council be burden with debt of billion inverness population have increase rapidly but the three and half hour drive from our highland capital to scotland capital be not dualle and be not safe the rural west face severe fuel poverty long journey for nhs treatment public service cut and lack of essential service with many young people leave for city would it not be wonderful if fairy godmother come along and bestow wonderful asset on the highland something that generate serious money for the area over generation and long term provider of great employment there be such an asset the west highland be the wet area in europe and the wind be virtually unceasing we have the most fantastic land to benefit from the move to renewable that opportunity have not go unnoticed utility and infrastructure firm from all over the world be queue up to install metre high wind turbine on our hill our hydro scheme be get upgrade and there be billion pump storage site at various stage of development in my constituency major construction project abound across the highland thousand of worker be bring in and accommodate in temporary modular housing peak electricity use in scotland be gw while our peak production be to gw scotland may add as much as another gw of production capacity by we will be produce seven time more electricity than we use like for prospector to gold rush the rich opportunity be accompany by challenge there be two important issue to which we need to pay attention first there be cost to that for the highland the industrialisation of our countryside what be beautiful view of the mountain be now row of metre high whirling turbine and large new pylon march across the country to the city where the demand be secondly what be in it for the local the turbine and generator be manufacture overseas the developer and utility firm be from outwith the uk and the worker be ship in last year our total community benefit from that multibillion pound industry be an estimate million in the highland and million across scotland as whole it should be multiple of those figure we in the highland pay more for electricity connection than people in the south of england yet increasingly the highland be where that electricity be generate the government be release the restriction on onshore wind farm in england so what be an issue for scotland now will become an issue for many rural area across great britain what can be do about this propose that of revenue from all newly consent renewable energy generate both onshore and offshore should be pay to community benefit fund for onshore project two third of that should be pay to the affected council ward with one third pay to council infrastructure fund for offshore project all of that of gross revenue should go to council infrastructure fund exist renewable project over mw should pay as per the split already outline for transmission line and substation the irish have an excellent community benefit plan that we can learn from would like the energy minister to listen to this rather than do his email the norwegians handle the revenue from the north sea oil boom well and their sovereign wealth fund be now value at trillion britain save nothing and we be in real danger of repeat that mistake with the renewable bonanza close by say there be considerable disadvantage to the people of rural britain in take on the downside of host our move from carbon base economy to renewable electric alternative it be only fair that we make it beneficial to the people affect it be great that the great british energy bill will be far strengthen to include enable community energy that be really important finally inverness be the centre of onshore and offshore wind the exist hydropower industry and massive pump storage project be glad that gb energy be go to be headquarter in scotland and believe inverness would be the right place for it irrespective of that one of its first job should be to look at my proposal and to ensure that the benefit of scotland renewable can be properly share because this be an opportunity that we can not afford to miss it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for inverness skye and west ross shire mr macdonald congratulate he on that excellent speech in particular when he speak of charles kennedy who be still tremendously miss in this place he speak of political giant we all reflect on very fondly it be also great pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay noah law who also congratulate on an excellent speech speak today in support of bill that have the potential to be real game changer in the fight to decarbonise our energy supply applaud my right hon friend the secretary of state on his determination in bring this bill before the house so soon after the general election it be hugely encouraging that the government have get straight on with the business of set up gb energy follow hot on the heel of the excellent auction that we hear about just this week gb energy task work hand in hand with the private sector to power an ambitious expansion of renewable energy be crucial one the task of decarbonise our energy supply could not be more urgent scientist have make it clear that the warming of our climate due to carbon emission be have disastrous consequence that be already be feel we be not head towards climate emergency we be already live in one we should reject the voice that say that china growth mean that anything we do be futile that be an excuse never to take the step need to decarbonise of course there be role for international negotiation and bring pressure to bear on other nation but we do that more convincingly when our own house be in order that be why be so pleased to support gb energy we have also see the danger of be reliant on other nation for our energy security energy supply chain be increasingly fraught with geopolitical tension and in the case of russia senseless invasion of ukraine outright conflict that lay bare just how vulnerable we can be when we can not provide for ourselves make no mistake energy security be national security we should benefit from the great natural rich this country be endow with yet the last government inconsistency of approach detract from the investment in renewable energy that we need from the ban on onshore wind to the downgrading of feed in tariff and the disastrous fail contract for difference round auction the renewable sector have not previously have consistent partner to maximise the potential for renewable energy be fully align with the hon member priority for national security in energy not to rely on other nation of course within the uk scotland generate vastly more energy than we can consume although we be in the same state in the united kingdom scotland be different country and different nation do he think it be appropriate that scotland should reap no benefit whatsoever from its energy endowment relative to anywhere else on these island do not recognise the hon gentleman description at all we be part of united kingdom and we all make contribution and we all receive benefit the people of scotland be give an option to vote to leave and they choose not to know that be result he bitterly regret but that be the choice the people of scotland make it be absolutely true that scotland produce large amount of renewable energy and of energy more generally and it also get many other benefit in many other way that be why suspect the number of member on the benches next to he be so much small than it be previously because people have recognise overall the benefit of be part of this great union as say we should benefit from the great natural rich that his country be endow with but the previous government approach withhold those opportunity what today bill offer alongside the astonishingly successful round auction be strong signal that the new government be take the generation of renewable energy far more seriously it be imperative that the sector know it have government who be reliable partner without constant knee jerk change in policy not pushover or government who give away taxpayer money thoughtlessly but one set out fair and reliable basis for firm to invest alongside the imperative to reduce emission and bill gb energy can be crucial for our economy be pleased that the government have announce that gb energy will be headquarter in scotland scotland be proportionately the lead nation in the uk for renewable power however caution the secretary of state not to ignore the contribution of coalfield community such as those that he and represent in north derbyshire and across the north midland and south yorkshire coalfield community that be create to power the nation with coal from the dawn of the industrial revolution should be central to the government think in this arena this government have lay down demand target to double energy generate by onshore wind farm triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind those objective be vital part of decarbonise the grid by but we should not be in any doubt about the challenge they represent there be still many legitimate question about the operation of this new enterprise and where the balance will sit between be conduit to private investment and be provider in its own right but criticism of the bill from opposition members have be wildly overblown the truth be that this small bill be introduce the company it be not the entire energy policy of this government and much of the criticism have be fanciful however would be interested to know from my hon friend the minister how the new company will work across government to unlock the planning system while take community along with we be extremely pleased to speak in support of this bill and will be vote for it with great enthusiasm yes there be lot more work to do but this government have make damn good start call ann davy to make her maiden speech diolch yn fawr dirprwy lefarydd thank you very much madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to follow the hon member for chesterfield mr perkins to hear so many maiden speech here today especially from our fellow celt in cornwall and of course the hon member for clwyd east becky gittins and to contribute to this important debate the climate crisis and the need to decarbonise our energy generation be among the most pressing challenge of our time and how we choose to respond will shape the future of all our community include those in carmarthenshire have the privilege to represent be deeply honour to have be elect to represent the newly form constituency of caerfyrddin which be create from the previous seat of carmarthen east and dinefwr and of carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire although new in this parliament the constituency have historical root have exist under similar boundary between and would first like to pay tribute to my immediate predecessor jonathan edwards and simon hart jonathan serve our community diligently for year demonstrate the essence of be constituency mp which be to work hard serve all and be root within our community simon also serve for year with dedication and acknowledge that to the western part of caerfyrddin our constituency have proud history and it be impossible to speak of it without mention gwynfor evans who win the seat back in as the first ever plaid cymru mp his victory be watershed moment for welsh nationalism and be acutely aware that would not be stand here today without gwynfor so his name might make few appearance in this speech it be in part thank to he and those who work alongside he that plaid cymru today represent our high ever proportion of welsh seat in this esteemed organisation and we do not take that responsibility lightly it be also thank to gwynfor that today we be able to take the oath of allegiance in welsh and in cornish as be mention early within this establishment he be the first mp to attempt to do so in and be rebuke by the then speaker we have of course move on since those day also want briefly to mention megan lloyd george who be the first female mp for carmarthen be the second between and it be surreal moment on the morning that be sing off from the train station in caerfyrddin to find when we land in paddington that be on the megan lloyd george train in many respect caerfyrddin be microcosm of wales we have the lush green tywi taf and teifi valley rich in natural beauty and to the south and east we have proud industrial heritage with the coalmine of cwm gwendraeth and dyffryn aman those community like so many across wales still bear the scar of that industrial past poor housing low pay work and poor health outcome be legacy that we must all address we be all too aware of the effect that that extractive economy have have on wales our land produce vast mineral wealth yet much of the economic benefit be extract for the profit of other leave our community to bear the human cost renewable energy now present an historic opportunity for the welsh economy similar to the role that coal once play however fear that history have little regard to our community and be in danger of repeat itself under this government great british energy bill private company will be encourage to build wind farm and develop tidal energy solar hydropower and carbon capture project under leasing agreement with the crown estate let we mention the crown estate for moment company that hold asset in wales value at more than million in despite have power over welsh natural resource the welsh government have no power over the crown estate so the profit from lease to private company go straight to the uk treasury with cut for the royal family those power be devolve to our friend in scotland in so why not to wales the large often multinational company that the government will be encouraging to lead development under gb energy will mean yet again profit flow out of wales with little gain for our community ironically some of those company be state own enterprise but it be citizen of other nation who will benefit rather than our own mention the lush valley that represent the teifi and tywi under the current plan of green gen cymru and bute energy km long kv dual circuit overhead line be be propose which have be meet with widespread local resistance local people be passionately in favour of decarbonisation but we simply ask that the welsh government policy be implement which be that electricity transmission cable should be place underground where possible not just in designate landscape but where possible we know that undergrounding be already commonplace in many european country particularly use develop cable plough technology the uk and welsh governments should be place great emphasis on developer incorporate such undergrounding into their proposal landowner across the tywi and teifi valley be prepared to allow access to land if an undergrounding commitment be make by green gen cymru unfortunately despite many attempt by and other the company refuse to make that commitment it would undoubtedly save developer time and money if they would just fully engage meaningfully with our community in his maiden speech gwynfor evans describe carmarthenshire as county of very great natural report july vol he say it be home to the only anthracite coalfield in britain steelwork and port and that it have vast agricultural potential but he add that people see no evidence of this prosperity what they see be mine closing railway closing steel worker be make redundant as we have now and decline in agriculture official report july vol it be as true then as it be today rural depopulation remain an impending crisis in caerfyrddin be bear and raise in llanarthne have move only four mile in my entire life farm there have tenant dairy farm unit with my husband gareth who be up in the gallery with my family and friend be mother of three daughter and mamgu of seven know do not look it you all should have jump in there you lose your opportunity boy be all too aware of the shift among many of those in our young generation away from agriculture with many move to city to work if we allow global corporation to treat wales as playground for their activity without ensure that local community benefit economically socially and ecologically we only exacerbate the depopulation of our countryside we have already see large international corporation buy up farmland in carmarthenshire to plant tree to offset their own carbon footprint but without change any of their commercial practice that be not the path to sustainable future for our community and it be not the path towards food security or the good use of land we need legislation that ensure that local community derive the great benefit from renewable energy investment climate action can not succeed while we continue to encourage an extractive economy and it be our responsibility to develop our rural economy to be locally focused that create well pay job for local people and regenerate wealth within our community as the member for caerfyrddin want to see different economic model for wales that be locally own where the benefit be retain within our community and where development be drive not solely for profit but for the wellbeing of our people we should adopt distribute decentralise model of energy generation that spread ownership and benefit broadly across our community those two aspect ownership and benefit must go hand in hand to return to gwynfor word from his maiden speech he say that the welsh be begin to take their country as seriously as the english take their country and as seriously as the danes and swedes take their country official report july vol thank to gwynfor and the foundation he lay the people of wales take their country seriously we have our own lawmaking parliament and our two language welsh and english officially have full equal status in public life there be much we can still do and much we can learn from other nation denmark have root its decarbonisation effort in local ownership which have accelerate its progress because it have garner widespread public support in denmark there have be legal requirement since for at least of renewable energy project to be offer to local ownership the institute of welsh affairs have recently suggest similar threshold of around as minimum for wales that be

fraser be scottish suffragist and her picture be part of the display on the wall in the admission office in she be the first woman to stand for parliament in scotland of course she stand for the liberal party but sadly she do not make it to the chamber herself attend state comprehensive school in hampshire where grow up with my mum and brother win county music scholarship that enable to join my amazing local youth orchestra and have whole range of experience would not otherwise have be able to take part in manage to secure place at oxford university and can well remember feel like fish out of water when arrive there absolutely bemused by its architecture and tradition and often wonder if oxford be really place for someone like fast forward year and many of those emotion well up again as wander around the parliamentary estate and grapple with the intricacy of its system and procedure as single mum now myself be acutely aware that many of the way in which this place work be not design with parenting in mind and they do not always feel accessible to many of we although should mention that be grateful for all the support as be sure all new member be from the extraordinarily kind and helpful house staff part of the reason stand for parliament be to give my wonderful child some faith in our political system and to show they that anyone can be an mp be

friend this have be most entertaining and enjoyable debate any debate that marry abba stan laurel and shane warne be one that want very much to be part of so be delighted to have the opportunity to make my maiden speech in this context it be also apt that make it during debate on great british energy it be apt not just because the transition to clean energy and tackle climate change be critical to carlisle flooding have already decimate our city twice during this century and local village be too often cut off by localise flooding and not just because we need to remove the obstacle that prevent cumbria farmer from connect their solar and wind farm but because people right across carlisle and north cumbria tell that they be desperate to see that cut in their energy bill it be also personally apt that speak on this topic my great grandfather conservative alderman and councillor for carlisle be man of unusually progressive thinking in he urge our city industry to set aside coal and instead harness the hydroelectric power of the three river on which our great border city stand like to think that whatever our political difference my great grandfather and would have agree that great british energy be not just right but essential for carlisle for cumbria and for our country be the first carlisle bear member of parliament since and the very first woman to represent england most northerly city it be city of many little know fact for example in the it be home to britain first black police officer in david lloyd george nationalise all our city pub and brewery declare that their intoxicate effect on munition worker be do more damage to the british war effort than the entirety of the german submarine fleet in the beatles be throw out of carlisle crown mitre hotel after complaint from the local golf club that the young liverpudlians be too casually dressed my predecessor john stevenson be himself keen golfer and like to think that while he might be stickler for the rule he would have recognise the fledgling talent of the fab four and would not have be so hasty in demand their removal say this because john be strong advocate for the potential of our young people and play an important role in secure the new pears medical school at the university of cumbria which will open its door next year in over year of city history the university of cumbria be relative newcomer and its creation be testimony to the work of the last labour mp for carlisle eric martlew who do so much to secure university for our city look forward very much to the opening of the new medical school and the contribution that it will make to our government mission to rebuild our nhs and train the next generation like my own daughter of home grow doctor nurse and paramedic my constituency lie between the lake district and hadrian wall it be plentiful in sheep and cattle and be populate by folk know for good craic and love of xl crisp for the uninitiated let explain that the xl crisp be savoury cheesy no onion delight whose availability in the catering outlet of this house shall passionately campaign for shall also campaign for more critical matter such as the completion of our flood defence defence that be promise but not deliver by the last government the rebuilding of nhs dentistry across north cumbria and the growth of carlisle night time and visitor economy carlisle and north cumbria already have much to offer visitor challenge member to name another uk city than can boast not only citadel city wall and norman castle but victorian railway station cathedral and original turkish baths at this point must declare an interest as chair of the charity work towards the refurbishment and reopening of carlisle historic turkish bath it be one of only original bath still in work order in the uk the only one leave in the north west of england and the only one with tile interior make by the company responsible for the exquisite tile here at the palace of westminster we be also bless with rich industrial heritage over the year carlisle have be hub of food manufacturing with the sweet manufacturer teasdale famous for its liquorice nipits cavaghan gray which produce not just any ready meal but ready meal and carr biscuit home of the table water and employer of generation of cracker packer could not be prouder to represent the city where be bear and raise owe debt to robert ferguson school and trinity school for help working class child from denton holme to become the first in her family to go to university without university would not have become involve in politic and would not have have the privilege of campaign for john smith great parliamentarian to become leader of our party nor would have realise the ambition of my distant cousin ernest lowthian who be labour first parliamentary candidate for carlisle back in in conclusion return to my great grandfather at the opening of one of the bridge that cross the river whose energy he seek to harness he say our job as servant of our great border city be to leave it little well than we find it that madam deputy speaker be the task that have set myself rise order to allow time for one more maiden speech the next speaker have agree to speak for two minute thank you so much llinos medi congratulate the hon member for carlisle ms minns on her maiden speech thank she for share her passion and for her mention of the delicatessen in her area after long afternoon ynys môn be know as the energy island because of its rich natural energy potential its powerful predictable tide and the proud history of nuclear production on the island the wylfa site have be political game for over decade back in we be so close to the finish line but the site lack political support from the government at the time the community have witness the false dawn of wylfa newydd and there be uncertainty regard site under this labour government the government fact sheet for the bill say that great british energy function will include explore how great british energy and great british nuclear will work together the people of ynys môn do not want more consideration they want clear commitment and timeline urge the government to give ynys môn straight answer about the future of the wylfa site and clear timeline be pleased that the hydrowing tidal project win mw in the late contract for difference auction this technology will produce energy for the community own morlais project off the coast of holyhead however wales receive only of the total auction allocation and no contract be award to welsh float offshore wind project we be promise that labour government in westminster and labour government in wales would benefit wales this be yet to be see commitment for gbe to massively expand local and community ownership energy alongside devolution of the crown estate would ensure that ownership and profit from energy project be in the hand of the people of wales and could help low bill urge this government to make sure that those decision be put in local hand but not to rush the decision on large solar panel because food security be paramount and lose valuable agricultural land could mean decline in the economy of ynys môn ultimately the immense natural energy potential of ynys môn and the rest of wales can be truly realise only if control of welsh natural resource be hold by welsh community back with sufficient public investment to meet our climate and economic goal hope be within the time limit madam deputy speaker that be magnificent to make his maiden speech call mark sewards who have five minute thank you madam deputy speaker in the interest of save time be sure you will grant permission to skip to the part of my speech where celebrate my

the most beautiful constituency in the country everybody of course know that be west aberdeenshire and kincardine but listen to everybody be great reminder of the fact that there be so much more that unite we than divide we we be all privileged to serve in this place and we be all privileged to serve the constituent who send we here for however long or short however read through the list of the constituency whose member give their maiden speech today feel like read the list of all the part of the country where either speak or campaign over the last year the fact they be now all represent by party not my own perhaps say something about my campaigning ability clwyd east northampton south north east hertfordshire eastleigh stratford and bow cheadle truro and falmouth camborne and redruth stroud barrow and furness st austell and newquay inverness skye and west ross shire caerfyrddin ayr carrick and cumnock frome and east somerset carlisle ynys môn and leeds south west and morley all fantastic maiden speech welcome to the house of commons it be just unfortunate that on such an auspicious and proud day for those member we have to spend our time talk about an unnecessary and costly gimmick that will not improve our energy security and will do nothing to reduce consumer bill or our carbon emission we hear the liberal democrats claim that we leave mess for the government to clean up when it come to energy well if have the first to fifth large offshore wind farm in the world the fast reduction of carbon emission in the an end to coal fire power production and net zero in law be mess would like to see good job well do we hear great claim from the secretary of state that gb energy will incentivise investment and speed up the deployment of new technology while scale up more mature one all of which be debatable to say the least as the public out there watch their bill go up again the labour party claim through the election that create this company will automatically lead to low bill we hear again and again that bill will be low funny that we do not hear that figure bandy around as frequently today that be the most questionable claim if not as the secretary of state use to claim by how much will bill fall as result of establish this company and by when how will this company speed up deployment what will it do differently give that we already have the first to fifth large offshore wind farm generate power here right now without this costly gimmick although respect the ambition and agree that we need to see more job for british worker and the establishment of uk base supply chain which be why we create the sustainable industry reward that will come in at allocation round do the minister acknowledge that this will take time and that we be hundred of thousand of worker short of the plan that we have to build right now and that this will make no difference to the government plan the secretary of state claim not to be neutral about where thing be make ring hollow to the supply chain in and around aberdeen which be worried about the future of north sea oil and gas because of his government decision the announcement with much fanfare that gb energy will establish an unprecedented partnership with the crown estate be fantastic but what do that mean for scotland where the crown estate be devolve the private sector project be in the secretary of state word guarantee to return profit so why do they need to be de risk by the taxpayer what will be the cost to the taxpayer when inevitably some of these new technology fail what will be the company final bill for taxpayer although billion be large amount of money just think how many pensioner could heat their home for that amount for example the tuc no less conduct an analysis last year that find that gb energy will need around billion to billion of investment between and to scale it up to the level need to do all the miraculous thing that the government claim this initial billion capitalisation large when we have such pressure on public finance seem little on the low side if the government really want to create british ørsted or edf bail out annually by the taxpayer especially give that billion be plan to fund local authority and provide low cost loan to community leave billion to do everything else when do the minister expect his boss the secretary of state who have return to the chamber to go cap in hand to the treasury ask for more money what exactly do he think the chancellor response will be how will the establishment of gb energy impact the independence of gb nuclear will gb energy now have the final say over the small modular reactor drawdown process how be that process progress anyway do we have timeline for final decision on that or on third gigawatt scale reactor at wylfa thank the hon gentleman apology the right hon gentleman for give way some year ago young member for doncaster north approve land at moorside next to sellafield for new nuclear use but year on we be now at the eleventh hour thank to the indecision chaos and confusion of the last government who be unable to make long term decision about the nuclear future of our country but be now lecture this government why be the shadow minister defend the last government approach when it be so apparent that new approach be need thank the hon gentleman for his question he be right the first time hon gentleman not right hon gentleman be very pleased to visit sellafield and moorside in his constituency and be proud to be the first minister for nuclear in the history of this country be proud to launch great british nuclear and to announce the small modular reactor drawdown scheme our route to market for alternative energy that we would build third gigawatt scale reactor at wylfa and that we would carry on with thing at sizewell now it be in the hand of the hon gentleman party to take the decision necessary to move the nuclear industry to the next level move forward on our proud world lead agenda for reinvestment and our revolutionising of this country nuclear industry of which he be rightly proud on that point will the shadow minister give way will not because that will eat into his own minister time to respond oh maybe will as it be the hon gentleman who be ask the shadow minister be such generous man he be list all the commitment he make but we all know that his government make billion worth of commitment that they have no idea how they would pay for why do he not tell the truth truth be quite an interesting word come from the party that have decide to prioritise train driver over pensioner and that on the very day it announce increase in junior doctor pay tell the pensioner of this country they would be go cold this winter to go back to the matter at hand what will be the relationship between gb energy and uk industrial fusion solutions or the international atomic energy agency how will that affect the plan for step the spherical tokamak for energy production at west burton the secretary of state want the uk to export more energy but have he do an analysis of the impact on bill payer of build the require infrastructure and interconnector will gb energy and not ofgem now be the final decision maker when it come to the approval of new international interconnector to the continent if so how will it be hold responsible for those decision by the department and by parliament know the minister be respectful person so ask he sincerely to please end the disrespect be show to the people of aberdeen with the will they will they game be play around the location of gb energy headquarters politic aside that area of the country be already worried about its economic future my plea to he as my hon friend the member for gordon and buchan harriet cross ask early be to end that situation and make an announcement as soon as possible ultimately the simple question the minister will have to answer after have consider all the point make by hon member this afternoon be why why be the government do this britain be already world leader in clean energy production we be already lead the world in cut our carbon emission we already export energy we be build new technology at unprecedented rate we have halve our emission and do so while grow the economy the secretary of state regularly and rightly claim that it be britain over reliance on gas that have lead to bill payer here pay high bill than in other country as say he be not wrong it be acknowledge by the climate change committee that we will be reliant on gas for significant proportion of our energy supply for many year to come so his decision for the north sea will leave we in the short term even more reliant on foreign import and on the country and regime he claim he want to free we from and there will be low tax return for the treasury from small sector job capability and skill will be lose overseas and bill will not fall certainly not by the he claim during the election so if there be nothing in gb energy for bill payer it do not have the capital to enable it to be an ørsted or an edf we be already world leader it will open the taxpayer up to huge risk invest in emerge technology might fail and it will not increase our energy security the question be why do it what be the point in gb energy surely the secretary of state be not that desperate to have something to put on his ed stone or to have new plaque to unveil it may well be about the ed stone but the secretary of state should be aware that this bill could be the government tombstone we have see how these project end up robin hood energy collapse leave nottingham city council with bill of million and the same with bristol energy what will the bill for the country be if gb energy follow the same path great british energy will not produce any energy it will not cut household energy bill by as the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer and the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have all state and it will not compensate for the amount of investment in energy project that will be deter by the government plan to prematurely shut down the uk oil and gas sector it be an unjustified use of taxpayer money at time when the government be withdraw the winter fuel payment for million pensioner as energy bill rise echo the word of the secretary of state and urge member on the government benches to ignore their whip and vote for our amendment this evening may begin by thank right hon and hon member who have participate in this extremely wide range debate this afternoon particularly pay tribute to all member across the house who make their maiden speech in this debate thankfully the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie have already run through all the constituency name so do not need to do that again however do want to highlight specifically some of the really emotional contribution that we hear from hon member particularly my hon friend the members for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff and for stratford and bow uma kumaran and the hon member for eastleigh liz jarvis who speak so passionately as many do about their pride in their community and the importance of this moment and this decisive decade in tackle irreversible climate change there will come point in this parliament when we will not have debate that be dominate by maiden speech and will really regret that because every time sit here learn lot more about the country in which we live thank all those member for share their community with we this afternoon this have be thorough and interesting discussion about the principle behind this bill and the establishment of great british energy the uk face immense challenge from energy insecurity and our over reliance on volatile fossil fuel market to the cost of live crisis and climate crisis this government be determined to address those challenge with clean energy be key part of the solution other country have already seize the opportunity of publicly own energy generation company which have leave britain behind unlike previous government this government be commit to the benefit of public ownership in the uk and we want uk citizen and taxpayer to own part of our infrastructure too great british energy will drive clean energy deployment boost energy independence and generate benefit for all part of the united kingdom it will deliver for the british people create good job deliver profit and demonstrate international leadership will the minister give way will carry on just now because we have very short time before we finish wish to address the reason amendment table in the name of the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho shall address many of these point in more detail but in short great british energy will produce clean energy protect bill payer in the long term and invest in project that expect return on investment generate revenue and deliver for the people of this country in the process we will manage the transition in the north sea in way that be prosperous and just and enable our offshore worker to retrain into the industry of the future in long term sustainable way urge the house to vote against this so call reason amendment tonight turn to some of the specific point that have be raise be sorry that will not be able to get to all of they because have very little time we have already announce substantial amount of detail on gb energy beyond this bill include publish its found statement announce the first major partnership with the crown estate confirm that it will be headquarter in scotland and appoint jürgen maier as the start up chair this bill be the next stage of great british energy journey give it the statutory footing that be need to deliver on our ambition it be draft to help establish great british energy and set out the necessary legal framework gb energy will be an operationally independent company just as great british nuclear and the uk infrastructure bank be it will be accountable to parliament not run by ministers as some member have claim today it will be oversee by an experienced board benefit from industry lead expertise and experience right across its remit bring the most skilled and experienced individual to the heart of the decision that it will make gb energy will not be trading fund as suggest by the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan instead as have already say it will be an operationally independent energy company that own manage and operate clean energy project suppose the confusion arise from the fact that the snp commitment to set up publicly own energy company have not come to anything at all think it have be seven year since it be announce only this week the scottish government draw down even more money from the scotwind inheritance to plug the gap in their day to day spending will the minister give way we have hear from the hon gentleman already there be multiple question in this debate about how great british energy will lower bill and when taxpayer will see difference that feature in the reason amendment table by the opposition conservative members want to raise the issue of bill as if they have be nowhere for the past year their record be why people up and down this country be pay more in their bill and the people will not forget it will the minister give way will not give way be very short on time in an unstable world the only way to guarantee our energy security and protect bill payer from future energy shock be to speed up our transition away from fossil fuel and towards home grow clean energy we have be clear that we can not flick switch and fix year of dither and delay overnight but we have set about start to do so and we will continue throughout support the transition great british energy will save family money by ensure that electricity bill be no long expose to those kind of price if conservative member want to put number on this let we just ask they to go back to their constituency and ask their constituent how much more they be pay in their bill thank to year of conservative government on the question of job number of hon member rightly raise the importance of invest in our supply chain and in the skill of the future great british energy will create thousand of good job and build supply

of the energy mix ensure that energy project deliver not just community benefit but the social outcome that local community need many member mention that on that point will the minister give way have say that do not have time the hon gentleman give speech in which he raise number of point and be happy to come back to he at another time community energy also reduce pressure on the transmission grid and the need for expensive investment so community ownership will be critical great british energy will deliver step change in investment in local and community energy project put local authority and community at the heart of the energy transition finally will address few point on devolution which be raise by the hon member for angus and perthshire glens the right hon member for east antrim sammy

this house do now foxcroft be delighted to welcome the minister to her place and be pleased to be able to raise these important issue on behalf of my constituent in great grimsby and cleethorpes and also the wide region the minister will be aware that road and rail connectivity to great grimsby and cleethorpes have be long stand issue which many before we have try and fail to resolve but be hopeful that we will be able to move thing on substantially for the great wellbeing and economic benefit of northern lincolnshire and the humber generally the minister know that despite be out on the coast northern lincolnshire play critical part in the nation energy and fuel generation be the country centre of offshore wind operational management and repair we produce rich food for the country dinner plate and eco fibre for our clothe we host the world large port by tonnage we be the hub for new vehicle distribution around the uk we be the star coastal beachy getaway someone in the chamber may want to challenge on that at some point for hundred of thousand of visitor each year deliver excellent hospitality we deliver national training in offshore wind and high skill engineering as thriving and proud footballe town we draw crowd weekly from all over the country keen to support their team down at blundell park my point in highlight all these activity be to demonstrate the economic importance of the humber and the south bank in particular not only to those local who benefit from the work and the product but to the whole country we know that be easily able to access place be key to secure additional inward investment grow economic prosperity for and on behalf of the people who live there it dispel some of the sense of be separate or isolate from the rest of the country currently despite the fact that we have busy dual carriageway link we to the central spine of the country regular ish direct rail service across to liverpool in hour minute via doncaster sheffield and manchester and to leicester in hour minute via lincoln and nottingham the minister will be pleased to know that and brilliant little airport in kirmington that have flight direct to schiphol and aberdeen we be still consider hard to access add in some roadwork or rail replacement service and somewhere with well fast transport link tip the balance and end up get the investment the current situation for an away fan drive to support their team at blundell park let we say bradford there be recent match that we be triumphant in down the on to cleethorpe road and then grimsby road be an inexplicably loud judder journey along year old concrete road the urban myth of the road be that an american firm be contract to lay experimental surfacing and roll it the wrong way so the friction be high and more pronounced as the car drive the opposite way to how they do in the states so it generate much more noise but whatever the history the fact of the matter be that today despite some patchy resurfacing in short stretch the noise for driver be so loud that speak at normal volume to passenger sit right next to they be impossible and hear travel alert on the radio be also impossible be convinced that it must be damaging to the hearing of people who regularly drive on that road for work education or leisure purpose as for the train absolutely defy anybody who say they have not experience delay at doncaster usually they come later on in the evening for more regular traveller perhaps that result in just roll of the eye and settle down in the waiting room for an hour or more to wait for the next connection or as the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers will know head outside to join lengthy queue and eventually clamber into share taxi with other feed up and rather confused passenger for those who do not use the train often the lack of information the lack of update and the paucity of any assistance with luggage or perhaps mobility struggle really put they off use the railway especially when they pay premium for the privilege with most international business traveller fly into london airport the route between grimsby and cleethorpes and london be an absolutely essential one one of our refinery be own by the americans the fabric company lenzing be austrian ørsted be danish rwe be german knauf be also german and sofina be canadian company from all over the world be base themselves in grimsby cleethorpes and the surround northern lincolnshire area bring senior executive to our richly experienced and active corner of the country be essential but it be really embarrassing to send they on delayed train or two coach year old chugger with no modern amenity on it the hon member be make an extraordinarily powerful and important point lincolnshire have huge footprint from the north which she represent to the south would suggest that it be not corner but massive footprint the government want to create growth and to build million new home over this parliament the key to that be infrastructure because if we do not have good road network to enable people to get across lincolnshire and if they can not get to new home the house builder will not build they in my constituency we have be talk about bypass in boston for about year so long that no one can remember therefore support she and say to the minister that actually the whole of lincolnshire north and south need extra investment in road and rail infrastructure to secure the growth that the government be rightly so keen to ensure for the nation thank the hon gentleman for his intervention he make an important point we can not grow one area of will not say corner again our patch our kingdom of lincolnshire without grow the other the ability to travel across the county be incredibly important support the subject of the hon lady debate she mention the united kingdom it be important that we look at the connectivity of the entire united kingdom in the constituency that represent there have already be an all ireland rail review in which both the northern ireland executive and the irish government have look at the opportunity of improve rail link one of those link be from antrim town through to lisburn and connect belfast international airport via rail the hon lady be worried about the state of her rail link to the airport in her constituency have belfast international airport in mine and no rail link could the government work with the northern ireland executive on the all ireland rail review to look at how that could progress admire the hon gentleman ability to get south antrim into debate about northern lincolnshire and support his opportunity to do that it be totally unsuitable to have such antiquated amenity it be no surprise that instead of come to grimsby cleethorpes or immingham businesspeople will instead go direct from london to hull from king cross as humber base business they stay in accommodation there perhaps with trip over the humber bridge for half day that be not enough for we to be able showcase our whole northern lincolnshire offering in june my predecessor and my successor actually announce on social medium that direct train would be up and run by christmas wonder if the minister could enlighten we on the background of that assertion have be unable to find much more than hope from the previous transport minister be concerned that perhaps false hope have be provide to resident in my constituency be conscious of time and want to let the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers speak for few minute because know that he be keen to contribute but will finish by say that back in the then mp for cleethorpes shona mcisaac have debate on exactly the same issue relate to the at that time year resurfacing programme be in place promise action between and here we be again please will the minister assist in make some progress for my constituent congratulate my constituency neighbour the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn on secure this debate it be an important one and as she know an issue that have be campaign on indeed when she be previously in this house we hold numerous meeting with ministers and the like about it the new brigg and immingham constituency have railway station the large port in the country and an international airport yet we be still struggle to get the resurface and direct train service to london this afternoon be look at when first raise this matter in the house it be in on debate about high speed ironically my understanding be that the previous secretary of state have approve the start of the direct service from grimsby and have instruct lner to incorporate it in its negotiation with network rail about the forthcoming winter timetable as the hon lady say it would be nice if the minister could confirm that that be the case the be an issue that have be rumble on no pun intended for at least the year that have be member of the house in hold public meeting in stallingborough village hall and highways england as it be call at that time say that resurfacing would commence and be complete during the financial year which be subsequently confirm in letter from the minister the situation at the moment as understand it be that programme exist to spend million in the current financial year to deal with particularly dangerous stretch but be tell now that complete resurfacing from barnetby top to grimsby which be essential be now in the million plus category and will need authorise as major capital project very briefly there be couple of other point worth mention the train service that run through brigg the sheffield gainsborough brigg cleethorpes train service be until fairly recently one day week service with three service on saturday that have now change to five day week service but it give only minute in either grimsby if people want as they should to stop there to do their shopping in freshney place or cleethorpes it give they mere minute to explore the beach and all that cleethorpes can offer let we get something sort regular service on that stretch of line would be greatly appreciate my final comment be on the cleethorpes to barton service which be bit of cinderella service there be so many cancellation and the timing be not good for commuter who want to use it it need to be fully restructure so urge the minister to look at that can not allow another speech but intervention on the minister if the minister choose to accept they be permit congratulate my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn on secure today debate and on return to these benches know she will represent her constituent wonderfully well as she always do and speak passionately as we have just hear about issue in her constituency and across northern lincolnshire an area she be rightly proud of and ambitious for be grateful for the opportunity to discuss transport in this region today there be certainly some attempt to broaden out the debate beyond north lincolnshire understand the desire to talk about lincolnshire but will perhaps stay clear of northern ireland where transport be devolved matter nevertheless be impressed with the determination of the hon member for south antrim robin swann to speak for his constituent let assure hon member that the government understand the importance of transport to the people community and business power local economy across the country include on the south bank of the humber will begin with the be very aware that my hon friend and her labour predecessor have previously raise the issue of road noise on this vital road for those travel to and from her constituency assessment of road noise on the have be undertake by national highways those assessment be carry out near stallingborough hope have pronounce that correctly in may ahead of propose concrete repair the noise level record be between and db which understand be reasonably loud for driver over sustained journey however be afraid that they be also consistent with the expect amount of noise to be generate give the volume of traffic the support the age of the road be also an important consideration here as wear and tear increase the level of noise generate that be say fully understand the frustration that can be cause by sustained road noise for both driver and those live near the road in the last year national highways have carry out three road surface improvement on the with fourth plan to commence this october in just few week time those work have and will reduce noise and improve road safety subject to confirmation of funding additional surface treatment work be plan for the third road investment strategy period and when finish it should substantially reduce noise level along the route the work will be of significant benefit to the life of my hon friend constituent and those of other hon member both those live close to the and those who regularly drive along the road completely understand my hon friend desire to make the journey to her coastal community as smooth and pleasant as possible both for her constituent and for those make the important business journey that she describe let turn to the introduction of direct train to london from cleethorpes and grimsby the benefit of have direct link to the capital be clear that be why we be work with industry to address the timetabling financial operational and infrastructure issue that need to be resolve before service to cleethorpes can be introduce all of that once the east coast main line timetable change have be implement assessment make by lner and network rail have confirm that lner service can call at cleethorpes and grimsby but in order for lner train to serve market rasen station significant change to platform length and height be require as well as new foot crossing to allow safe access to platform my noble friend lord hendy the minister for rail will consider the proposal that have be make with final approval subject to funding and thorough business case process that be the case before the general election and it be still the case now the previous rail minister talk of an ambition to introduce the service but be sure that my hon friend and other member understand that an ambition be not the same as promise in the meantime address the performance of rail service in the region in advance of any decision on direct service between london and cleethorpes and grimsby will significantly improve journey and reduce delay my hon friend paint picture very effectively of the impact on rail traveller when the integration between service be not work properly be pleased that transpennine have improve its service significantly over the last year but it be clear that there be still room for improvement and as my hon friend know my right hon friend the secretary of state have waste no time in hold train operator to account for poor performance in her first month in the job she meet the manage director of transpennine express and network rail representative to demand action between july and august only about of all train on the route run to time with few than arrive within three minute of timetable during that period cancellation stand at with an increase attribute to problem with the keadby swing bridge on and august along with several network rail incident will say more in moment about how bring track and train together under great british railways can help to drive improvement because they be very much need northern performance over the last few month have be unacceptable between july and august train on the doncaster scunthorpe route arrive on time only of the time the proportion of total cancellation be about although depend on the day and condition of travel passenger may have experience well or bad service than that in july the rail north partnership through which my department and transport for the north jointly manage northern contract serve it with breach notice which compel it to produce formal recovery plan it will be require to explain how it will tackle the underlie issue that be hold back performance result in the current unreliable service the plan will be scrutinise by my department and by northern leader through transport for the north rail north committee we will ensure that the need and expectation of passenger include those in north and north east lincolnshire be put at the heart of northern recovery and development let now address the daily well five day week sheffield cleethorpes service remember when the brigg line service run only on saturdays and be probably among select group who have actually travel on the service but the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers already know that because we take the trip together and stop for cuppa in cleethorpes the service be primarily intend to maintain route knowledge on the brigg line in case of diversion although appreciate the appetite for service to spend more time in grimsby and cleethorpes northern turnaround at cleethorpes be necessitate by other demand on the network include from freight service and by crew rostere add an additional service on the route could create clash and would cost between and year depend on staff and roll stock demand naturally the department require operator to match their service to demand demand remain low on the exist service from sheffield to cleethorpes which reach only about of their capacity even during the busy time most of the demand on the service be drive by passenger join at worksop and retford for sheffield or by northern competitive leisure pricing between sheffield and cleethorpes although transpennine train also offer service over similar route demand on the route be also very seasonal know from my nottingham constituency how much city resident enjoy trip to the east coast in the height of summer but they find it less appealing on wet and windy day in the winter take the minister point about the small number of passenger on the route but that be partly because there be only one service day if there be regular service that people know be there even every three hour shall we say they could spend the day in cleethorpes it would encourage more passenger on to the route the hon member make an important point that we will certainly look at but be sure he understand that give the capacity and give the other way in which people can travel it be challenging indicative modelling of an additional service suggest an industry revenue uplift of approximately year although most of that be achieve by improve the service between worksop and retford and sheffield it would increase northern subsidy requirement and would therefore raise cost significantly this money be not available in northern current budget this government have be clear that performance on the railway must improve and we be commit to deliver unified and simplified rail system that focus on improve service for passenger and well value for taxpayer as my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes know just this week the house of commons pass bill to
