have the opportunity to make my maiden speech in this context it be also apt that make it during debate on great british energy it be apt not just because the transition to clean energy and tackle climate change be critical to carlisle flooding have already decimate our city twice during this century and local village be too often cut off by localise flooding and not just because we need to remove the obstacle that prevent cumbria farmer from connect their solar and wind farm but because people right across carlisle and north cumbria tell that they be desperate to see that cut in their energy bill it be also personally apt that speak on this topic my great grandfather conservative alderman and councillor for carlisle be man of unusually progressive thinking in he urge our city industry to set aside coal and instead harness the hydroelectric power of the three river on which our great border city stand like to think that whatever our political difference my great grandfather and would have agree that great british energy be not just right but essential for carlisle for cumbria and for our country be the first carlisle bear member of parliament since and the very first woman to represent england most northerly city it be city of many little know fact for example in the it be home to britain first black police officer in david lloyd george nationalise all our city

carlisle crown mitre hotel after complaint from the local golf club that the young liverpudlians be too casually dress my predecessor john stevenson be himself keen golfer and like to think that while he might be stickler for the rule he would have recognise the fledgling talent of the fab four and would not have be so hasty in demand their removal say this because john be strong advocate for the potential of our young people and play an important role in secure the new pears medical school at the university of cumbria which will open its door next year in over year of city history the university of cumbria be relative newcomer and its creation be testimony to the work of the last labour mp for carlisle eric martlew who do so much to secure university for our city look forward very much to the opening of the new medical school and the contribution that it will make to our government mission to rebuild our nhs and train the next generation like my own daughter of home grow doctor

famous for its liquorice nipits cavaghan gray which produce not just any ready meal but ready meal and carr biscuit home of the table water and employer of generation of cracker packer could not be prouder to represent the city where be bear and raise owe debt to robert ferguson school and trinity school for help working class child from denton holme to become the first in her family to go to university without university would not have become involve in politic and would not have have the privilege of campaign for john smith great parliamentarian to become leader of our party nor would have realise the ambition of my distant cousin ernest lowthian who be labour first parliamentary candidate for carlisle back in in conclusion return to my great grandfather at the opening of one of the bridge that cross the river whose energy he seek to harness he say our job as servant of our great border city be to leave it little well than we find it that madam deputy speaker be the task that have set myself thank you madam deputy speaker in the interest of save time be sure you will grant permission to skip to the part of my speech where celebrate my great constituency of leeds south west

resurfacing know that some of the historian among we will never forgive herbert asquith not for the quality of the road in his name but for the shell crisis of which see the british army leave without the munition it need during world war one this ultimately bring down his premiership but give that the crisis be abate when the state step in to provide solution it stand as reminder that as powerful as the free market can be at time there be problem and crisis that require the power of the state to solve while be share snippet of the history of my constituency it would be remiss of not to talk
