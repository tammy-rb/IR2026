disproportionately inflate school budget in place such as london while constituency such as mine be underfunde for over decade it be the conservatives who introduce the national funding formula which

hour cover only about half of their cost and even with the recently announce uplift for three and four year old the rate simply do not meet their need the early years alliance find that third of childcare provider suggest that they may close within year due to rise cost what will the secretary of state do to ensure that all these parent who be be tell that they be now eligible for free childcare be actually able to access some specifically will deliver free childcare for all parent of nine month old until they start school we have work with business to make sure that we get this

when they be or between art and science will the initiative announce by the secretary of state in manchester mean that in future british student will not have to make that early choice increase the number of subject under the advanced british standard mean that student will have the benefit of the great breadth of study that my hon friend reference from his own experience as surfing dude the intention be that major will have comparable depth and rigour to level so that they can support progression include to university education to year old what step her department be take to support people age to in education we be invest an additional billion over the course of the parliament to strengthen education and training and we will boost funding by billion compare with we have launch

proposal will lead to thousand more family expect to access childcare so we might expect to see more childcare opening however in the past year some nursery have already close and in my constituency of walthamstow there be now three child chase every childcare place why do the minister think that be the case what will he do about it and how will we ensure that in april parent who be not already access childcare can do so part of the reason why we be stagger the entitlement be to ensure that we have the staff in place to deliver it in the next few week we will announce change to the process for recruit people we will launch big campaign of recruitment in the new year to increase the workforce and have every confidence that we will meet the commitment special needs education fund what

action see million of school day lose that be why the government be introduce minimum service level in school and college to protect child and parent from the damaging impact of future strike action we must find balance between teacher right to strike and protect child education in the first instance we have ask union to work with we on voluntary agreement call the shadow secretary of state join the secretary of state in recognise the impact of the conflict in the middle east on our education system here and the importance of every child be able to attend school safely rate of persistent absence be now double what they be five year ago labour plan start with reset the relationship between family and school deliver new mental health hub and have counsellor in every secondary school and breakfast club for every primary school child the prime minister first step be to say that he have maxe out on support our child and now the secretary of state be blame parent for keep child at home

attendance as result of parent not be clear about whether they should send their child to school with minor ailment chris whitty take it upon himself to write and we very much support his action persistent absence be symptom of wide breakdown of trust right across our school system it be no surprise give that the conservatives reopen pub before they reopen school that they have leave school to crumble and that they have allow disruptive strike action to drag on for month labour first priority will be to rebuild that relationship between school family and government do the secretary of state not believe that parent and child deserve lot well than the sorry mess she be preside over today the hon lady talk about responsibility and accountability when labour be warn about raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in and they do nothing when labour spend money on school rebuilding they ignore school condition altogether interruption the hon lady need to listen to this they even rebuild three school and leave raac within the building school even collapse in what do they do in wales absolutely nothing we make the tough decision labour can not even make single decision in the wake of the massacre that occur in israel the great loss of life since the holocaust case of antisemitism in this country have rise by and jewish student on our campus feel very unsafe glorification of this massacre have be carry out at warwick university bristol university university college london and the school of oriental and african studies it be unacceptable for university to

citizen sadly there be number of hamas useful idiot fifth column across some of our university the secretary of state have say that she will not stand for it the home secretary will not stand for it we have write to university this be absolutely unacceptable we expect our university to be safe place for all jewish student call the snp spokesperson if the pay offer for teacher in england have match the award for teacher in scotland the secretary of state would have avert the current strike action paul whiteman the general secretary of the national association of head teachers have say that minimum service level for teacher be nothing short of an overtly hostile act from the government and an attack on the basic democratic freedom of school leader and teacher will the secretary of state explain how she expect to tackle the staffing crisis in teaching when she go out of her way to alienate the profession we have record number of teacher in school in england that be more teacher today than in we accept the recommendation of the school teachers review body for pay rise the high in year for teacher and headteacher in our school system like all county council staffordshire county

with lack of vital support and appropriate education for their need what step be the government take to tackle the shortage of educational psychologist and to ensure that child receive the education that they need to achieve good outcome my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of educational psychologist we be invest million to train more educational psychologist build on the million already announce to train more than from this term the department for education have state that where responsible body discover lead piping they must take action will the secretary of state confirm whether those body be ask to look proactively for lead piping what action be they ask to take if any be find school must have suitable drinking water facility where responsible body such as local authority or academy trust discover lead piping in school they must take action work as appropriate with water company capital funding allocate to school each year can be use to fund the removal of pipe work if require but when school have particular concern it can contact the department for assistance welcome the idea of the advanced british standard assessment although the name be unwieldy acronym be use elsewhere and difficult to export that aside have there be any more exploration of what the curriculum would look like and of how many year young people would need to study for the qualification do it mean the end of gcse no it do not the advanced british standard will offer broad balanced and knowledge rich curriculum that build on reform of the last decade its curriculum will form core part of the formal consultation in the come month gcse remain important rigorous and highly regarded qualification provide preparation for the new advanced british standard when do the minister anticipate that it might be possible to deliver at least half of all education health and care plan for send child within the government own legal timeframe we be undertake significant programme of reform to ensure not only that ehcp be deliver in the right timeframe but that child get the support they need at an early stage without need one will my right hon friend outline the

celebrate and some have receive death threat as such do the minister agree that university should work with the union of jewish students to publicise the welfare hotline that it have establish avail themselves of the training that the ujs offer and work to implement the recommendation of the recent report of the taskforce on antisemitism in high education have make it clear that we will not

massacre in israel student at the university of manchester speak of be full of pride and joy at once in lifetime experience not only disgusting comment but one that point to possible extremism in our university campus far too many think that there be no consequence for spread such hate in our educational setting so will my right hon friend set out what the real consequence be mention previously that unfortunately we have some of hamas useful idiot across our campus and we will not stand for it they represent fifth column support terrorism we be do everything possible the prevent duty require high education provider to have due regard to the need to prevent people from be draw into terrorism and we will work with the university to ensure that they take any extremist activity very seriously james year old lad from my constituency have be pass from pillar to post by school that simply can not deal with his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism will the minister meet on that specific case would be delighted to meet with the hon gentleman israel and gaza mr speaker last week visit the middle east bring message of solidarity with the region against terror and against the further spread of conflict meet with the leader of israel saudi arabia qatar egypt and the palestinian authority to co ordinate our response to the crisis before we but also to renew the well vision of the future that hamas be try to destroy travel first to israel it be nation in mourning but it be also nation under attack the violence against israel do not end on october hundred of rocket be launch at its town and city every day and hamas still hold around hostage include british citizen in jerusalem meet some of the relative who be suffer unbearable torment their pain will stay with for the rest of my day be do everything in my power and work with all our partner to get their love one home in my meeting with prime minister netanyahu and president herzog tell they once again that we stand resolutely with israel in defend itself against terror and stress again the need to act in line with international humanitarian law and take every possible step to avoid harm civilian it be message deliver by close friend and ally say it again we stand with israel recognise that the palestinian people be suffer terribly over palestinians have be kill in this conflict they be also the victim of hamas who embe themselves in the civilian population too many life have already be lose and the humanitarian crisis be grow go to the region to address these issue directly in riyadh and then cairo meet individually with crown prince mohammed bin salman from saudi arabia the amir of qatar sheikh tamim bin hamad al thani president sisi in egypt and president abbas of the palestinian authority these be further to my meeting with the king of jordan last week and call with other leader and my right hon friend the foreign secretary extensive travel in the region there be three abide message from all these conversation first we must continue work together to get more humanitarian support into gaza the whole house will welcome the limited opening of the rafah crossing it be important progress and testament to the power of diplomacy but it be not enough we need constant stream of aid pour in bring the water food medicine and fuel that be so desperately need so we will keep up the diplomatic pressure we have already commit million of extra support to help civilian in gaza and can announce today that we be go far we be provide an additional million of humanitarian aid to civilian in gaza more than double our previous support to the palestinian people there be major logistical and political challenge to deliver this aid which discuss with president sisi my right hon friend the development minister be lead an effort to ensure the maximum amount of aid be pre positioned with uk support ready to deliver we be also work intensively to ensure that british national trap in gaza be able to leave through the rafah crossing when it properly reopen secondly this be not time for hyperbole and simplistic solution it be time for quiet and dogged diplomacy that recognise the hard reality on the ground and deliver help now and we have an important role to play in all my meeting people be clear that they value britain engagement the uk voice matter we have deep tie across the region tie of defence trade and investment but also of history president abbas point to that history not the british mandate in palestine or the balfour declaration but the uk effort over decade to support the two state solution thirdly grow attack by hezbollah on israel northern border rise tension on the west bank and missile and drone launch from yemen show that some be seek escalation so we need to invest more deeply in regional stability and in the two state solution last night speak to the leader of the united states germany france italy and canada we be all determined to prevent escalation that be why be deploy raf and royal navy asset monitor threat to regional security and support humanitarian effort our support for two state solution be highly value across the region but it can not just be clichéd talking point to roll out at time like this the truth be that in recent year energy have move into other avenue such as the abraham accord and normalisation talk with saudi arabia we support those step absolutely and believe that they can bolster wide effort but we must never lose sight of how essential the two state solution be we will work with our international partner to bring renew energy and creativity to that effort it will rely on establish more effective governance for palestinian territory in gaza and the west bank it will also mean challenging action that undercut legitimate aspiration for palestinian statehood mr speaker hamas care more about their paymaster in iran than the child they hide behind so let be clear there be no scenario where hamas can be allow to control gaza or any part of the palestinian territory hamas be threat not only to israel but to many other across the region all the leader meet agree that this be watershed moment it be time to set the region on well path also want to say word about the tone of the debate when thing be so delicate we all have responsibility to take additional care in the language we use and to operate on the basis of fact alone the reaction to the horrific explosion at the al ahli arab hospital be case in point as indicate last week we have take care to look at all the evidence currently available and can now share our assessment with the house on the basis of the deep knowledge and analysis of our intelligence and weapon expert the british government judge that the explosion be likely cause by missile or part of one that be launch from within gaza towards israel the misreporting of that incident have negative effect in the region include on vital us diplomatic effort and on tension here at home we need to learn the lesson and ensure that in future there be no rush to judgment we have see hate on our street again this weekend we all stand in solidarity with the palestinian people that be the message bring to president abbas but we will never tolerate antisemitism in our country call for jihad on our street be threat not only to the jewish community but to our democratic value and we expect the police to take all necessary action to tackle extremism head on this moment for great care and caution but also for moral clarity hope and humanity must win out against the scourge of terrorism and aggression the october attack be drive by hatred but it be also drive by hamas fear that new equilibrium might be emerge in the middle east one that would leave old division behind and offer hope of well more secure more prosperous way forward it be the same motivation that drive putin war in ukraine the fear of ukraine emergence as modern thrive democracy and the desire to pull it back into some imperialist fantasy of the past putin will fail and so will hamas we must keep alive that vision of well future against those who seek to destroy it together with our partner that be what we will do and commend this statement to the house call the leader of the opposition thank you mr speaker and thank the prime minister for the advance copy of his statement the brutal attack in israel just over two week ago be the dark day in jewish history since the holocaust two week of grief for the innocent people who lose brother sister child two week of torture for the family whose love one be take hostage by hamas there be small glimmer of light this weekend with the release of two american hostage natalie and judith raanan meet member of their family last week and know that they will be overcome with relief but hamas still hold hundred more son daughter mum dad be still miss they be innocent people who could if hamas will it be release immediately but they remain hostage because hamas want the chaos of war hamas want jews to suffer hamas want the palestinian people to share in the pain because the palestinian people be not their cause and peace be not their aim the dignity of human life jew or muslim mean absolutely nothing to they in light of their barbarism israel have the right to defend herself yes to get her hostage home but also to defeat hamas so that nobody need suffer like this again and so that we might once more see road to last peace with palestinian state alongside safe and secure israel this operation can and must be do within international law we democracy know that all human life be equal innocent life must be protect those be the principle that differentiate we from the terrorist who target israel there must now be clear humanitarian corridor within gaza for those escape violence civilian must not be target where palestinians be force to flee they must not be permanently displace from their home international law be clear it also mean that basic service include water electricity and the fuel need for it can not be deny hamas might not care for the safety and security of the palestinian people but we do we can not and will not close our eye to their suffering gaza be now humanitarian emergency there be not enough food clean water be run out hospital be go without medicine and electricity people be starve reduce to drinking contaminate filth baby be lie in incubator that could switch off at any moment the deal strike by the united states to get flow of truck through the rafah crossing be an important first step there be on saturday and on sunday but it be nowhere near enough gaza be not small town face few shortage it have population the size of greater manchester it be place where even before this devastation life be struggle gaza need aid and it need to be rapid safe unhindered and regular country able to provide support must step up include the united kingdom so welcome the increase funding for humanitarian aid that the prime minister have announce this afternoon the eu have promise to treble humanitarian aid and the us have appoint special co ordinator for international aid to gaza ask whether the prime minister can commit to the same because britain must stand ready to ensure that aid get to the right place to deploy british expert and medical support team and to work with international partner to give un agency the resource they need for the long term because there be long term even as we stand by israel in her fight against hamas our eye must also look to the future future where israeli citizen live free from the fear of terrorist attack and future for the palestinian people where they and their child enjoy the freedom and opportunity that we take for grant for too long we have talk about two state solution and the dignity and justice of palestinian state alongside safe and secure israel without serious path or will to make it happen for too long we have allow welcome progress in improve relation between israel and her neighbour to sit without any progress on the future for palestine and its people that must change we stand with israel and her right to defend herself against the terrorist of hamas we stand for international law the protection of innocent life and humanitarian support for the palestinians we do so because we stand for political path to two state solution and well future these be dark day but the light must never go out we must not let it thank the leader of the opposition for his constructive comment and his support just to recap on humanitarian aid by announce an additional million today we will be double our aid to the region where we be already one of the lead contributor of any country in the world the development minister my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell will remind but think that about of the un mission in the region be fund by uk contribution most of our aid be funnel through that it be also worth bear in mind that president sisi specifically commend the effort of the uk alongside the us in ensure that the rafah crossing could be open and function that be testament to the work of the development minister the foreign secretary and our team on the ground in response to the leader of the opposition question with regard to the un the development minister be in close contact on an almost daily basis with martin griffiths the head of the un humanitarian relief effort to ensure that the uk can play lead role in support what be happen on the ground there be considerable logistical challenge in get aid to the people who need it and there be area where we can make difference particularly around el arish the logistical hub that supply be move to confirm that tomorrow the development minister will lay write ministerial statement set out further detail of the increase in humanitarian aid that we have announce today in closing concur with what the leader of the opposition say there be absolutely future available to we that be more prosperous and more stable for people live in the region one where people can live with dignity with security and with opportunity that be the future that hamas be try to destroy we should stand united to stop that happen do my right hon friend get any impression from his discussion with arab leader that they understand the purpose of hamas terrorism to derail their effort to find well way of live in the middle east be he satisfied that they be sufficiently aware of the benefit that russia hop to derive from all this and the need to deter iran from further escalation can tell my right hon friend from all my conversation across the region with arab leader that there be absolutely no love or affection for hamas indeed it be the opposite as the palestinian president say with when he condemn in no uncertain term the terrorist atrocity that they have perpetrate all leader see hamas as destabilising influence in the region and want to work with we and other to prevent the situation from escalate and to limit hamas ability to carry out attack like this in the future call the leader of the snp say last week that history would judge we base on our response not just to the abhorrent terrorist attack in israel but to the humanitarian crisis that be undoubtedly unfold in gaza in our collective unequivocal condemnation of the abhorrent attack of october the house have be and continue to be fully united just as we be unite in our condemnation of any form of antisemitism that rear its head on these isle and in our thought and prayer for all the hostage who need to be return safely to their family however in respect of the humanitarian crisis in gaza while welcome the prime minister announcement believe that we must go far here be why turn off electricity and water to gaza be collective punishment limit the free access of food and medicine to gaza be collective punishment prevent people include british citizen from flee gaza be collective punishment drop leaflet in northern gaza tell people to flee or they will be deem partner of hamas be precursor to further collective punishment all of we in the chamber know that collective punishment be prohibit by international law ask the prime minister to use his office to do some good on the humanitarian side of the conflict in gaza and to answer the question ask last week give the severity of this appalling situation will he now agree that ceasefire be require in the region would characterise the situation differently from the hon gentleman with the great of respect israel have suffer an appalling act of terror it have the right to defend itself and ensure that something like it do not happen again he talk about people move from the north to south of gaza it be absolutely right that israel take every precaution to avoid harm civilian in my conversation with the president he confirm that israel intend to act within international humanitarian law but hamas be prevent people from move keep they in harm way the hon gentleman do not mention that in his question but he would do well to recognise that that be hamas policy embed themselves in civilian population use civilian as human shield and prevent they from leave when they have be give advance notice where agree and have be very clear be that we must do everything we can to support humanitarian effort in gaza refer the hon gentleman to my previous comment raise all those issue with the israeli prime minister and we will continue to do everything we can again point out that it be not just function of money but about the logistic of get very considerable amount of aid into the region the uk have capability and expertise that we be very willing to bring to bear and we be have active discussion about how good to do so let start by thank the chelmsford muslim community for host meeting that bring together jewish muslim and christian leader on friday all be deeply shock by the event of october there be no place for hate but there be great concern about the loss of civilian life since then and the risk of contagion and of the situation escalate even far thank our prime minister for say that in defend itself from terror israel also need to act within international law how be that be monitor if there be breach how would any perpetrator be hold to account my right hon friend will know that there be establish mechanism for that but be reassure by what the israeli president have say very publicly and in our conversation that israel intend to act within humanitarian law and be take every precaution to avoid harm civilian we all condemn the attack by hamas on innocent civilian but since then thousand of innocent palestinians include child have be kill by the israeli army bombardment which also condemn over million palestinians have be displace and many more be suffer without access to food water electricity fuel and medicine which be inhumane and against international law will the prime minister join in call for ceasefire today to end this collective punishment again israel have the right the defend itself in line with international and humanitarian law and it have our support in do that rise order the statement will run until so let we help one another to get everyone in how can member of the british jewish community feel safe when people be allow to chant on the street of britain in favour of jihad call for the raising of religious army to go and fight israel call for the mobilisation of the intifada and walk down our street hold sign that display despicable ancient antisemitic trope those be march not for peace but for hate they glorify the bad murder of jews since the holocaust and they have to stop hateful extremism have no place in our society call for jihad and for muslim army to rise up be threat not only to the jewish community but to our democratic value the police be operationally independent but the home secretary have role in hold police force to account as member will know she raise this matter with the met police commissioner at their meeting early today anyone who commit crime whether incite racial hatred glorify terrorism or violate public order should expect to face the full force of the law thank the prime minister for his statement agree with he and the leader of the opposition that the humanitarian crisis in gaza be truly horrifying to prevent catastrophe it be essential that far more aid reach the people who need it and it be vital that the hostage be unconditionally release hamas evil attack have claim far too many innocent life already israel unquestionably have the right to protect its citizen and target these brutal terrorist in line with international law just as we all have duty to prevent more needless civilian death do the prime minister agree with many of we include the archbishop of canterbury that the uk should be lead diplomatic effort to secure pause in hostility with temporary humanitarian ceasefire to allow for the hostage to be release and to get aid into gaza let just say exactly what have be try to do over the past week ensure that we can diplomatically engage with partner in the region as indeed the foreign secretary have be do that have result in humanitarian aid come into gaza more need to come but that be sign of progress in all our conversation particularly with the emir of qatar we be focus on release hostage of all nationality but we be particularly concerned about the british hostage we will continue to have that engagement with our partner to do everything in our power to secure the release of the hostage my right hon friend know that be one of the member of this house who take the most satisfaction in the fact that it be he who be prime minister of this great democratic country with all the power of analysis that he bring to his role we be all in this nation accountable before the law perhaps the only one who be not have to act on my right hon friend advice anyway and he be accountable before the law like everyone else welcome the prime minister statement but we do not quite get to the conclusion this be watershed moment we be either go to build future that be base on kill field in gaza or we be go to have ceasefire and the opportunity to bring the necessary aid there for all the people who be suffer now so appallingly my right hon friend know that we must operate within the law the law be clear and it require ceasefire to be implement now it be difficult to tell israel to have ceasefire when it be still face rocket fire on an almost daily basis and when its citizen be still be hold hostage it have suffer an appalling terrorist attack and have right to defend itself but as have say it be important that that be do in accordance with international law and it be important that israel take every possible precaution to avoid harm civilian base on all my conversation that be something we will continue to expect and continue to impress on the israeli government nobody be argue about whether israel have right to defend itself but my constituent want to know what have already be ask by member from the prime minister own side what happen if international law be not follow can the prime minister give some assurance to the country and to people in my constituency that if israel breach international law in its endeavour to defend itself he will stand at that dispatch box and say so as the hon lady well know there be establish process and mechanism to take account of international law but again we can not lose sight just week or two later of the fact that hamas an absolutely evil terrorist organisation have perpetrate horrific attack on over people in israel and israel have the right to defend itself and ensure that that do not happen again commend my right hon friend for his recent attempt in the middle east and for his reminder that the uk regardless of political party have be behind the two state solution from the word go it be also become very clear as he reference that iran hand be behind all the genocidal murdering and kidnapping of jewish israeli people therefore ask simple question if we know all this and we now know it be abroad in the uk create useful idiot to go out and promote its propaganda be it not time that we review again the role of the islamic revolutionary guard corps with view to ban its activity and the role of iranian bank here in the uk in the city of london why be they still here get money and put it towards terrorist activity we have already take strong action such as sanction more than iranian individual and entity include the irgc in its entirety furthermore the national security act implement new measure to protect the british public include new offence of espionage and foreign interference as my right hon friend know we do not comment on specific organisation and whether they be be consider for proscription but he can rest assure that we discus iran and how good to contain it with all our ally on regular basis indiscriminate bombing and obliterate entire neighbourhood be war crime collective punishment and starve population of necessity be war crime order million people to leave their home and forcibly displace they be war crime as well absolutely condemn hamas killing of israeli civilian and echo the call for the release of hostage but that do not excuse war crime and merely say that international law should be follow when it be clearly not be follow be an insult let ask the prime minister this how many more palestinians must die before he condemn israel for violate international law and call for an immediate ceasefire as have make very clear we support the palestinian people because they be victim of hamas too we mourn the loss of every innocent life we mourn the loss of civilian of every faith and every nationality who have be kill in this conflict however simply disagree with the hon lady characterisation of what be go on there be significant difference between terrorist organisation that deliberately and specifically target the killing mutilation and murder of innocent civilian include child and woman and baby couple of week ago and israel lawful right to defend itself and go after those perpetrator thank the prime minister for all the effort that he and his team be make at this time during the important discussion that he be have with leader in the region at the end of last week about get more humanitarian assistance into gaza and that be exactly right be he able to obtain any new information about the welfare of hostage who have be take by hamas into gaza they include many elderly people toddler with medical need and disabled people be it not important for we to make sure that they be not forget and that the supply go into gaza reach the hostage as well thank my right hon friend for raise an excellent point it be difficult to ascertain that information precisely but give he the reassurance that we be talk extensively to our partner have very constructive conversation with the emir of qatar about this issue to put pressure on those hold the hostage to release they unconditionally and to ensure their wellbeing in the meantime welcome the prime minister statement give that hizb ut tahrir be fundamentalist organisation that be ban in country and across most of the arab world why be its member allow to parade on the street of london and call for the destruction of the state of israel as have say we do of course keep the list of proscribe organisation under review but we do not routinely comment on whether an organisation be or be not under consideration for proscription refer the hon gentleman to my early comment hateful extremism of the type that we see this weekend have no place in our society and it should be meet with the full force of the law group of journalist from around the world have just be show some indescribable raw footage of the hamas attack in private screening accord to bbc journalist it feature father and two son age roughly seven and nine see run into shelter in their underwear terrorist throw grenade into the shelter kill the father and badly injure the two boy who run back into the house cover in blood the two child be scream for their father and say that they be go to die the terrorist be see calmly drink water from the family fridge that be just one of the video that have be show to journalist from around the world in the last couple of hour will the prime minister confirm that any person in the united kingdom support this vicious terrorism will be subject to the full force of the law see much of the same footage myself on my visit to israel last week and can tell the house that it be absolutely horrifying to watch when we hear in this house about israel action it be important to have those image in our mind what happen to its citizen be unforgivable and it have every right to defend itself against that can also provide my right hon and learn friend with the reassurance that as he well know under the terrorism act of and the glorification of terrorism support for proscribe organisation and the encouraging of terrorism be all offence and will be meet with the full force of law the prime minister say in his statement that this be moment for moral clarity and agree with he the humanitarian situation in gaza be dire at the moment truck have go in set against normal backdrop of hundred go in every day we be on precipice with people include woman and child in hospital die because of shortage of power water and food welcome the money for aid but if it can not get in it be not help what can the prime minister do to get that aid in in the quantity that will prevent avoidable death in gaza last week president sisi himself commend the united kingdom for our diplomatic effort to ensure the access of humanitarian aid into gaza and thank my right hon friend the foreign secretary and the development minister for their effort in that regard we in this house should be proud of the uk effort to ensure that that access be now open of course we need more and that be why the logistical support that we can provide to ensure that high volume of aid can flow freely to the people who need it be imperative the development minister be extensively engage with the un on that topic thank the prime minister for his statement my constituency have be the location for two major solidarity with palestine protest over the past two saturdays and suspect that there will be more to come the jewish community in westminster have highlight to that these protest start just few minute walk from synagogue and that they coincide with the end of shabbat service do the prime minister agree that if further such protest go ahead the timing and location of their start should be consider to take into account that member of the jewish community be still worried about their safety and that the protest coincide with their shabbat thank my hon friend for raise this important issue there be no place on british street for demonstration convoy or flag wave that not only glorify terrorism but harass the jewish community there be no place for antisemitism on our street which be why we have also increase funding for the community security trust to protect british jews from these type of incident the decision that she refer to be typically operational decision for the police and local community but will very much bear in mind what she have say in our further engagement with those entity and individual thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement and for his calmness in the face of the barbarity that the world have witness also welcome the comment from the leader of the opposition and agree with the solidarity that have be express hopefully profoundly across the house want to draw the prime minister attention to the murder by the terrorist of kim damti year old irish israeli woman have search this city long and hard for book of condolence for she but unfortunately none be to be find in the irish embassy or anywhere else so want to put her name on record so that she too be immortalise and remember forever know that kim family will be grateful to my hon friend for what he say and know that the whole house thought will be with they at this unspeakably difficult time hamas have not just abduct civilian but refuse to release proof of life or list which be clearly add even more to the distress will my right hon friend outline the step he be take to ensure that the red cross do everything possible to extract that information from this terror group one of the thing we have be discuss with our regional partner include the qataris be how good to ensure humanitarian access to those hostage and to get well information on their wellbeing that be something we will continue to press on the killing on october be appal and have to be totally condemn as everyone have today however the loss of palestinian life in gaza be continue and get bad the question be why do the prime minister instruct britain representative to the un not to support the call for very minimal thing which be humanitarian pause to allow aid to go in and ceasefire to take place to start to bring about process of peace ultimately that be the only way forward ultimately the only way forward be the end of the occupation ultimately the only way forward be recognition of the right of the people of palestine our regional and diplomatic engagement have focus extensively on how we can bring about well and bright future for the people of palestine and the palestinians but be surprised the right hon gentleman have make no reference to the fact that an organisation he once describe as friend have perpetrate an absolutely appalling act of terrorism against more than people early this afternoon the all party parliamentary group for israel which co chair hear from victim the family of victim and the family of hostage hold in gaza their one ask above all else be of course for hostage to be return home safe and sound but there be baby aged nine month and many elderly people who be totally dependent on medicine that they be not carry when they be take hostage the prime minister have already mention the role of the international red cross could he update the house on what be happen to enable the international red cross to gain access to the hostage and to supply they with the medicine they need to keep they alive can tell my hon friend that be exactly what we be try to do we be also work with the egyptian red crescent which be engage on the ground our priority be to provide food water medicine and fuel to those who need they we will continue our extensive dialogue with partner to increase both the speed and the duration of aid and to help to get aid to the people who need it think we can all agree that there be no place on our street for hateful extremism so what do the prime minister have to say to the metropolitan police commissioner who say that at the moment law enforcement do not have the power they need to combat hateful extremism the home secretary meet the police chief this morning and of course we continue in dialogue with they where there be gap in the law we be happy to address and look at they but we believe that at the moment the police do have the power to arrest those who incite violence or racial hatred there be no place on our street for that type of behaviour and we will work extensively to clarify the guidance to officer on the ground so they be fully aware of the power and tool available to they to make sure these people feel the force of the law thank the prime minister for his dignified strength and leadership in these challenging time indeed also thank the foreign secretary for his leadership there be time for peace and time for war of course this be time of war for israel do the prime minister agree that post conflict we can not go back to the status quo and that there will need to be comprehensive peace settlement for the region as whole involve many actor in the region perhaps include some people we may not want to talk to today although britain and the united states will be at the vanguard of that it have to be regional solution and long last solution and the people of gaza should never ever be represent by an organisation that want to kill rather than save life thank my right hon friend for his excellent contribution he be absolutely right the foreign secretary and be have those conversation with people across the region as we speak we can not go back to the status quo ante that be not right and it be unacceptable that mean we have to work positively and with energy on well future for the people of gaza especially that be huge priority for we in the come day and week fourteen hundred israelis have be kill by hamas attack which utterly condemn over palestinians have be kill by the airstrike and accord to save the children child be die every minute inside gaza last week ask the prime minister what step be be take to de escalate the conflict so that it do not engulf the wide region this be happen can he say more about what he be do to support any other un resolution that may help to de escalate the conflict and create the humanitarian space that be desperately need to help civilian and bring some kind of end to this conflict the big risk on escalation come from iran and its destabilising behaviour we have see worry rocket attack from the houthis over the past few day but also increase rocket fire from hezbollah it be important that those be restrain our engagement particularly with arab leader have focus on they put pressure on those who have influence in the region to de escalate those tension we have also send navy asset to the region to help and to make sure that arm shipment be not get to those nefarious actor event in israel and gaza have direct influence upon my constituent in may convoy for palestine drive through north london with loudspeaker advocate that people rap jewish girl and mother on saturday as the prime minister say jihad be call for on the street of london and london underground driver say the same over the tannoy only yesterday long term resident of my constituency have be identify as hamas operative indeed two further name have be draw to my attention the prime minister say that action will be take but it simply be not my constituent do not expect the law to be enforce they demand it may thank my hon friend for everything he do to champion particularly his jewish constituent and the community more broadly can let he know that at this point be aware of over arrest that have be make by the police over the past week or two on this particular issue on the other issue that my hon friend mention the british transport police be actively work with transport for london to look into it of course that be an operational matter for the police but the government be clear that everyone should have the right to travel safely and without intimidation would also hope that the mayor of london and other responsible for transport will take step to make sure that that be the case in their joint policy statement the prime minister president biden and other leader say that they have commit to continue coordinate with partner in the region to ensure sustained and safe access to food water medical care and other assistance require to meet humanitarian need fuel be not mention specifically however in his statement today at page line in the advance copy the prime minister do mention fuel be secure the delivery of fuel uk policy aim only or be it the joint position of all the leader the uk be work hard to ensure that humanitarian aid get to the people who need it and fuel be one of the thing that we be work on welcome the prime minister announcement today of an extra million in humanitarian aid last week meet group of senior leader from my mosque in bolton at the very end note be pass to that say can we stop just have word on the two state solution and actually have some action welcome what the prime minister have say and recognise that we be in the acute moment of the conflict right now but look to the future what idea international collaboration and leadership will we put in to bring about two state solution where there be vacuum other will fill it my hon friend be right that we need to redouble our effort and inject fresh energy into demonstrate progress towards that well future the most immediate thing we can do be ensure that there be future in gaza after hamas that provide palestinians with the opportunity to live with dignity and security that be something that we be actively engage on with our international counterpart prime minister you state in your statement that you stand with the people of palestine and recognise their suffering but accord to ngos on the ground in gaza child be die every day due to israeli aerial bombardment military solution be not go to end this conflict only an immediate ceasefire will so be you go to call for an immediate ceasefire yes or no this house stand united in say that israel have right to defend itself then it should stand unite with israel right to defend itself in line with international humanitarian law after the appalling protest this weekend will the prime minister endorse the october declaration which so many member of this house and the other place have sign and encourage all people across this country to stand up for british jews welcome the decision to double the aid in this situation but will he reassure the house that not single penny of it will fall into the hand of hamas my hon friend obviously speak with experience on this issue assure he that the development minister be very seized of that particular question historically the vast bulk of our aid have be both humanitarian and channel through the un but we will of course make sure that it get to the people who need it and be not syphon off or hijack by hamas hope the prime minister be right in his belief that these recent trauma could give fresh impetus to process towards two state solution because frankly to many of we that seem far away than it have for decade in that context what be his understanding of the israeli government medium and long term strategy in the event of their ground operation in gaza go ahead the israeli government be obviously well place to speak for themselves but they have right to defend themselves they have say very clearly that they want to protect their citizen think they do not just have right to do that they have duty to do that to ensure that attack like this can not happen ever again constituent of mine have be in touch to express how appalled they be at report in the times about how an individual with know link to hamas be not only give uk citizenship but give council house and allow to buy it at discount will the prime minister investigate this case to ensure that nothing like it ever happen again the house and my right hon friend will understand that can not comment on any individual case but the metropolitan police have set out that they will always take appropriate action when provide with information about allege activity that may be link to terrorism perpetrate either abroad or here in the uk we stand on the edge of the land invasion of gaza which will put at risk both palestinian life and the hostage life what estimate have the prime minister make of the potential number of civilian casualty there will be if the land invasion go ahead on constituency matter four week ago the muslim woman centre in my constituency suffer an arson attack which be particularly distressing because the holy koran be burn in the room that be target what assistance will be provide to the muslim centre that have be under attack in that way can say to the right hon gentleman that we will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and will seek to stamp it out wherever it occur in june the security minister confirm that additional funding of around million would be available to provide protective security at mosque and muslim faith school and the deadline for the protective security scheme have be extend to cover more application pay tribute to my right hon friend for his unstinting work in the region to bring about positive influence the release of two hostage on friday evening offer the small of hope to many many people for further release as time go on in his statement on friday he specifically refer to qatar and israel will he say little more about the negotiation and the influence he be bring to bear and the hope that we will see further hostage release as result qatar be an important ally to the uk we have wide range bilateral relationship and because of that it be helpful to discuss with the emir of qatar their effort they be take lead on this to secure the release of hostage welcome and commend qatar leadership in help to secure the release of the first two hostage but know that the emir and qatar be focus on secure further release and we will continue to work closely with they be disappoint that nowhere in this statement do the word ceasefire appear of course we absolutely and unreservedly condemn hamas embed themselves within the civilian population but that surely be compelling reason for ceasefire because only by end the killing can progress towards political solution take place so why even at this late stage will the prime minister not join the grow number of voice call for an immediate ceasefire before this catastrophic conflict engulfs the entire region refer the hon gentleman to what say previously israel have the right to defend itself it be face an appalling terrorist organisation which have commit appalling act and it have the right to ensure that those act stop and do not hurt its citizen again very much welcome the prime minister work and leadership in engage with the arab world to try to find solution to the difficult and challenging situation that we face in the middle east this be not the first time that the terrorist organisation hamas have carry out terrorist activity and kill innocent jewish people to derail the peace process they do that in when they kill innocent jewish people on the night of passover just before the arab peace initiative be about to be launch that then derail the peace initiative for the region ask the prime minister this from his meeting with arab leader can he tell we whether they be still committed to the arab peace initiative on the border if that be the case and give that we be previously commit to it be we moreover will he host an international summit on two state solution as president clinton do at camp david in one thing we must do collectively be re energise progress towards two state solution that have be the long stand position of the uk and it remain so in all the diplomatic engagement of both myself and the foreign secretary over the past few day we have emphasise that with our arab partner in particular and discuss how we might demonstrate visible progress towards that goal rise order this session must end at patently be afraid not all members will be call we will do the good that we can but it would help colleague if question be short with report that dual citizen who be hostage may be release this evening walthamstow be grateful to the prime minister for all that he have do and for the commitment that he have make to one family to help get their kidnap family member release may ask he about his commitment to other walthamstow resident some of the uk national who be stick in gaza rania and her child be terrified and confuse because they have be to the border several time follow foreign office advice only to find that it be closed can the prime minister update we on whether any uk national have yet be rescue and whether there could be single point of contact at the border for these family if they do make such perilous journey say to the hon lady that know that it will be frightening time for british national in gaza and for their family we continue to provide assistance to they and they be in contact with the foreign office we have not be able to secure the movement of any british national the other way across the rafah crossing but we have have discussion with the egyptians include the one that have with president sisi to ensure that when the possibility be there those people can cross indeed we have pre positioned rapid deployment team from border force in egypt close to the border to make sure that logistically we can collect those people and get they home as safely as possible when that happen the new army of online middle east expert the unverifie bot from nefarious source and the rise of sophisticated artificial intelligence risk seriously undermine the work that the uk and the international community be do to de escalate the conflict everybody share divisive and abusive message include sadly people in this place need to understand that they be serve only to raise the heat on the family of the people with love one in israel and gaza will my right hon friend confirm that the uk and governments around the world be work to put pressure on the tech company to tighten up their control and ensure that we have prosecution here where necessary to provide the deterrence that we need reassure my hon friend who raise an excellent point that online offending be as serious as offline offending and that we have robust legislation in place to deal with threaten or abusive behaviour or behaviour that be intend or likely to stir up hatred that apply whether it take place offline or online and we have work with the police to fund an online hate crime report portal and to ensure that they have all the tool they need to bring those who break the law to justice the scale of violence that we have see in palestine and israel over the past few week have be horrific and the death of innocent people on both side be tragedy the prime minister be right that the violence do not end on october but it do not start then either recent war break out in the region in and what be the prime minister do not only to address the immediate violence but to bring about long last peace in the region we be work hard to make sure that we can provide the people of palestine with well future because they have legitimate aspiration to live with measure of security and freedom justice opportunity and dignity we will strive to build that future for they in all our dialogue with regional partner on saturday hen mazzig tweet that pro palestinian protestor carry black flag be too similar to isis the met police disagree retweete he and publicly say that it be not true that cause barrage of antisemitic and homophobic abuse on scale that he have never see speak to hen and he say that after see the most horrific massacre of jews since the holocaust he think that he be safe in london and that british people always make he feel welcome but now he be worried to leave his home do the prime minister agree that that example be disgraceful the met have responsibility to protect jewish community at this most difficult time and should be hold to account for allow that barrage of antisemitic abuse towards member of the jewish community thank my hon friend for all that she do to champion the jewish community meet most recently with ministers police chief and the community security trust in downing street to discuss how we can well protect the british jewish community at this difficult time as well as additional funding have be clear that there be zero tolerance in our country for antisemitism what we have see recently be unacceptable and it should be meet with the full force of the law hamas crime be not just what be once call the banality of evil it be the calculation of evil which be why hamas must be defeat the prime minister be right that humanitarian disaster be unfold in gaza that be why he be right to say that we need constant stream of aid pour in the un secretary general be very clear that only bind on all side negotiate cessation of hostility will allow that aid to pour in as the prime minister say be the un secretary general wrong and if he be not what will the prime minister do at the united nations to bring about that bind on all side negotiate ceasefire so that aid can flow and life can be save aid be already flow into gaza as result of the diplomatic effort of many include the uk and now we be provide far not just financial but logistical support to increase the supply of that aid we will continue to do so it be vital that we get it in and we be work very closely as say with the head of the un humanitarian agency who be in constant contact with the development minister two week ago hamas commit an unprecedented and heinous pogrom against jewish people man woman baby and child we all stand with our british jewish community so rotherham council town hall fly the israeli flag in solidarity however within hour it be attack the flag tear down and the flagpole break rotherham council be refuse to re fly the israeli flag do the prime minister agree that we must stand up against those who wish to intimidate our jewish community and re fly the flag to show that we will always stand up against antisemitism and stand with our jewish community we have zero tolerance in the uk for antisemitism and thank my hon friend for everything that he be do to champion his jewish constituent at this difficult time be clear that where people incite racial or religious hatred or their conduct be threaten abusive or disorderly or cause distress to other the police can and should take action and those who commit those crime should face the full force of the law be pleased to hear the prime minister talk of the need to get fuel into gaza but as the hon member for arfon hywel williams say that be not reference in yesterday joint statement even though fuel be due to run out in the next few day and without it there will be no water no function hospital no bakery and so on can press the prime minister on question that he have not be prepare to answer so far do he consider the withholding of fuel to be in line with the government of israel obligation to act within international law the government of israel will manage their behaviour in line with international law our job be to ensure that we get aid into the region and that be what we be focus on do during his visit to regional partner in the middle east last week do the prime minister get any sense of the extent to which any necessary israeli action in gaza can and will be contain from wide involvement by malign actor it be important that this conflict do not escalate that be why our navy presence to stop illegal arm shipment to entity such as hezbollah be important as be the diplomatic engagement that we have have with leader across the region to ensure that those who would seek to exploit this already awful situation for their own further end be stop and that they hear that message in no uncertain term from everybody this weekend go to whitefield shul and attend vigil in manchester for the hostage the community be scared at what we be see on the street since hamas barbaric terrorist attack on israel over two week ago the community security trust have report more than rise in antisemitic hate incident and tell mama have report more than rise in islamophobia over the same period do the prime minister agree that there be no place in britain for antisemitism or islamophobia and that those who proliferate this hatred and poison on british street will be meet with the full force of the law have be clear that there be zero tolerance for antisemitism or indeed anti muslim hatred in any form we will seek to stamp it out wherever we see it great many constituent whose family find refuge here in the uk from the holocaust in europe have reach out to in the last few week to tell about how they have be personally and directly affect by the ongoing attack from hamas in israel they would like to commend my right hon friend for the work that he have be do with our ally to bring peace and stability and they pose this question what further effort can be make to ensure that once the current threat from hamas be address through israel action the evidence be gather and the perpetrator be identify so that the due process of international law can bring they to justice it be important that people act in accordance with international law that those procedure be follow and indeed that israel take every precaution to avoid harm civilian in the meantime we will ensure that we get humanitarian support into the region those effort be start to bear fruit but we must double our effort the horrific death toll of this crisis now include palestinian child more child will die while the bomb be drop the aid need will not get through the united nations secretary general be call for ceasefire so be the eu foreign policy chief and so be france spain japan and brazil we need more than just expression of regret about the loss of civilian life we need action to stop it be it not time to back ceasefire bind on all side think that be mischaracterisation of some of what some of those country have say speak to the president of france last night and also leader from the us canada italy and germany we be unite in support israel right to self defence act in accordance with international law and commit to get humanitarian aid into the region as we be now do pay tribute to the statesmanlike action of my right hon friend the prime minister and the foreign secretary on this terrible issue at the weekend shocking footage travel the world show flag of proscribe organisation on the street of london with extremist proclaim allah curse on the jews and other call for jihad british jews be increasingly feel unsafe in their own country but what have make that bad be the apparent refusal of the metropolitan police to do anything about it other than stand to one side and then issue self justificatory tweet that frankly be an insult to the intelligence of anybody who read it what step have my right hon friend take to ensure that the leadership of the police will in future enforce zero tolerance policy for incitement and extremism on our street for the good of all our people hateful extremism have no place in our society call for jihad and muslim army to rise up be threat not only to the jewish community but to our democratic value of course the police be operationally independent but the home secretary have raise this with they anyone who commit crime whether it be incite racial hatred glorify terrorism or violate public order should expect to face the full force of the law welcome the prime minister commitment in his statement to challenging action that undermine the prospect for palestinian statehood what be his assessment of the impact of continue illegal settlement building in the palestinian territory on the prospect for palestinian statehood our position on illegal settlement be of long standing and be in accordance with the un security council resolution which know the right hon gentleman will be familiar with may start by sincerely thank member who have show support over the last week it have be really meaningful there be narrative develop that think we need to challenge someone can stand for israel and still care about what be happen in gaza someone can stand for palestine and not support hamas or the atrocity that they have commit both can be true it be an incredibly sensitive time both in our community and as the prime minister will know diplomatically will he look again at the economic activity of public bodies overseas matters bill which be come to the house on wednesday and relate to this specific conflict whatever one may think of the content of the bill hope that he agree that now be not the time the bill to which the hon lady refer deliver manifesto commitment to ban public body from impose their own boycott divestment or sanction campaign against foreign country those could be divisive policy that undermine community cohesion it be important that the uk have consistent foreign policy and speak with one voice internationally have not just now but for very long time since condemn hamas for their action which have always lead to palestinian bloodshed in gaza and will continue to do so condemn of course the action against the israelis on october the slaughter of man woman and child however also want to look at the issue in gaza want support for the people whom hamas use as shield and want their right protect want aid and support for they because they have just as much of right to life as anyone else ask for ceasefire in the interim to allow people to get the right amount of aid and to feel safe in their territory the hon gentleman be right to say that hamas be use innocent palestinian people as human shield with tragic consequence we mourn the loss of every innocent life of civilian of every faith and nationality who have be kill we support the palestinian people because they be victim of hamas too that be why we be so focused on get aid into gaza as he can see those effort be start to bear fruit of course there be far more that we need to do but he have my assurance that we be work around the clock to bring that aid to the people who need it the prime minister say early that aid be flow into gaza may draw his attention to the fact that every single non governmental organisation be say that the aid be only of token amount what be he do to ensure that aid go to gaza in the quantity that be need just gently point out to the right hon lady that aid be go in but have also say that it be not enough and there need to be more we be work incredibly hard to ensure that happen that be function of the financial support that we be provide more than double our financial support to the region as well as the logistical support which be why the conversation that the development minister be have with the head of the un humanitarian agency be so important the logistical effort require to bring about high volume of aid be considerable the uk have specific expertise capability and equipment that may be able to help with that particularly at el arish airport and we will work very hard not just to increase the supply of aid into egypt but to ensure that it can get to the people who need it across the crossing we must all recognise the responsibility of global leader to ensure the protection of innocent palestinian civilian to that end may ask the prime minister what step he be take to be certain that independent observer be able to monitor fully the ongoing situation in gaza to ensure that there be no collective punishment of the innocent and that international law be uphold at all time our overriding priority be to ensure that aid get to those who need it which be why we be not just increase our financial contribution to the region but intensify our diplomatic effort with all party to allow for safe access to aid for those people and to make sure as say that the logistical effort be put in place to ensure that aid can actually be deliver once it find its way to egypt none of those thing be easy but we be make progress on all three and we continue to be commit to all of those thing be confident that thing can keep get well over time in term of both volume and scale clearly israel be not go to have ceasefire while it be still under attack and it have every right to defend its citizen however the death in palestine be increase and international concern about that be grow too few aid lorry be get into the country hostage be be hold in gaza and we also need to ensure that we stop the death of innocent people in gaza be the use of safe zone or humanitarian zone part of solution that would allow the aid to get in and the hostage to be get out and would save more life thank the hon gentleman for his question when it come to the release of hostage those conversation be happen as he can imagine and we be diplomatically involve in apply as much pressure as we can for the unconditional and safe release of hostage we see welcome progress with the first two hostage release but there be clearly more to do with regard to aid again we be have those conversation about ensure that aid can get across the rafah crossing safely to those people who need it that be why diplomatic engagement with all side be important and we will continue our effort with the us and other ally in the region to make sure that happen have the prime minister consider call on israel to allow patient in critical condition in gaza to be medically evacuate for urgent care at this point there be no people leave gaza the other way across the rafah crossing that include the people whom the hon gentleman point to but also british national we continue to press for that and will continue our diplomatic activity to ensure that those who need to come across can do so as say we have pre positioned border force operative in egypt with the logistical support to ensure that once british national do get across the rafah crossing into egypt we be able to collect they and bring they home safely however there be still dialogue to be have to make sure that can happen the spanish prime minister pedro sánchez have now call for humanitarian ceasefire alongside leo varadkar the irish taoiseach humza yousaf the scottish first minister the un secretary general and the eu high representative on foreign affairs will the prime minister urgently consider humanitarian ceasefire on the basis of not just aid but give our diplomatic effort the chance to free those hostage those hostage should be free unconditionally they should never have be take in the first place we will continue our diplomatic effort to ensure not just their wellbeing but their safe release that be why our conversation with the qataris among other be so important and evidence that that diplomacy be pay off have be demonstrate in the past few day however there be clearly considerable work to do give how many more hostage be be hold against their will these people be kidnap from israel they be innocent people they should not be there and they should be unconditionally release receive an email from constituent the day after the horrific terrorist attack in israel she be worried about the safety of her brother and his friend who be also both vauxhall constituent work with the foreign commonwealth and development office they thankfully make it to the border with jordan and be now back home however recognise that this be not the case for so many people so many people be still worried for their love one the killing of innocent people at music festival should shock we all and the kidnapping of innocent child should be condemn every night that put my six year old and eight year old to bed think of those innocent child kidnap without their parent we should all call this out israel have the right to defend itself and how israel do so matter the prime minister have touch on the humanitarian work that he have be do which welcome however have listen to member this afternoon and give the volume of email have receive from vauxhall constituent do he agree that temporary humanitarian corridor will help get that urgent aid through to gaza we be work on effort to get more humanitarian aid into gaza the crossing be now open aid be be pre position to el arish and neighbouring area and we be intensify our conversation on logistical support as well as further financial support be pleased that the hon lady constituent family be able to exit assume via the west bank just for member information we be also work on that side of the conflict to ensure we can support those british national who have register with the foreign office in their safe departure from the west bank should they so choose border force team and other be engage on that side of the conflict as well rise order apologise to the house but we be out of time for those watch would like to place on record the fact that significant number of member have not be able to be call but the fact that that be so do not mean they be not interested thank they all very much for their patience on point of order mr deputy speaker be it connect to the statement it be mr deputy speaker early this afternoon the hon member for hendon dr offord mention some of the horrific chanting this weekend he also mention that london underground tube driver have say the word jihad to ensure clarity at this really sensitive time our word matter should the hon member not come and correct what he have say because it have be state that the london underground staff member actually say free palestine not jihad the hon lady be well aware that all hon member be responsible for their own word in this place if the hon gentleman feel that he have something that he wish to amend he will do so but that be not matter for the chair storm babet flooding storm babet have affect number of community across the uk with the bad impact be see in scotland and the very sad loss of life in

derwent hold up well and protect the town its member of parliament my hon friend the member for derbyshire dales miss dines get in touch with to share picture to show how that defence be work and it have only just be complete the environment agency consider that its asset and response have largely be effective we should also consider more widely those area that have be protect due to flood defence that have be instal within the last decade we invest billion in flood defence between and which have well protect home all over england we be currently deploy more flood scheme between and with record billion of investment that include both hard defence and natural flood defence it include area such as hull for example where million scheme be open in which visit it be in the constituency of the shadow minister the hon member for kingston upon hull west and hessle emma hardy however we know of some area where the asset be overwhelmed not have be design for such rare extreme level of rainfall we will of course be review our response once the risk of flooding have pass that will consider flood warning trigger and local mobilisation of asset we should bear in mind that local resilience forum be the principal authority for decide and co ordinating response work off establish protocol and exist flood risk management plan some of this flooding be due to surface water flooding which be the primary responsibility of local authority however we work with local authority and third of our current funding be link to project for tackle surface water flooding across the country the government be also work to improve the local and national response to flooding include improve surface water flood forecasting we be invest million in that and through an environment agency met office and flood forecasting centre project we hope to come up with some valuable suggestion and action finally as local authority move to the recovery phase the department for levelling up housing and communities be already in contact with affected council to assess impact as these community look to recover thank the minister for advance sight of her statement our heart go out to all the family business and farmer affect by this tragedy but especially to those affect by the tragic loss of life thank the emergency service and environment agency worker for their tireless work around the clock to keep people safe more than property have be flood and hundred of people have be evacuate from their home life have be lose event such as storm babet be not unexpected however we know that flood happen every winter the minister statement that asset have not be design for such rare extreme level of rainfall show complacency we know that climate change be bring more frequent and more severe rainfall event and as know from the terrible flood in where property be flood in hull flooding have devastating impact on people life with their belonging lose and business destroy the country must be well prepared and we need to take our climate change goal seriously it be therefore incredibly worry that the national infrastructure commission state last week that there be no measurable long term national target to reduce flood risk and the current target do not factor in risk increase due to climate change to make matter bad one in six home in this country be at risk of flooding number that be only set to rise accord to the environment agency more than half of local planning authority survey rarely or never inspect new development to check flood risk planning condition have be carry out research commission by insurer find that almost one third of home build in the five most flood prone area be approve without flood assessment the government be asleep at the wheel why have they put home at risk of flooding by fail to ensure that local planning authority can carry out essential work as tell the minister last thursday an estimate home across the country be under threat from inadequately maintain flood defence in do the minister know where these inadequately maintain flood defence be do any of they fail over the weekend do she have any plan to find out be any of the overwhelmed asset that she mention these inadequately maintain flood asset the government have fail to get grip on the challenge face our country over flooding but these risk as keep say will only increase the independent review of flooding for london in note that the inability of organisation to share datum and co ordinate emergency preparedness action have undermine the response to flooding note that the minister refer to the defra and cabinet office meeting two day before the flood be due but that be not nearly enough it be time that we end the tory practice of wait for disaster to strike while the government want to pass off responsibility to other agency labour government would establish cobra style flood preparedness taskforce to protect community from the danger of flooding we will plan for the long term and co ordinate central government local authority and emergency service to minimise the damage of flooding every single winter importantly before the flooding take place that would ensure that community have the adequate drainage system and flood defence to protect themselves it be time to turn the page on the tories stick plaster politic and make the long term decision to protect community from the devastating impact of flooding that be how we give britain its future back first we be far from complacent quite the reverse the hon member suggest that we need to be well prepared that be what our whole flood budget be gear up to do that be why we double it to billion it be billion and it be now billion with all the associate flooding scheme that that be deliver both hard infrastructure and range of nature base solution which be high proportion of many of our scheme would have think that she for one would have recognise that give the million invest in hull her own constituency visit the scheme in invite she but do not think that she come to the launch and the people meet could not have express more wholeheartedly what it have do for hull and how it have protect property and business it be now attract business to hull that previously would not have come as it be too risky for flooding that be prime demonstration of what the government be do on asset maintenance we continue to invest in all our flood and coastal defence maintenance and have dedicate an extra million to maintenance in the current review period of of course check asset and keep they well maintain be critical part of the environment agency work virtually of major flood and coastal erosion risk management asset be in their target condition in addition when the warning begin week ago the environment agency and local authority go out to check asset clear culvert and drain and do all the small thing that make such big difference to whether there be or be not flood in our local area on planning application the environment agency give advice when there be any suggestion of flood risk and of all planning application comply with environment agency advice on flood risk it be important that there be strong safeguard in place where there be flood risk and there be but of course plan department have to decide whether to take note of the environment agency advice we be work hard with the department for levelling up housing and communities on this very issue see the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for redcar jacob young in his place alongside as it be critical to protect our island would have think the hon lady would have welcome the cabinet office meeting we already have exactly what she be ask for as we do have national flood response centre with the cabinet office the department for environment food and rural affairs and various government departments engage that be set up on wednesday and the met office information and the warning that have begin feed into its meeting that be why information be able to go out to people if we can do more and keep more people safe we will always do that that be why we have take note of the incident when it be safe to do so we will review particular thing to see whether we can improve people safety even more thank my hon friend for her statement the wide consequence of sudden torrential rainfall which be happen much more frequently be be clearly see in constituency and community such as mine be deal with the aftermath on friday there be two observation to draw first there be the need for long term planning with regard to provide more retention pond and understand the flow of watercourse in local area such as mine secondly short term culvert clearing and drain clearing operation clearly need to get well will she meet to discuss how we can well co ordinate local authority and the environment agency as well as the utility company which also have responsibility in this area thank my right hon and learn friend for those astute observation he be right about the more frequent incidence this be link to climate change there be no doubt about that we be focus exactly on the whole flow of water through our plan for water work at catchment basis which will be so important in future it be local authority role to keep culvert clean and all of that so will volunteer the minister from dluhc to meet he to discuss that important issue my thought and those of my colleague be with all those who have lose love one as result of the storm we be also think about those who have lose pet or have be displace from their home or business as result of water or wind damage during storm babet would like to thank the emergency responder and all those work in public service whether sse the scottish environment protection agency local council or the emergency service who step up to protect and prevent risk to people and to protect home and business wherever they could the river south esk in brechin reach metre above normal level the flood defence there be design to cover metre above normal level so they be overwhelm by the extreme weather the scottish government be commit to help community our first minister humza yousaf have be out in brechin to speak to those affect the uk government hold the purse string and it would be much easy for we to provide the right level of protection if they take financial action when will the uk government begin unlock the recovery and repair funding will the minister please commit to deliver the consequential of that funding to scotland as matter of urgency fully support the hon lady thank to all those emergency service work in scotland interestingly she name the coastguard involvement in her area to everyone involve we give our heartfelt thank and we give our sympathy to those who experience tragedy as point out this area be devolve so can not comment on lot of what she say she know it be devolve and will leave it at that thank my hon friend the minister for take time on saturday to discuss the dire situation develop across erewash more than home and many business have now be flood include home on station road and station street in ilkeston rutland grove regent street and westminster avenue in sandiacre and the nottingham road area of long eaton many resident yet again feel abandon by the authority especially the environment agency will my hon friend take action to ensure that my constituent get the support they need not only to deal with the clean up operation but to mitigate future flooding with more heavy rain forecast what be she do to ensure that homeowner be inform of flood risk at the early opportunity and not just by social medium which often exclude the old and vulnerable population across erewash thank my hon friend for all she do this weekend she be straight on the phone rightly represent her constituent believe that the water be now recede in erewash give my sympathy to those who have be flood lot of the flooding be surface water flooding so our new scheme to improve forecasting of surface water flooding will be real help to constituency such as hers dluhc ministers be work on what might be in place to help with the clear up and will speak to they later as will our department flood babet hit chesterfield very hard on friday with the river rother and the river hipper burst their bank tragically year old maureen gilbert of tapton terrace lose her life in her own home her death have hit both her family and her neighbour very hard on behalf of the whole house send our condolence to the family as many as home across brampton birdholme riverside and tapton terrace have be flood and countless business now face fight for their survival it be particularly hard to bear as the vast majority of those property be the same one that flood into despite the government implement scheme to protect the river rother why do resident on tapton terrace receive the phone call from the early warning system after their house have be flood what assessment have the minister make of the success of the early warning system the financial cost face flood victim and the council be huge can the minister explain when the department for levelling up housing and communities will confirm that resident qualify for financial support from the flood recovery framework and that the council will be cover for the huge additional cost via the bellwin scheme how quickly will the government be in position to announce that reiterate our condolence to the family of maureen nothing could be more tragic so huge sympathy go out to the family be in touch with the hon gentleman over the weekend about the situation in tapton terrace feed that straight into the environment agency which be work very closely with people up there to fully review what happen that will be part of the review that we instigate on the cost of clear up the bellwin scheme be trigger by dluhc the recovery department as say we will be meet to discuss whether that be appropriate when it would be appropriate and who might apply for it on friday rother valley be hit by flooding home in laughton common whiston brookhouse woodsetts and other place be flood with more flooding in the area of kiveton todwick treeton stone harthill and across the whole of rother valley what be clear when meet resident on friday and saturday be the concern that lack of drainage and culvert cleaning have cause the flooding as well as huge overdevelopment on the green belt especially in area such as whiston and laughton common what guidance can the minister give to council such as rotherham council to dissuade they from build over green space that be natural sink for water and to encourage they to clean the culvert and drain more frequently because it will lead to more and more flooding if they do not building and development have be consider work with dluhc in our holistic plan for water it be why we so urgently need sustainable urban drainage for example in our new development and to get that switch on it be be review and hopefully that will start to happen because it will make such difference in trap and capture water as do scheme such as grey water harvesting semi permeable driveway and so on urge plan department to consider they because they will make such difference in area such as my hon friend flooding devastate community across selby and ainsty resident be cause enormous anxiety and panic when event like storm babet occur will the minister outline what step she be take to work with the environment agency regionally in yorkshire to ensure that town like tadcaster be safe from flood in future can give the hon gentleman an absolute assurance that we be work very closely with the regional environment agencies in fact they come to the fore in incident like this and we be in constant communication with they they feed into plan for flood management and water resource it should be cohesive programme work together that be also why as mention early work in catchment be so important be grateful to the environment agency for call early update on the situation in derbyshire which have be particularly badly affect by the flooding we remain nervous about the impact of potential rainfall this evening but generally we be move to the recovery phase place on record my thank to all the community and authority who have be so brilliant this weekend however there be obviously great concern around the funding as we move into the recovery phase we need to make sure that derbyshire county council unlike in be give the proper funding it need to get thing back to normal when the minister meet dluhc later will she make sure that she emphasise the need for the funding to be put in place quickly hear what my hon friend say that be why we will be work closely with dluhc on what be possible to help local authority with the clear up derbyshire have be really badly hit but it have also have million of flood defence scheme well protect property great many property be protect that might otherwise have be flood we also have to bear that in mind the minister may not be aware of this but the bbc website have confirm in the last hour that there be now three confirm death in scotland as consequence of storm babet each one be tragedy and be sure that we all send sympathy and condolence to they and their family the loss of life could have be so much bad but for the willingness of other to put themselves in harm way in shetland the lerwick lifeboat be at sea for hour in atrocious condition to save the life of those on the danish trawler westbank and the coastguard helicopter airlift worker from the stena spey an offshore drilling rig do the minister agree that they deserve our gratitude and commendation and will she have word with her colleague in the department for transport who be currently propose that the response time for the shetland coastguard helicopter be increase from minute to of course send condolence for all three of those death any death be absolutely tragic and commend the lifeboat team who do such spectacular work in rescue the trawler and those who rescue the people on the oil rig this be tremendous story and accolade for they be not sure that be the one who can trigger the commendation but be sure that the right hon gentleman suggestion will be feed in and will certainly pass his other comment to the department for transport one of the victim be apparently from far forest which use to be in my constituency and obviously our thought and prayer be with the family at this moment this be go to happen again on the ground the environment agency worker do great job be it not time to merge the agency with natural england so that there be few manager and more people to protect we again send my condolence follow that very sad case in far forest be in the area on sunday so hear great deal about it from the local people my hon friend have make an interesting proposal think we should deal with the immediate issue first but on the ground those in the environment agency have do tremendous job in almost every case particularly those whom meet in bewdley must also give some praise to the community officer who meet so many worried and upset people on the street and also meet with some aggression they have do tremendous job in all the part of the country where they be send out over the last six year northwich in my constituency have be flood twice this time round have learn from the section report the environment agency cheshire west and chester council the canal river trust the emergency service and other local council do sterling job to prevent it from happen again my concern for the future however relate to the huge cut in the trust amount to million issue this plea to the minister will she look at that and think again be pleased to hear that all those organisation do such grand job locally we understand the huge benefit bring by the canal river trust and the great work that it do but that million figure be something of bone of contention the trust have adjust the figure for inflation and the government do not normally do that with their fund thank the secretary of state for her visit to retford and ordsall today to meet some of the hundred of people who be evacuate such as those in darrel road and to see the devastation at first hand for many of those resident it be not the first time that this have happen also thank the minister for her reassurance that we will provide as much support as possible and will invest in the appropriate flood defence to make sure that we can mitigate the impact do she agree however that we need to remind council of their responsibility to communicate information effectively to our constituent in my case one of the emergency respite centre be close with only minute notice and one of the emergency phone line be down for nearly two day can we also please ask council to stop build on floodplain know that the secretary of state visit my hon friend constituency today and will have see for herself exactly what local people be face know that my hon friend have rightly be great champion for they and he make good point about the role of local authority in the local flood forum it be important that everybody play their part in this not just the emergency service who come in if there be problem it be about the messaging early on and that be why the environment agency have comprehensive system of warning that people can sign up to some million people be sign up to its flood warning scheme and would urge people to ensure that they know how to join it also urge local authority to play the role that they really should be play and will be talk to the department for levelling up housing and communities to stress that far follow the storm at the weekend several area in my constituency be affect there be still active flood alert across cheshire so many area be not out of the wood yet on saturday morning visit number of my constituent live in close proximity to finchett gutter who express serious concern over the timing of the flood alert receive over the weekend some of they be already stand knee deep in water by the time the alert come through join members across the house in ask the minister again what discussion have be have to ensure that as the rainfall continue alert be send out in timely fashion to give resident plenty of warning of course it be critical that warning go out appropriately at the right time and that be why this incident start to be flag the previous weekend and why the national flood response centre be set up there be comprehensive environment agency flood warning service and advise people to sign up to it as well as check whether they be in an area that might be at risk of flooding one of the issue be awareness the ea run lot of comms programme on this but if there be more that should be do will look at that in the review when storm arwen hit cumbria two year ago many of our village and other community lose electrical power for several day due to damage power cable know that that have happen to many community over the last few day what progress have the government make since to make britain power infrastructure more resilient for example by create national bank of mobile generator to ensure that community be not leave cold dark and vulnerable for day on end have the people hit by storm babet benefit from lesson learn from storm arwen or be we no far forward would like to assure the hon gentleman that defra have be work closely with the department for energy security and net zero which have strategy for exactly this issue because it be critical that power outage be consider when emergency such as this take place effective action be take over the rolls royce plant in the derbyshire area that be very effective alignment with the energy department just as an aside we work closely with the water industry on preparedness should there be electricity outage some of which might be link to flooding in fact there be another incident near derby and it have clear management plan my heart go out to all the community affect and particularly to those who lose their life the image on the news of the devastation of the flood will also have an impact on community who have be flood previously and have escape many people in prestolee on the river irwell in my constituency will be among those watch with great anxiety have raise this issue several time in the chamber and with the minister can she assure that every house in every community that have face repeat flooding this week and in previous year include prestolee will get the funding they need to be able to protect their life livelihood and property the hon lady and have meet and discuss her issue number of time will just flag that we launch the frequently flood fund of million which allocate fund to project the area that put forward viable project for the funding be find it very effective and another round will open shortly insurance be also really important for house where there be possibility of flooding and flood re work intensively on that the process have be tweak to ensure that as many house as possible can get into it and huge number of property have be help those that have difficulty can go to the inventory that have just be set up and people who have slightly more difficult case have be help through that the association of british insurers have work closely to ensure that all people be be cater for there be also an extra build back well to build one property back well many of my constituent in dundee and angus be hit very hard by the storm and wish to add my thank to all the emergency service and other particularly at dundee city council and angus council who do so much to help it be absolutely tragic to see car submerge home flood business close bridge wash away and of course life lose give that we be see more and more frequent extreme weather event and give that the minister recognise climate change in her statement do she not now regret the prime minister recent statement roll back many of the measure necessary to tackle climate change quickly contrary to what the right hon gentleman propose we take this matter extremely seriously that be why we have double the flooding budget to billion as we be aware of these extreme weather incident it be also why we have open range of other fund such as the million flood and coastal resilience innovation programme to look at how we can accelerate flood protection in area where it will be tricky as sea level rise and so on another million project in the thames estuary the humber estuary the severn estuary and yorkshire be look at pathway to deal with exactly these thing my heart go out to everyone affect by flooding particularly in barnsley darfield wombwell worsbrough lundwood and darton the response to flooding be obviously fragment by its nature because there be so many agency involve from the emergency service to the local authority the environment agency the water company and national government mention in particular worsbrough bridge athletic football club which have suffer flood five year in row because it be not home or business it often struggle to get support what advice and more importantly action can the government give to community group such as worsbrough bridge athletic football club that be affect by persistent flooding individual business can seek insurance there be insurance out there which urge worsbrough bridge athletic football club to seek there be many other measure include our natural flood management scheme which be look at much wide way of encourage flood protection we have just launch new million fund on that and there be also our frequently flood allowance there be fund out there but the hon lady local authority could also do lot to come up with the correct plan for its area thank the minister for her statement but she make significant omission in relation to the impact on the railway network which have implication for funding and the response in scotland because the network be not devolve follow august fatal derailment at carmont near stonehaven in which three people lose their life network rail give commitment to the national union of rail maritime and transport workers that it would put in place additional resource to address the drainage maintenance failure that be responsible but the rmt gordon martin have claim that network rail modernise maintenance project have less to do with improvement and everything to do with cut as the minister be responsible for flooding and its impact will she raise this with her counterpart in the department for transport to ensure that network rail failing do not again lead to death and injury as they do in august will certainly pass on those comment to the department for transport thank the minister very much for her statement and for her enthusiasm when it come to improve and do well which think we all welcome do she accept that this storm and other like it have adversely affect coastal erosion around the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland especially in area such as the ards peninsula in my strangford constituency have she have any discussion with the cabinet about create dedicated fund to build up defence in coastal community against the batter wind and wave that be literally beat away our coastline and impairing road and rail safety the hon gentleman mention the particular challenge that coastal area face we have launch million flood and coastal innovation programme to look at those issue in particular urge he to suggest that his own cabinet look at some similar project we be happy to share the detail my sympathy be with all those affect by these terrible flood thousand of resident of reading caversham and woodley in my constituency live in area that could be affect by catastrophic flooding yet plan to build flood defence next to the river thames in reading have be delay will the minister write to urgently with an update on this important issue to reassure local resident and business as the hon gentleman will know the water resource management plan be under discussion right now protection reservoir and water supply will all be discuss within those plan can not comment on what will be in the plan yet but be sure that he have feed into they urge he to continue to do so because keep people safe along this great river be of the utmost importance vast area of my constituency be once again under water despite storm babet not be the most serious that we have experience in recent time although my resident be largely dry this time around they be often cut off for week when floodwater rise and many of they be old and vulnerable what conversation have the minister have with her colleague in dluhc about protect people who be cut off from basic service for such long period when floodwater rise have have great many discussion with dluhc about these issue we also work closely with the environment agency as the hon lady will know the local resilience forum will be factor in area at potential risk of be cut off so that they have emergency system in place have be right up the river into the hon lady constituency to look at these issue know how closely the environment agency be work on those plan and how mindful it be of get the right warning system in place for any such area that be why our nature base solution funding our frequently flood allowance and our billion fund be so important point of order on point of order mr deputy speaker thank you for this opportunity to raise point of order about serious incident affect my hon friend the member for bedford mohammad yasin on select committee visit to canada last week on check in for their flight at heathrow all committee member get through except my hon friend who be delay for question for considerable period he be tell that this be because his name be mohammad he be ask whether he be carry knife or other offensive weapon he be also ask where he be bear the questioning be undertake by official from air canada and we believe the canadian government despite my hon friend have already be give visa to enter canada after prove that he be an mp with help from our committee clerk he be eventually allow through at montreal airport the same issue be raise by canadian immigration at toronto airport on the way back my hon friend be again challenge he get on his flight with assistance from our consul general who be very helpful my hon friend have receive apology from the parliamentary secretary to the canadian minister for immigration and from air canada however give the racist and islamophobic nature of these challenge believe that as well as write to the canadian high commissioner which will do it be important to put these concern on the parliamentary record it be completely unacceptable for member of this house to be treat in this way because he be an mp my hon friend be allow on his flight if however one of our constituent have be so challenge they might have be refuse we raise the issue with our high commissioner in ottawa who be very supportive she be amazed at what have happen give the multicultural nature of canada as an open and welcome country she have raise the matter with the canadian government and appreciate that be raise it in parliament to try to ensure that no one be treat in this way in future look forward to any help that you can give in this matter mr deputy speaker thank the hon member for his point of order and for give advance notice of it be sure that the whole house share his dismay at the treatment of the hon member for bedford mohammad yasin it be wholly unacceptable under any circumstance but it be particularly concern when it occur as it do in the course of official travel on parliamentary business the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts be absolutely right to put his concern on the record be sure that ministers on the treasury bench will also have note his comment on point of order mr deputy speaker today after have ask for statement from the paymaster general on the recently announce delay to the infected blood inquiry final report short word statement have be lay by the government that number be in stark contrast to the people who be estimate to have die since the inquiry start with one person die every four day on average the short statement fail to deal with the final recommendation make already by sir brian langstaff for make interim payment for which there be now an even strong case because of the delay to his final report there be no detail on progress to establish compensation scheme as have also already be recommend by sir brian langstaff and no explanation of why contaminate blood victim be be treat differently from victim of the horizon scandal who be already go to receive in compensation before that final report be produce what more can do mr deputy speaker to get the government to deal with this matter in timely way and to ensure that as much information as possible be disclose and that these people be show some compassion appreciate the right hon lady concern but she in turn will understand that that be not matter for the chair it be matter for the government however as before be sure

tenant have the right that they deserve while also recognise the importance of the private rental sector to our economy and the fact that the overwhelming number of private landlord provide an excellent service it be also important that we provide they with the right to redress require when deal with antisocial tenant tenant in arrear or other factor that may mean that they need to have recourse to secure vacant possession of property the private rental sector be vital for reason of labour mobility and personal convenience and overall because of the different way that we respond to the labour market and other pressure at different point in all our life we need healthy private rent sector would like to place on the record my thank to ben beadle and the national residential landlords association for the work they have consistently do to ensure that the voice of landlord be hear and to ensure as ben beadle have make clear that landlord the overwhelming majority of whom provide good service can be certain because of our property portal the ombudsman and the other change in the bill that the small minority of poor landlord who victimise tenant can be drive out of the system and the good name of those in the private rent sector uphold rise be very happy to give way to the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas then to the hon member for strangford jim shannon then to the hon member for chesterfield mr perkins and then to the hon member for enfield north feryal clark there be plenty to welcome in this bill but it should have be an opportunity to increase minimum energy efficiency standard when the secretary of state for energy security and net zero last week try to defend the scrapping of energy efficiency standard for the prs she essentially say on the floor of the house that it be because they could cost property owner up to the right hon gentleman will know that the regulation include cap so the cost can not possibly be indeed accord to the government own assessment the average cost of upgrade home to an energy performance certificate rating of would be less than will he please correct the record apologise on behalf of his colleague who have mislead the house and put it on the record that it could not possibly cost his own assessment suggest that it cost less than be grateful to the hon lady no one could doubt her sincerity or her commitment to make sure that we improve the condition of home and that we deal with energy efficiency the first thing to say be that the cost will be determine in the market the amount that an individual might have to pay can be cap by legislation but the cost be function of the market the second thing that it be important to stress be that the decent home standard and indeed the work we be do on retrofit overall will improve and have improve energy efficiency but we need to balance the improvement of energy efficiency against the cost that individual landlord and tenant face in cost of living time that be challenging rise rise be happy to give way to the hon member for strangford the minister be right to say that the encouragement of private landlord be important to ensure that rental property be available but it be also incredibly important that unscrupulous landlord be not facilitate in avoid their obligation in relation to the obligation citizens advice have recently announce some figure which show that of evicted tenant have be tell that their landlord want to sell this be common reason for end tenancy with respect nothing in this legislation suggest that landlord must give evidence that they have follow through on their intention to sell will the minister rectify that of course landlord and any property owner must have the right to sell their home if they need or wish to do so nothing should interfere with that none the less it be the case that there may be circumstance in which there will be some landlord who use an attempt to sell or claim to sell as feint in order to evict tenant in committee we will explain how we will ensure that in those circumstance the situation be effectively deal with thank the secretary of state for give way this weekend be out meet flood victim in chesterfield the flood damage of one of they be up to foot high in their front room they be tell by the landlord who be busy as arrive hoover the carpet which have sewage and river effluent all over it that they must accept that the landlord would attempt to clean the carpet rather than renter expect new one and that if they would not tolerate that she would end their tenancy and throw they out do that not demonstrate how the balance of power between landlord and renter be totally skewed be there not all the more need for the strong possible legislation to ensure that we do take action against those rogue landlord agree with the hon gentleman up to point but would not characterise it in quite that way on the basis of everything that he have say that be completely the wrong response from the landlord concern but would stress that there be only minority of bad landlord and also that the law clearly delineate and have do so for some time the responsibility for repair between the tenant and the landlord it be important that we always strike balance between the need of landlord to ensure that their business be effective and the protection that tenant enjoy if the hon gentleman write to about that specific case will see what can do to help be grateful to the secretary of state for give way my constituent esther and fred lose their son two week ago in the most horrific of circumstance the very week that they lose their son they be serve section notice despite the landlord know their circumstance what message do it send to renter like esther and fred that the government be yet again delay the abolition of section eviction be deeply sorry to hear about the personal tragedy that the hon lady constituent have suffer please do pass on my sympathy and condolence would say though that this bill lead to the abolition of section and it do so in way that believe be right and proportionate will explain why think it be necessary but before do so must give way to the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn thank the secretary of state for give way note he say that nationally around of the population live in the private rent sector in constituency such as mine the figure be to and many people feel very insecure in their life for those on universal credit and housing benefit the problem be that the local housing allowance do not meet their rent need therefore they be actually subsidise landlord through their benefit and live in desperate poverty as result of it in turn this force people in mainly ex council property to leave the borough so we end up with sort of social cleansing of our inner city all over the country do the secretary of state understand that we need rent control so that those people who can not afford to remain in their own home get some comfort and be allow to continue be valuable part of our local community although the right hon gentleman and have have many disagreement there be no one who doubt that he be very assiduous constituency member and he be right that the pressure face by number of people in the private rented sector be significant the principal reason for those rental pressure be inflation we can debate the cause of inflation but this government be determined to do everything possible to halve it and believe the step that we be take have show progress so far rise please forgive be just respond to the right hon gentleman it be the case that our effective system of tribunal ensure that excessive rent that be way out of kilter with the market can be deal with however one of the challenge of rent control of the kind that believe he be advocate and that have be advocate by other on the labour front bench be that they be prove to reduce supply overall and reduction of supply on the scale that an intervention of the kind that he put forward would only increase rent and reduce the capacity of people to be able to live in the private rent sector do my right hon friend not agree that the bill would do exactly what he have just be say be the problem with rent control which be to drive private landlord out of the market be that not entirely contrary to the government main aim right now which be to bring down inflation private rent be the key cause of core inflation and this be disastrous bill for every renter in the country who want to see well supply housing market be very fond of my hon friend but that be just not true we have see an increase in the number of home in the private rent sector recently not reduction interruption as we say in scotland fact be chiel that winna ding there be no evidence at all that the abolition of section and at the same time the enhancement of section will lead to any reduction in the number of home in the private rent sector however let say to he and to the whole house that what we need be not so much an arbitrage between the private rent sector and the number of home available for private ownership or indeed the social rent sector but more home overall it be that which be at the root of our challenge and we will solve it with our long term plan for housing which be outline in july of this year rise no have be generous so far every intervention only take time from those who wish to contribute to the debate let develop my argument and then will give way to some other colleague but perhaps not all just wish to stress what the abolition of section involve get rid of section mean that weapon use by unscrupulous landlord can no long be in their hand essentially section no fault eviction be use by that small minority of bad landlord to intimidate tenant it be the case that significant number of tenant have concern about the quality of their home or indeed about excessive rent rise but section have be use to silence those who have complain about the quality of their property to intimidate they into accept excessive rent rise and in certain circumstance it have be prosecute anyway lead to significant number of in the past year find themselves render homeless and therefore the taxpayer and local authority have to pay for their accommodation it be in nobody interest to allow unscrupulous landlord to continue to behave in this way to allow vulnerable people to be render voiceless in this way and to force the taxpayer to pick up the bill the idea that abolish section be somehow un conservative be to absolutely nonsensical conservative exist to protect the vulnerable in society to make sure that market work and to save the taxpayer money have to say to any hon member who think that such policy be un conservative that they should consider the conservative record the artisan dwelling act the law of property act the leasehold property repairs act the landlord and tenant act the landlord and tenant act when margaret thatcher be prime minister the housing and planning act and the tenant fees act be all conservative measure introduce by conservative prime ministers in order to ensure that the private rented sector could work well and critically they all make provision for the right of tenant rise be more than happy to give way order think that be right in say that the hon lady have only just enter the chamber she should wait for wee while before she rise to intervene rise will give way to colleague in moment the key thing to consider when think about how those in the private rent sector live be that the overwhelming majority of landlord do great job but we know that because of section of tenant in that sector who wish to complain about condition choose not to do so and of those who do be subsequently evict under section as mention people be assess as homeless as direct result be absolutely committed as be the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss when she be prime minister as be the former member for uxbridge and south ruislip when he be prime minister and as all conservative members be when we put it in our manifesto to get rid of section but it be important to recognise that in so do we need to strengthen the provision that landlord have in order to deal with those tenant who for whatever reason need to be evict from their property we be outline an extensive range of provision under section we be move to ensure that antisocial behaviour be deal with more effectively by make it mandatory ground for remove tenant we be lower the threshold so that it be easy to establish antisocial behaviour we be deal more effectively with rent arrear and the way in which some unscrupulous tenant have hitherto manipulate the system on rent arrear we be make it clear that anyone who wish to occupy their property because they need to sell it repair it or have family member within it or for any other reason can do so it be about strengthen both protection for tenant and power for landlord in the case where they need it rise be now more than happy to give way to range of colleague order will allow the right hon gentleman to do that in just moment but first let set the record straight the clerks have inform that the hon member for twickenham munira wilson be in the chamber from the start apologise would not wish that to influence the decision of the secretary of state on who he give way to accept entirely the force of what the secretary of state have say but clearly under section many landlord will for perfectly legitimate reason to get rid of tenant for antisocial behaviour or whatever have recourse to section simply because of the convenience and ease particularly in the face of tenant who make particular difficulty that be why the provision that he be make in respect of the court be able to deal with such thing effectively and efficiently be vital as part of the reform that he be bring forward actually agree with my right hon friend it be vital that we ensure that the court system be reform and that we have end to end digitisation we have see section abuse but if determined tenant wish for whatever reason to ignore section that end up in the court anyway my constituent jan childs rent property in much wenlock to an individual she get into dispute with he have now scarper owe my constituent and nobody seem to be interested in help she to retrieve the money neither the police nor the local authority how will this bill help my constituent jan childs to retrieve she it be not so much this bill it be more the step that we be take in order to improve the justice system that will help but would be grateful if my hon friend would write to about that particular situation it be always the case no matter how well frame any piece of legislation might be that if we be deal with unscrupulous character who seek to evade justice we have to rely on the agency of the criminal justice system to pursue they on point of order mr deputy speaker apologise should have refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests when intervene my right hon friend be nearly always right and always honourable too put on the record my entry in the register of members financial interests some month ago raise with the hon member for kensington felicity buchan who be present my concern about the illegal eviction law which be over year old complex and difficult to understand unless we reform illegal eviction law alongside section worry that bad landlord will take matter into their own hand have the department take into account the concern that raise with government official about reform illegal eviction law at the same time know that my colleague the housing and planning minister have meet the hon lady and we will respond in further detail about the step that we propose to take give that the secretary of state be get quite few pot shot from behind he let help he out by say that welcome the ban on section no fault eviction it be sadly very overdue and hope that he will not delay in implement it because as london mp have have countless people in my surgery and contact via email who have be evict under section most egregious case involve father of two young child both of whom be gravely ill he have to tackle the mould in his home himself because the landlord be not deal with it then the landlord evict he for make the repair will the secretary of state commit to implement the reform without delay absolutely the soon the bill be on the statute book the soon we can proceed alongside that we of course need to ensure that the justice system as my right hon friend the member for new forest west sir desmond swayne make clear be in position to implement it effectively that be why the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer be present he and and the minister for housing and planning be work to do just that on the enhance ground for antisocial behaviour have one constituent who have be evict because their baby be cry too much and another who have be evict because her husband be beat she too loudly do the secretary of state not recognise that the ground need to be discretionary one on which the court can deliberate not mandatory one otherwise it will be handle for abuser to use very much take the hon gentleman point do not believe that either of those two case would count as antisocial behaviour under our proposal but we need to ensure that we be clear about what constitute antisocial behaviour liable to lead to eviction and what be as in those case either preposterous claim or an example of domestic abuse that the police should be investigate too welcome the intention to scrap no fault eviction year ago ask about the matter at prime minister question say it go to be winter it cold as be long time ago welcome the proposal although some detail be need on the burden of proof under thatcher from my recollection the conservatives be the party of the family so why have the blanket ban on unscrupulous landlord say no child vanish as have the no people on benefit stipulation know from my weekly surgery landlord who say no dss be the big barrier to unlock this part of the market because pensioner and other be exclude have the conservatives do away with thatcher or be their tail be wag by all the people apparently one in five tory mps be landlord make declaration of interest first we will be clear that landlord can not have blanket ban of the kind that the hon lady rightly draw to the house attention secondly colleague will declare interest but landlord be good thing we need landlord to provide home it be nothing to be ashamed of to be in the business of provide safe warm and decent home for someone and there be nothing wrong with people who have save and work hard investing in property you do not need to be margaret thatcher to believe that that be right the levelling up housing and communities committee raise the need for an effective and efficient court system to deal with such matter eviction will now have to go to court because they will not be automatic under section also many more tenant may go to court over landlord refuse to do repair because they will no long fear retaliatory eviction official in the department have suggest that the delay in implement the bill come about because of the need to reform the court and that that be down to the select committee as be sure the secretary of state be aware the select committee actually recommend specialist housing court we do that several year ago if the secretary of state have agree to that at the time there would no long be any need for delay the court would be up and run and be effective and efficient in deal with case in the future be grateful to the chair of the select committee but the view of the ministry of justice his majesty courts and tribunals service and other involve in the court system be that the creation of specialist housing court would divert resource from the effort to make the exist system work well but good people can disagree on that point rise as what be know as an accidental landlord who conveniently own and rent out property in tamworth speak as landlord welcome the bill particularly the property portal which will allow council to focus their resource well on landlord who provide poor quality accommodation and give council the opportunity to drive they out of business my hon friend be absolutely right two of the less conspicuous but important part of the bill be the creation of the property portal and the role of the private rent sector ombudsman if they work effectively both should obviate the need for the court process that the chair of the select committee and my right hon friend the member for new forest west sir desmond swayne have mention the property portal should ensure that we can identify property in the private rent sector whose landlord have not register and we can focus our enforcement action on they welcome well protection for renter in my constituency swathe of constituent have be evict so that landlord can flip their property to become short term holiday let nationally there may have be growth in landlord number but the country land and business association and the english housing survey both report that rural seat have see demise in landlord number of about in my constituency we have lose of our long term landlord since the end of the pandemic what step will be take to reverse the trend so that long term landlord come back into constituency such as mine what would like to see in my hon friend constituency and so many other be an increase in housing overall house for social rent for private rent and above all for people to own as the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron point out there be particular challenge in the very attractive part of the country such as those my hon friend represent that attract tourism there have be phenomenon whereby house that would have be available for rent to the local community have be airbnb ise although not just through that company they have be turn into short term let and effectively be operate as shadow or shadow hotel there be nothing wrong there be everything right with make sure that we utilise property as efficiently as possible but that have create percussive and deleterious consequence in some area that be why we be consult on both use the planning system and also with our colleague in the department for culture media and sport form of registration to ensure that the situation work ultimately however the challenge be increase supply overall the secretary of state have just mention the private rental ombudsman post that welcome be he consider the case for give that job to the exist housing ombudsman who support the social housing sector at the moment yes we be there be case for both separate organisation and for have the issue fall to the exist ombudsman who have to say have be do very effective job must draw my remark to close shortly so that all colleague who wish to contribute can but the right hon gentleman intervention provide an opportunity to suggest that the condition of housing in this country particularly housing build in the and be profound cause for concern many of those home be reach the end of their natural life as result of how they be build we be see not just build safety issue but child in particular living in home that be not decent the tragedy of awaab ishak death remind we that damp mould and other poor housing condition can have deleterious effect not just on life chance but on life themselves that be why the social housing regulation act the action of the housing ombudsman and the action that my department have take have be focus on ensure that register provider and social landlord live up to their responsibility what we seek to do in the bill be ensure that the small minority of private sector landlord who also need to up their game do so we be not target any one sector we be not target register provider of social housing while leave the private rent sector off the hook nor be we direct particular attention to the private rent sector and let register social landlord off the hook what we be do be ensure that citizen who deserve warm decent safe home get one that be what the establishment of the decent home standard through this legislation will do the bill would have be good opportunity to bring forward provision ensure that home be keep at decent standard will the secretary of state assure the house that he will bring forward measure before the next election that will address decent home standard for the private rent sector at the very beginning of my introduction to the bill stress my gratitude to all those who have work to shape the measure and make recommendation on how we could improve it be sure that in committee we will hear representation from different member and different organisation about how we can improve the bill far be open minded about that my aim be to ensure that we get new deal and fair deal for both landlord and tenant have listen to representation from the national residential landlords association and other about make sure that the overwhelming majority of landlord who do great job be able to deal with small minority of tenant who behave badly have also listen to representation from individual tenant and those campaign for they who want we to move ahead with the abolition of section and the establishment of the portal the establishment of the portal and the existence of the ombudsman will believe ensure that landlord be on firm ground and no long undercut by rogue and that tenant get well deal it be because the bill provide both landlord and tenant with strong protection for the future that commend it to the house it be pleasure to open this debate on behalf of the opposition start by say that we on these benches will not oppose the bill today that may be more than can be say for some on the benches behind the secretary of state after nearly five year of foot drag it appear that they need to be appease with yet more delay we disagree renter be at the sharp edge of the current housing crisis and urgently need the protection and support in the bill protection that unfortunately be just too late for many renter struggle right now in this cost of living crisis but as they say well late than never welcome the bill in fact welcome much of what the secretary of state say in his opening remark we have be call for such measure for some year we will be pleased to finally see the abolition of section whenever that actually come labour also welcome the simplification of tenancy which will give renter more flexibility and right it be right that periodic tenancy should become the norm mean that renter can give two month notice and get out of tenancy at any point we far welcome the creation of new ombudsman that have the potential to be an essential part of the redress system for too long renter have lack basic power and control over one of the fundamental of life their home tenant have struggle to challenge unfair treatment without undergo lengthy and expensive court proceeding if this ombudsman be give the proper tooth and resource they will have an important role to play in level the play field think the secretary of state agree we be pleased that the tory rebrand of labour propose landlord register have make it into the bill too the register be good for landlord and tenant finally it be good to see the government build in provision to make it easy for renter to have pet as be sure the prime minister agree pet be an important part of the family just as long as we remember not to let they off the lead illegally after four and half year of foot dragging there can be no more dither and delay in end no fault eviction the secretary of state make strong point in his opening remark but be afraid that he do not see the face behind he can see why he have spend year argue with the landlord on his back benches tenant across the country have be wrongfully evict kick out of their home and make homeless in fact since his government first announce the end of no fault eviction back in april total of household have be kick out on to the street that be more than family put at risk of homelessness since this government first propose to protect they every single day another person suffer the same fate accord to shelter private renter over the age of be serve section eviction notice every minute it have take the government four and half year to reach the second reading of the bill the secretary of state be at pain to stress that the majority of landlord be good one it be almost like say that there have be delay to murder legislation because most people do not kill people the reality be that we need legislation because there be some bad landlord and the imbalance between renter and landlord be huge do my right hon friend agree that although it be welcome that we have finally get to second reading many people have be let down by how long it have take it be now the responsibility of we all to get the legislation move as quickly as we can agree hope can bring the house together when say that it be right that we get move on this issue the secretary of state have make it clear that the government will move on it but be concerned about potential delay will come to those point in more detail there may well be consensus in the house hope there be we will see how it go later on major issue that come to my attention and that of many other be mould condensation and damp in house about which tenant tell regularly do the right hon lady feel that the bill can satisfactorily address that to ensure the health and safety of tenant and their family we need legislation for decent home alongside these provision hope that we can get into that and how we can protect people in committee as the secretary of state acknowledge at the moment many family face situation of inadequate housing which go beyond the scope of the bill think we all agree that that need to be address as soon as possible on decent home standard would the right hon lady support the integration of awaab law into the bill we be talk about delay but my concern be that if those provision do not make it into the bill right now our constituent include some of mine in brighton will still be live in absolutely atrocious accommodation with water stream down their wall mould and kid get ill if we can address that in the bill we should push for it but we should also push to ensure that whether in social housing or private rental people should have confidence that their home be safe home should be safe place but at the moment that be not the case for too many huge swathe of renter have be leave pay heavy price for the government inaction on section this be real for people such as the brady family who live in wiltshire and have experience two no fault eviction in the past two year mr brady be gardener and mrs brady work full time after be force out of their home where they have live for year they have resort to live in their van the family be able to bid on council house when they become available but so far everything have be at least an hour away from where they live mr brady say there be housing crisis and there be reason behind it you can use whatever excuse you want but it be political decision it be political decision not to build enough house it be political decision to sell off the social housing stock those be not my word but the word of man who would still have roof over his head if the government have not drag their foot feel that more delay be inevitable conservative members threaten in the newspaper this weekend to choose their self interest over the national interest by oppose or delay the bill they do not want to see these change enact then on friday evening the department sneak out the suggestion that section change be dependent on court improvement which could take year to complete today we discover not from an announcement to the press to parliament or to the public but from leak that that be indeed the core part of grubby private deal that the secretary of state have strike behind close door with his own back benchers so the government who break our justice system be now use their own failure as an excuse to break their own promise just how long will it take can the secretary of state promise that the government will meet the pledge they make at the last general election which he mention before the next general election renter simply can not afford any more excuse or delay he must provide clarity on that interruption know that he be confident secretary of state he say so from sedentary position and have confidence in his ability but people who be face section notice can not afford any more dither and delay he will get support from those on the labour benches in enact this legislation to protect family who need protection we think that the bill be good starting point we fear that number of loophole have be leave in it however one such loophole be the commencement clause which leave ministers the power to decide when or perhaps whether to actually bring an end to section but that be not the only loophole hope that the minister will engage with we constructively in committee to close all those loophole and strengthen the bill in range of area for example the new ground for and protection from eviction be welcome step but the detail on those ground remain vague on eviction there remain loophole by which renter be protect only for the first six month of their tenancy if their landlord decide to sell the property or move back in that time limit need to be increase as part of the bill to give renter proper protection on section it be not just question of when the law be implement but of how every household threaten with homelessness by section notice have the right to assistance from their local council to prevent they from become homeless but the bill remove that right to immediate help that loophole could lead to huge spike in homelessness and must be close my right hon friend be make an excellent speech be grateful to she for highlight that point have come across such case and it be an absolutely appalling situation often young family be thrust out of their home with very little notice and local authority struggle to cope at the moment many such case that have come across involve people be move to out of the area thank my hon friend for highlight that concern to be fair to the secretary of state he acknowledge the challenge in his remark not just the housing challenge but all the challenge face by family people be scared and live insecure live because of the devastation and ripple effect of the challenge they face my right hon friend be right to highlight the human cost of those eviction but there be also financial cost to council bristol city council pay exorbitant amount to put people into emergency and temporary accommodation which it should not have to do so do she agree that on top of help people by ensure that they do not have to go through the pain of eviction the government have financial interest in resolve the issue absolutely agree also think that as the secretary of state mention most private landlord want to do the right thing and be good part of our housing mix they should therefore welcome the fact that we be do our good to ensure that their good name be uphold and that they be not stain by the tiny minority who do not do the right thing who be the reason why these protection be so overdue we be also concerned that the change to antisocial behaviour ground be as they stand ambiguous and open to abuse mental health need and domestic abuse be sometimes report as antisocial behaviour so that definition must be make more pragmatic and focus on genuine antisocial behaviour the secretary of state make reference to this issue and hear what he say look forward to work with he in committee to address it because it be important the bill be also silent on the issue of economic eviction while it strengthen the law to ensure landlord can only increase rent once year which be welcome the mechanism for tenant to contest excessive rent hike be not strong enough give people little real protection against so call economic eviction be there not particular problem with the evidence that the rent tribunal will look at the proposal be that they will look at the average market rent but the local housing allowance be set at only of the local average mean that rent could increase above the lha and no one would be able to complain about it it be absolutely right that we get into these challenge because do not think people feel that the current situation provide redress for the challenge they face hope that in committee the secretary of state will listen to point make by member across the house to ensure that people get the redress and support that they need and that we strengthen tenant right in this area the bill do not really deal with the issue of affordability at all one of the big issue be the freezing of the local housing allowance some of property in the private rented sector be not affordable with the amount of lha that be payable the select committee recommend that we go back to the figure as be previously the case so could we push for that to happen currently many people simply can not afford anything at all in the private rent sector we have to get into that issue but we also have to deal with the root cause which be that we do not have enough adequate social housing in this country we do not have enough housing and that be because of year of the tories failure to build the housing that we need and to challenge member on their back benches the prime minister have fail to challenge those on his back benches who have delay house building in this country when we need it so desperately the secretary of state mention the hon member for walsall north eddie hughes and the white paper but be disappointed that many of the proposal in the government white paper have since be drop the secretary of state say that he be open minded and be glad about that because the bill be silent on proposal to make blanket ban on rent to family with child or those in receipt of benefit illegal that sort of unacceptable practice must be stamp out and hope he will work with we to make sure the bill do so in the white paper the government also promise to introduce the decent home standard to give renter safe well value home and remove the blight of poor quality home in local community that standard be miss from the bill but do hear what the secretary of state say in his opening remark gently say to he that we can not miss an opportunity to give private renter the protection the long term security and well right and condition that they deserve to ensure that tenant have that safety do the right hon lady agree that we need new regulator for all private rental with the power to subject landlord to regular inspection the bill talk about the ombudsman we need to make sure that landlord understand their obligation and where they do not we need to ensure that there be redress as mention early that ombudsman must have real tooth and hope the secretary of state understand that while respect the landlord who be in the chamber and those who be listen to this debate know many of they do good job and be try their good we have to have minimum standard we can not have circumstance as we have see in greater manchester where child be live in very poor condition it be really important that we have regulation and where people be in accommodation that fall below those standard we have redress after four year the clock be tick there can be no more delay but the government track record do not instil much confidence on the tories watch mortgage bill and rent be soar few people be able to buy their own home and over million people be stick on social housing waiting list those problem be only go to get bad because the prime minister could not stand up to his back benchers on house building target now it appear that once again he be cave in to they rather than keep his promise to the british people this bill be an important step forward support renter at the sharp edge of the cost of living crisis so labour will work constructively throughout its passage we will not be the cause of delay hope the secretary of state can say the same about his back benchers if they can not act in the national interest and support renter reform bill worthy of its name let make clear that our offer be to do so instead because over the course of our proceeding today renter will have be put at risk of homelessness because they be issue with section notice and will have get visit from the bailiff evict they every single one of those people will be face with anxiety about the future anxiety about have to pay eye watering moving cost and about whether they will be make completely homeless they can not afford to wait for the prime minister to find backbone and stand up to his party they can not afford to wait for the secretary of state to buy off his back benchers and they can not afford to wait yet more year for this government to keep the promise they make to they we stand ready to work in the national interest and will do so with anyone else who be prepared to join we urge the house not to waste this chance it will be obvious to the house that great many people want to catch my eye we have long time we have three hour ahead but want to be fair in the way that that be divide up so we will begin with time limit of seven minute in fellow housing expert calum mercer and publish then seminal paper call nation rent that paper challenge what be then the status quo which be that generation rent affect only young people and would be passing phase nation rent set out that it be change structural environment in the housing and financial market that have occur since which see rapid acceleration of the private rented sector overtake social rent together with fall in home ownership that structural change start long before the credit crunch and financial crash but accelerate after they decade on little have change in structural term and it should concern member of all party that generation rent have now become nation rent the percentage of people age between and and between and who be rent privately have triple over the past two decade and have more than double for those age between and nation rent be now embed not just in the young generation but through the generation as set out in my paper with the housing and finance institute time for good homes that structural change towards private renting affect around million home or around million people the need for legislation reflect that long term structural shift the private rented sector be no long flex or transitory tenure it be the main tenure for million of people for much if not all of their life the current legislative framework short term tenure for long term living one person pension pot but another person only home be not fit for that purpose that be why there be tension and strain which be reflect in the design of the bill and the comment that have be make about it there be need to find new balance that reflect this new reality for million of people in our country act in way that be fair and responsible to those who be be house as well as to those who house they it remain my view that although the principle of the bill and its measure be very welcome they do not go far enough in deal with the fundamental challenge of an overweighted private sector there need to be long term plan for housing that rebalance the housing tenure mix plan to boost home ownership and expand affordable rent housing substantially one that unblock the financial and regulatory constraint on affordable home ownership and professional renting and one that build more home continue to work cross party and cross industry inside and outside of this place on those priority as have do for many year and as be reflect in my entry in the register of members financial interests give my long term campaigning for housing be pleased to stand on manifesto to build million home this parliament work towards home year by the and scrap section eviction we have do well on the first the second be work in progress and the third manifesto commitment be why we be here today know at first hand the personal commitment that the secretary of state and the housing minister bring to this matter and how hard their commitment to it be this be vital piece of legislation because it seek to provide great security and stability for renter this matter and it should matter to everyone on the conservative benches because housing instability destroy wealth creation damage life chance restrict educational prospect and harm health see this in my constituency inbox as be sure do all member in my mp surgery have mother who have spend hundred of pound of her own money over many year build comfortable home for she and her disabled daughter only for they to be turf out by their landlord with nowhere to go recently have to discuss with ukrainian refugee how someone have complain to their landlord about the heating not work only for they to find themselves serve with section eviction notice how do you begin to explain that that be just how thing work in our country they should not work like that this need to change that be why this reform be so important but we can not allow any delay and that include the propose delay because supposedly repossession be take too long that be nonsense there be already clear court guidance to deal with repossession claim in timely manner as set out in civil procedure rule which state that the hearing must take place between four and eight week from the claim although there have be some spike in court hearing over the covid pandemic the timeliness of possession claim have remarkably improve the late available figure from the ministry of justice show that the average time between claim and order be now back to under eight week the average time between claim and warrant be the same as it be in december when the conservative commitment be make to the nation the repossession figure have collapse from the post covid high of week and be back on track to pre covid level for landlord every single median metric be that for order warrant or possession have dramatically improve on the late government datum therefore this landmark section reform should not be delay on the basis that court improvement be require that be concern of our select committee and think it have now be meet in part by the improved datum any change to the bill that delay the implementation of these vital reform can not be support this issue affect million of people in our country that be why renter reform specifically the abolition of section be in the manifesto on which all of we on the conservative benches stand it be manifesto that put the conservatives on the side of the people and manifesto that secure such huge majority it would be grave mistake not to honour that commitment or to stifle it by delay to conclude the renters reform bill will provide security and stability to million of renter across the country it should be pass by parliament without any further delay but we must also do more to continue to unlock home ownership and other housing to deliver the home and the housing stability that our nation need call the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee first put on record that be vice president of the local government association have consider the white paper and then the bill the select committee welcome in principle the proposal from the government to abolish section we hear evidence in number of session from organisation such as shelter look at the interest of tenant and from the national residential landlords association and they all accept that this be the right way to go and engage constructively with the select committee on that people home can be take away from they just like that when they have pay their rent and observe their tenancy condition and in principle that simply can not be right when home be take away people have to move somewhere else and their child have to uproot themselves from their school and be take to another school member of the family who work may have to find another job somewhere else because their home have move and they can no long get to their place of employment that simply be not right in this day and age we recognise as committee make this point in an intervention that there will be add work for the justice system because eviction will now require decision from the court and more tenant may feel empower to go to the court be really disappointed that the secretary of state be not go to indicate when he think the reform to the court system will be in place to allow the legislation to be enact think we need assurance today about when that will be that can not be an excuse for delay something that have already be delay for far too long want to point out one or two other issue welcome the secretary of state welcome for the work that the select committee have do even though his response be little late accept his apology for that we say very clearly in our report that enforcement by local authority will be absolutely key in make these change work there have to be proper funding for local authority as the local government association have say today to enable that work to be carry out properly we want assurance from the secretary of state on that as well one of the really good idea be the property portal so that tenant and all of we know who the landlord be we have suggest some change and some improvement on which think the secretary of state will come back to we to make sure that the property portal be comprehensive it should cover thing such as when the property last have gas safety certificate and when the electrical system in the house be properly inspect and information of that kind include whether it comply with the decent home standard all those thing be important and tenant should be able to access that quickly the register should be update and digitise which we be encourage the secretary of state to do we hope he will come back positively on that the cost for tenant be important we welcome the secretary of state say that rent increase can not take place more than once year but we have concern about the overload on the tribunal system and the way that those argument will be play out often with the landlord have great advantage we be not quite sure why the secretary of state be say that tenancy agreement could not have yearly update of rent in line with inflation with no need for argument that be actually the case in many rent agreement now while it have be difficult in the last couple of year with hyperinflation historically with inflation at about have not be an issue and it give some certainty to tenant we be not sure and we have not have an explanation why the government have rule that out completely come back to the point about tenant on benefit why can we not have ban on landlord automatically prohibit tenant on benefit from renting surely the secretary of state should do that and should indicate very quickly that he be prepared to accept that as an amendment to the bill strongly support the point that the hon gentleman have just make about the importance of the government outlaw these blanket ban on rent in the private sector by those who be in receipt of benefit have be see double whammy in that in constituency such as mine in twickenham rent have go up by over in the past year and as he say local housing allowance have not go up so people be evict and ban from rent if they be in receipt of benefit when they try to find new place pay tribute to the work of citizens advice richmond which have be run campaign on that we need to see the ban on such practice in place soon completely agree with those point and hope the secretary of state respond positively to they think the situation be of real concern and there be no reason why the ban can not be enact have already make the point about local housing allowance it be not part of the secretary of state department but it be part of government policy it be always go to be challenge for tenant to pay their rent in the private rent sector give the rise in rent recently but people on the low income and on benefit be now be exclude from most property because they simply can not afford it because their local housing allowance have be freeze the lha need to be lift even if the secretary of state can not say so today hope he be encourage those behind the scene who can make the change to make they in proper and timely way have couple of other point student housing be different the difference in student housing have be recognise where it be purpose build student housing in that it will be exempt from the ban on periodic tenancy that be entirely sensible recently we have see some real pressure on student accommodation in some university city last year manchester student be actually be encourage to live in liverpool because there be not enough housing in manchester for they that be just one of number of example in relation to protect the student market include non purpose build accommodation briefly wish to declare my interest as the parent of daughter who be currently at manchester university know exactly what the hon gentleman mean we will be do everything we can recognise that the secretary of state have respond to the committee report and while not allow complete reversal to periodic tenancy for non purpose build student accommodation landlord will have the right to terminate the tenancy in line with the university year think that be the basis of the proposal he be suggest that might well be good compromise to take thing forward and be sure the detail of that will be test far in committee on the proposal for the ombudsman the suggestion in an intervention from my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms about have one housing ombudsman and incorporate the private sector role into the social housing ombudsman role be very sensible why do we need two separate scheme for let agent why can we not have just one ombudsman cover the whole of that area at least everyone could understand it rather than have to think which bit do go to in order to get this grievance raise hope the secretary of state will reflect on that point which be simply make to ensure that the process of redress grievance work well member of the committee welcome the basic principle of the change propose by the secretary of state and we want they to be implement as quickly as possible we hope he will continue to listen to those recommendation that he have not yet indicate willingness to accept everybody agree that people deserve to live in rent home that be safe warm free from damp and mould and in which they can feel secure nobody doubt that intention or the fact that rogue landlord should be clamp down on and be make responsible however rogue landlord be the minority the secretary of state have say that on the floor of the house yet despite that the government seem to be tar every landlord with the same brush with the bill the ironic fact be that there be already plethora of legislation that allow local authority to clamp down on every housing issue include the scourge of the rogue landlord one issue be that council themselves be often the rogue cite resource as an excuse for inaction and with private landlord they already take action or at least have the power to take action if they so wish without wish to pinch the tv advertising slogan this bill do not do what it say on the tin it should be rename the rogue landlord and nightmare tenant bill because all it do be force good landlord to take action that they would not normally take to highlight what mean this be what have happen in the past the government force landlord to put deposit into government approve scheme which landlord do any landlord who have try to get money back from that scheme when tenant have cause damage will know that it be nigh on impossible so instead of put money into deposit scheme many landlord now do not take deposit instead they have increase rent in order to cover the cost the government do not treat private landlord as sole trader but instead treat the whole income from rent as taxable whether someone have mortgage on the property or not the result of that be increase rent the government stop pay landlord directly when tenant on benefit be in arrear instead say that the contract be with the tenant and not the government as result good landlord be now force to take rent in advance in the old day they use to take it in arrear as those tenant on benefit be pay by universal credit and they have increase the rent because of the high risk many many landlord do not take people on benefit as result of that the government say that they will legislate to make it illegal for landlord to discriminate against those on benefit but when landlord have between and applicant for each house all the legislation in the world will not make of difference because the landlord will always take the most risk free option one key component of the bill be the removal of section no fault eviction because of the time limit have have to strip load out of this speech madam deputy speaker leader romans group be one of the uk large property maintenance company indeed it have landlord client base of more than it take sample survey from those landlord and find that section of the housing act be rarely use rarely overused and even more rarely misuse of all those who respond to the survey have never use section of those who have significant majority over so because the tenant be in breach of the lease the english housing survey find that only of tenancy end at the landlord volition both figure demonstrate the fact that the vast majority of landlord do not evict tenant on whim to end no fault eviction through the abolition of section be extreme unnecessary and damaging to both landlord and tenant let give couple of example about use section eviction to replace section ground eight be currently the most heavily rely on ground for landlord try to gain repossession and it currently provide two week notice period it apply where the tenant be two month in rent arrear at the date of the section notice and the date of the possession hearing in the bill the notice period have be extend to four week also any outstanding universal credit payment that the tenant be due to receive be not to be include when calculate the arrear if the universal credit payment would reduce arrear below the two month threshold the government can not say to landlord on one hand that the contract for uc be between the landlord and the tenant but in the bill say that the landlord have to take off the pende uc payment for rent it be nonsense be short of time so will briefly mention expand the power for antisocial behaviour under section of the housing act it be unlikely to change the effect of ground which think this question be ask early be not mandatory but discretionary that mean that the judge have to consider whether it be reasonable to make possession order even if tenant be guilty of the allege conduct it be very unlikely that any court would consider some trivial conduct to justify possession order as have be mention several time the real issue be the inaction in build more house for people to live in that be not just this government but successive government the market will not change until government grasp the nettle and literally put spade in the ground as macmillan do in the there be reason why we have the homes for ukraine scheme it be because we do not have any house to put people in there be reason why over young man be stay in hotel in this country it be because we have no home to put they in the bill will do absolutely nothing to improve the rental market it will drive more landlord from the system the secretary of state say early that the number of landlord in this country have stay static since but would like to know exactly where he get that information from as it be not the information come from the market be my hon friend aware that just five day ago jones lang lasalle one of the big property consultant in the world publish report that analyse rightmove evidence of rental market availability it show that in the south east and south west of england rental availability be down by on be that cause by some of the thing my hon friend have be talk about my hon friend be absolutely right this be problem right throughout the country not just the south east it be happen in the north in calder valley wherever people be there be an absolute shortage of home whether socially or privately rent the bill will do nothing to improve the rental market it will drive more landlord from the system and because of those shortage of home to rent where dozen of people apply for any home that be available the bill will also do nothing to curb the rogue landlord element it be genuinely hard to overstate the scale of the housing crisis that we be in in every element of this crisis interact with every other element and they all feed off each other drive agree with the right hon member for calder valley craig whittaker on this one point by the failure to build enough home as well as the decline in home ownership particularly among the young the shrinking of the social rent sector the growth of the private rented sector especially as have be point out give the many different housing market within the private sector the growth of the private rent sector for those who be least able to afford that the growth of homelessness the pressure of housing cost drive particularly by the shortfall between the housing element of the social security budget and actual housing cost the collapse in legal aid and the advice sector and the pressure on local authority across the board that have lead to perfect storm at the sharp end of which be homelessness it be relief to have this bill with at least the promise that section will end because the section power be use for the most vulnerable and poor and drive people directly into the homelessness sector as an mp whose borough have the large proportion in the private rent sector anywhere in the country feel strongly about that it be profoundly worrying to hear that the government have backtrack four year after they first promise to abolish section the caveat we now have before we will mean in effect that there will be no progress on protect tenant over the come year it will be year before those power be bring into effect because one of the other element of this omni crisis be the shamble that be the court system we know that the ministry of justice take the single large proportion of all spending cut in the austerity budget and it be struggle to cope with the current system the sector have no plan and no provision to make the change that the secretary of state be rely on as preliminary for abolish section every day that go by mean that more people many highly vulnerable will face eviction on average london renter week have face no fault eviction since the government promise to bring an end to they in citizens advice say that it have help household with section case since this bill have its first reading six month delay would mean almost more londoner face no fault eviction and third of all no fault eviction in england in recent year have be in the capital it be london the most expensive place and the place with the great homelessness crisis that will bear the heavy burden as result of further delay by the secretary of state at the heart of all this be the tenant themselves for many people insecure tenancy be nuisance often an expensive one that keep they in state of permanent instability high level of population turnover be not good for strong community they be link to low level of participation at every level of civic society and they place particular strain on public service such as gps and school for the most vulnerable the private sector be live nightmare damage their physical and mental health all too often insecurity unaffordability and poor standard of accommodation come as single package place the great strain on those who can cope with it least my casework like that of many other member be sure be full of example like these one constituent write to we have be issue with section eviction letter by the landlord suffer from severe depression and recently have cornea eye transplant and be still undergo treatment my son have autism asthma be non verbal with severe sensory need and also struggle with change and we have both suffer serious mental health breakdown due to our current living condition these constituent have to wait until the court issue bailiff warrant for they to be move into alternative accommodation but due to the high level of backlog that the court be experience that will not be any time soon as she write this whole process have be severely detrimental to my mental health my concern be that our current property be safe as the kitchen ceiling be about to collapse in on we another constituent write this miscreant of landlord send section notice for possession of my apartment have be tenant there in good standing for three year rent be always pay on the due date rent be for tiny room with share toilet and shower with other tenant the landlord inform today that he want to raise the rent to an rent increase out of the clear blue sky third constituent write today my wife and be serve with no fault eviction principally for refuse to agree to an almost rent increase this be particularly gall because in february we have already have an increase of almost we now have just eight week to find place to live but as you know there be dearth of property not just in this area but other part of london they think it highly unlikely they will be able to find somewhere to live they continue be utterly dishearten that we live in country where this be possible it be nothing short of an outrage there be much in this bill that be good there be element promise for this bill that be not here and that we will want to press on and there be number of concern we will want to press on in committee to probe the government the central point be this tenant insecurity be extremely damaging it be bad for mental and physical health it be expensive and it place pressure on local authority the long that measure be delay the bad it will be the government have break their promise and we will be hold they to account for that failure this be without doubt significant bill which show that the conservative government be serious about deliver our manifesto commitment and deliver for the british people in my constituency tackle homelessness and rough sleeping be key priority to make in road we must reform the private rental market many of my constituent and people across the country be trap in high rental spiral with little or no other viable option available to they on that basis the bill proposal to enable tenant to appeal excessive market rent design to force out tenant could be an important step but we need to ensure we see more detail on how that would work in practice on top of that and more broadly we must go back to these proposal and make sure that they do not let up on the delivery of more affordable housing and social housing the housing minister my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean have hear say that time and again believe there be consensus across the house on that point as the bill progress will be keep strong look out for the appropriate protection for renter but we can not forget that without landlord we would not have rental market at all that be why we need to strike the right balance between assurance for landlord and protection for renter the tendency to vilify landlord be not just unhelpful to our public discourse it be unhelpful to how we be develop legislation we must make sure that we look after landlord in this process they form critical part of the housing ecosystem and scar they off would set we back even far so we must tread carefully through my role as chairman of the all party parliamentary group for housing market and housing delivery and from meet landlord and tenant in my constituency have engage with huge range of stakeholder include professional landlord such as grainger and charity such as shelter through those discussion be aware of the stick point that we need to resolve as we progress this bill through its remain stage to get into just one of the detail know we be push for time grainger and other in the industry favour the idea of introduce the ability for landlord to request six month minimum tenancy length once that period be over renter could issue two month notice responsible landlord such as grainger and many other in fact the vast majority of they want to build community and have last bond with the people they house which be an often forget point in these debate conversely charity that have be talk to that fight for the side of tenant and renter such as shelter want to see long protect period for tenant with focus on open end tendency they want to see the protect period lengthen from six month to two year to give renter more certainty and security in the light of proposal to introduce comprehensive possession ground for landlord we need to be careful that we find compromise between the two position the reform propose in the bill be promise and think we can all accept that they be step in the right direction however there be more work to be do in find the right balance between the need of renter and landlord and successfully integrate the rental market with our levelling up plan and the need to deliver more affordable housing across our country call feryal clark not here that be shock join colleague across the house in welcome this long overdue bill and share their dismay at the delay in implement ban on no fault eviction renter have be leave with soar rent and disrepair and be at the complete mercy of landlord powerless under the current system of no fault eviction to demand fair rent and humane living condition this be massive housing emergency across the country renter of all age and background from student to family young couple and single retiree be struggle to pay their rent let alone save for deposit to buy only half of private renter have any saving in their name with desperate lack of social housing liverpool alone have more than applicant on the council housing register and almost household in temporary accommodation the frontline housing option and homelessness service be see nearly new approach month council be rely on the private rent sector as the only way to ease the pressure on the system and renter be leave with no viable option an entire generation have be betray by the tories with year of austerity and rise rent frozen wage and diminish opportunity on top of that they have face unprecedented challenge cause by the financial crash recession the pandemic and now the cost of living crisis thirteen year of tory attack on worker and tenant right have leave renter face soar insecurity and plummet condition we urgently need the bill to be pass into law to begin to redress some of the bad impact of the deregulation nearly five year since the government propose to outlaw no fault eviction and give renter desperately need protection from exploitative landlord some household have be threaten with homelessness by section notice homelessness have skyrocket during the last year with the number of household in england who become homeless or be at risk of homelessness up in the year to march each day that we delay family be hand no fault eviction notice we can not wait for improvement in the court renter need protection now in my constituency as across the country we have increasingly see private landlord use no fault eviction to turf out tenant on fix term contract in order to hike up rent in line with soar market rate not content with wait out one year or two year long contract to raise rent and bolster profit landlord be take advantage of the cost of live crisis to line their pocket while tenant be turf out with nowhere to go citizens advice have find that shocking of renter who complain about their condition receive section notice within six month research by shelter support that with its finding show that private renter in england who complain about poor condition be time more likely to be hand an eviction notice end pernicious section eviction be major step in rebalancing power in favour of tenant but there be number of area where we need to go far to ensure that the bill measure have their intended consequence as call for by the renters reform coalition of the lead housing organisation first we must increase the notice period from two month to at least four month move that will drastically reduce the number of people make homeless as result of eviction we must also protect renter from eviction for the first two full year of tenancy not the six month propose we must introduce strong safeguard to prevent abuse of the new ground for eviction include financial incentive for tenant to prevent abuse and one year ban on re let property after invoke new landlord circumstance on the ground for eviction court must be give maximum discretion to identify reason why an eviction should not take place and cap on in tenancy rent increase in line with inflation and wage growth must be introduce to prevent unaffordable rent increase be use as way to evict tenant via the back door lastly we need action to raise local housing allowance in line with inflation to prevent renter on benefit from be penalise by rise rent and local authority must be give extra financial support to take action on rogue landlord everyone deserve safe and secure home the government must bring the bill into law immediately with the additional safeguard that member have outline to deliver desperately need robust legislation that protect renter be pleased to rise to speak on second reading of bill that fulfil manifesto promise and introduce number of measure ensure that renter get fair deal and more protection while maintain landlord essential control over their property acknowledge that there be both good landlord and tenant there be problematic one as well we must strike careful balance therefore as well as abolish section eviction and move to simple structure where tenancy be periodic to empower renter and provide they with more certainty the bill introduce reform to ensure that repossession where tenant be at fault be easy such as in case of repeat frequent arrear or antisocial behaviour the majority of landlord tenant relationship work well but where they break down early and effective dispute resolution be crucial the new private rent sector ombudsman will be able to provide impartial and bind resolution to issue however it be not full replacement for the court system therefore his majesty courts and tribunals service must be ready for the change welcome that some of that have already be raise indicate that there will be more digitising of the court process to make it simple and easy for landlord to use prioritise of certain case such as those include antisocial behaviour which can be significant issue for landlord and tenant alike in my constituency and the provision of early legal advice and well signpost for tenant include to help they find housing solution that meet their need urge the minister to work at pace with the justice secretary so that we can bring forward these measure as soon as possible my constituent in cheadle be animal lover so welcome that the bill will give tenant the right to request have pet in their property landlord will be require to consider those request and unable to refuse they unreasonably my hon friend be make an important point the people of southend west be great animal lover and many have write to to say that they have not be allow to have pet in private rent property what terrible thing that be for their mental health in southend have meet the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and be tell heartbreake tale of people have to give up their pet like she welcome the provision in the bill such that landlord can not unreasonably refuse request for pet but likewise landlord can demand that the tenant take out insurance against any damage that pet may do good balance act do she agree that give how important pet be to our physical and mental health those provision be to be much welcome certainly agree and my hon friend have pre empte many of my comment it be heartbreaking for many people to part with their pet in order to have roof over their head however as we know pet can sometimes cause damage and deterioration to property so it be important that landlord can insist on pet insurance to cover any damage cause as result however for clarity would be grateful if the minister could clear up query from constituent who express concern to about allow pet in share property in those circumstance what will constitute reasonable refusal for instance what if another resident with allergy or difficulty with animal complain will the minister make sure that acceptable reason for give that refusal be make clear as the secretary of state mention the proposal have be examine in committees as member of the levelling up housing and communities committee have have the opportunity to look closely into reform of the private rented sector examine the government proposal as set out in the white paper fairer private rent sector we hear from wide range of stakeholder with view across the spectrum the committee find that there be considerable support for the proposal of introduce an ombudsman for the sector far we hear evidence that many rogue landlord be not intentionally malicious but unaware of their obligation we hear that supporter of the bill hope it will be an effective place for resolution equally there be concern from landlord that it might create additional bureaucracy and concern from tenant group that it may take away the ability to go to court reassurance about the ease of use of the dispute mechanism would be welcome get the balance right be crucial over the summer meet tenant landlord and let agent such as cheadle base stuarts homes which facilitate tenant and landlord on daily basis be grateful to all my local resident tenant and business for give their view as with any legislation or policy we must consider any unintended consequence and seek to balance the protection of tenant with the right of landlord hear about potential issue with the debt respite scheme also know as breathe space it be introduce in to help those experience debt and provide individual with day period in which interest and charge on their debt be frozen and enforcement action from creditor be pause that be pair with requirement to seek professional support to create repayment plan the scheme will have come as relief to many however have listen to concern that some tenant have misuse it to prevent eviction in case of long stand non payment of rent the stress of non payment of rent sometimes for month on end affect landlord who be unable to take possession of their property and be owe thousand of pound in rent which they fear they will never recoup meanwhile have constituent in cheadle who be landlord operate student let they have express concern about the abolition of fix term let be tell that it may prevent landlord from secure tenant ahead of time for the next academic year thereby take away certainty and security for both landlord and student who want to know their housing situation be sort ahead of time be give an example by constituent of where rental agreement be share and if student leave the other be in theory liable for the extra share of rent however in practice the student leave find suitable replacement the lease be transfer and the depart resident get their deposit back as such my constituent feel that move to roll tenancy as the bill propose would be unsuitable for student let be reassure that that be be consider again we also hear during session of the levelling up housing and communities committee that the change could negatively impact the rental market make it unattractive for landlord to let to student understand that the secretary of state have plan to introduce new ground for possession which will facilitate short term student tenancy but the committee and my constituent recommend give consideration to retain fix term for the student rental market although be pleased that the government recognise the unique position of student accommodation in the rental market ask they to look at do that the bill make some much need change but ask the government to listen to the outstanding concern raise by those directly affected the tenant and the landlord we must ensure that we do not create unintended negative consequence or further problem that negate the good work of the bill in closing reiterate my overall support for these measure and look forward to follow the bill as it move through the legislative process almost of my constituent be private renter and be pleased to have the opportunity to reflect their concern of those many be student think have the large number of student of any member in the country and want to raise their concern as chair of the all party parliamentary group for student be one of cross party group of parliamentarian who write recently to the secretary of state urge he to bring forward this legislation so be delighted that we have it do so primarily because of its promise to fulfil the government pledge to end no fault section eviction so it be bitter disappointment that the government appear to have frustrate the hope of tenant by kick the abolition of section notice down the road to some potentially distant future after further change to the court system something that see that the national residential landlords association have celebrate in statement today as result of its extensive lobbying hope that the government will think again or at least give we an assurance this evening of the date when they plan to fulfil the ambition for no fault eviction hope the government will go far in deliver the promise new deal for private renter in other area because share the concern of the renters reform coalition that the bill need amend to ensure that the propose landlord circumstance ground for eviction do not become the new section the tenant should be give four month notice rather than two there should be one year ban on re letting after invoke the new landlord circumstance rather than the propose three month we need strong mechanism than those propose to stop unaffordable rent increase of which we have hear example already this evening pricing tenant out and become the new section we need to ensure that tenant can be confident in raise issue and make complaint without fear of retaliation hope that those issue will be consider seriously in committee want to raise the concern of student renter there be an exemption for purpose build student accommodation but many student live in the part of the private rent sector that be cover by the bill around of they or across england and wales their voice have not be fully hear which our all party group have be try to address in may we hold roundtable with student representative from most of our major city and many of our small town they agree that there be many positive element to the bill but raise issue that need further clarification if it be to succeed for all renter see that in his response to the select committee the secretary of state accept the argument of landlord that the student market be cyclical and landlord must be able to guarantee possession each year for new set of tenant he go on to state that we will introduce new ground for possession to facilitate this understand that case and it be reflect in some of the student voice that we hear but we need to take care about how we do it because there be an underlie false assumption in the discourse around the issue that all student fit traditional stereotype on three year undergraduate course want month contract and leave their university town when they finish their study however student be not homogeneous undergraduate and postgraduate have different requirement there be week programme and week programme some course start at different time of the year and have different cycle there be mature and part time student student with family estranged student international student graduate apprentice those who stay on to study or work during vacation while their friend do not and those who want to make their university house permanent home many student live in mixed household with recent graduate or other non student it simply would not work to have people in mixed household on share tenancy with different right ground for possession clause might protect the market but one size fit all approach will not address the fact that not all student want property that be cyclical with the standard undergraduate year so we need clear definition of student and how ground for possession will be implement would welcome some acknowledgement from the minister in wind up this evening that the government have give consideration to those complexity in their proposal in relation to student we also have to recognise that the student market differ greatly across the country large city be different from small town and urban and rural base university be different again the higher education policy institute study of the scottish experience highlight the risk in tourist area or in other area with low supply and high rent that not exempt student will encourage landlord to move out of student accommodation student representative express concern to we about be price out in some area by young professional on the other hand there be worry that exempt student in some area will risk they become second class renter attract less scrupulous landlord into student accommodation because they be relatively unprotected tenant student renter face many of the same issue as other renter and they deserve the same broad protection they face specific issue too the raise with we the grow pressure they be under to view and sign tenancy agreement for property early and early each year often in this term early in the academic session before friendship group be form leave they lock into unwanted contract the bill do not address that but student feel that it should there be other question that need address if we be to exempt student what happen if renter student status change during the tenancy how will the bill address the issue of joint tenancy to conclude simply say to the minister that we should not rush to exempt student from the protection in the bill relate to no fault eviction and keep they uniquely lock into fix term tenancy without careful consideration of the impact on all type of student in all part of england and wales even then we need to ensure they continue enjoy the protection in the bill hope the minister will agree to meet the all party parliamentary group for student and student representative to hear our concern must declare that own half of rental property with my wife and should therefore refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests want to start by talk about one of my favourite subject in this place have often speak in the house about the impact of second home in my constituency while they bring many economic benefit we must also face the fact that quite often they turbocharge the market push up price and make home ownership simply dream for many local people it be no big secret that north norfolk have the high proportion of second home in the country outside london in addition one in five property be private rental however with an increase number of holiday let and second home for many local people the availability of secure long term rental be diminish year on year that be particularly worry in constituency such as mine be very grateful to my hon friend whose area know well because declare an interest farm in his constituency also have rental property what he be say be absolutely correct the bill will have disastrous effect on area such as his and mine reduce the number of rental property and therefore increase the price of rent for youngster that be really serious thank my hon friend for intervene do not agree at all actually in constituency like mine people have real problem with the security of rental property if they be evict it be virtually impossible for they to find somewhere else to rent in short space of time at the moment deal with query about that all the time but will come on to that in just moment it be worry that for so many who be look to settle down in family home of their own renting be become the only option due to rise house price for example on friday bump into local estate agent in one of my big town north walsham he tell he have applicant for every rental property that come on to the market the demand be just off the scale clearly that be really huge problem there be simply not enough rental market security when demand be rise as it be now clearly be conservative and be not against people want to purchase property in norfolk as second home if one work hard in life one should have the choice to spend one finance as one wish but also believe that when the market begin to fail intervention be sometimes necessary and that be where we be at the moment many second home for instance be leave vacant for large part of the year reduce the property pool and once again reduce the availability of home for resident to rent although holiday let and vacant second home be not the focus of my speech today follow conversation have have with many of my constituent especially jane platt whom meet when she come all the way from north norfolk to parliament back in march know how unsettled and insecure tenant can feel in the sector as it currently stand that fear be exacerbate in area such as north norfolk because if landlord decide to serve an eviction notice give everything have just say there would simply be so little choice available for renter who need to find new home quickly indeed sadly just in the four year have be in this place have try to help many desperate family find suitable home to rent that be at the pinnacle of why support the bill the government be try to help many initiative have come forward be parliamentary private secretary in the department for levelling up housing and communities for short period of time double council tax on second home planning change for short term rental and now this bill show that the government be commit to fulfil their manifesto commitment to introduce reform that will provide family across the uk with that extra reassurance that they will be able to settle into family home and be free from in certain case unfair eviction and in very limited circumstance landlord who do not act in correct way many landlord and tenant be good honest and decent people they be the norm the private landlord be in my view the answer to the rental crisis we face but only if they be incentivise properly for example with tax reform gently suggest that in some regard we could go far with some of the government proposal to ensure that good and decent tenant feel secure in the private rental sector and feel they can put down root it might not be big issue for some member but as other have say enable someone to have pet in their home as allow be certainly right in the century when so many people treat family pet as part of their family there be large support across the board for the government current proposal and be not suggest that they be materially change however believe there be some valid conversation to be have around increase notice period from two to four month to give people time to find new home have say it before but in my constituency and in many other for instance in the south west doubt anyone could find another rental property in two month such be the enormous shortage in addition would potentially improve the protect period at the start of the tenancy from six month to at least year as well as make all ground discretionary rather than mandatory so that court can take into account tenant circumstance before grant possession above all have say this to various ministers before why can we not incentivise long term landlord to return to the market by offer mortgage interest relief on long term tenancy in constituency such as mine so many people offer short term rental in their holiday cottage and on airbnb but if we could switch those people to offer long term tenancy on their property by give they mortgage interest relief it would fundamentally change the situation overnight and give more renter market security it would seriously improve the amount of rental stock we have available appreciate the need to safeguard landlord from antisocial tenant and to allow they to get their property back when need we have hear that this evening however the tightening of some of the government proposal would not cause an exodus of landlord from the sector or prevent they do what they wish with their asset as say before own part share and do not have any fear at all when landlord have good relationship with their tenant that be how it work operate good relationship generally people who be try to rent be decent people create fair more secure and thriving rental sector be achievable and this bill be the first step rise order just for the sake of clarity let say that be grateful to the hon member for north norfolk duncan baker he take the correct allot time there seem to be mistake with the clock but the hon gentleman have do the honourable thing and thank he very much for that let first draw member attention to my own entry in the register of members financial interests be also half residential landlord the bill have take far too long to reach this stage it be more than four year since the government manifesto pledge and now in the die month of the current parliament the bill have only just reach second reading broadly however my liberal democrat colleague and support it and will vote for it this evening any legislation that pave the way towards fair situation for both renter and landlord must be welcome most important be the end of no fault eviction and shall say more about that shortly we also welcome clause that will allow renter to keep pet in their home and the creation of housing ombudsman which will enable decision to be make more quickly and cheaply for tenant and landlord security for both tenant and landlord be vital and it be essential that in provide that security for tenant we do not inadvertently cause an exodus of landlord from the rental market the country land and business association have find that of landlord plan to sell or change the use of their rental property in the next two year which be cause for concern because at the same time we be see an increase in the number of people enter the private rental market rightmove estimate that for every property advertise for rent there be applicant whereas there be just eight in we need to ensure that we be incentivise landlord to stay in the market and to give renter security once they manage to become that one person in to secure property to rent the length of rental tenancy be an important element in that regard in its current form the bill introduce roll tenancy without specified end date that provide considerable security for tenant but the six month protect period be potentially too short meanwhile of landlord do not have portfolio of property they have just one so the risk of empty month be significant for they provide long term tenure might alleviate that risk and remove an incentive for landlord to exit the market the liberal democrats proposal be to extend the default tenancy from one to three year and during that three year period only to allow rent to increase by the rate of inflation that would give both renter and landlords great stability as mention early the liberal democrats welcome the banning of section or no fault eviction be sure that member on both side of the house have have an enormous amount of casework feature for many renter sudden and drastic upheaval in their everyday life cause by section eviction such eviction leave people stress about their security of tenure and worry about not have somewhere to call their home and can pull the rug from under their foot they can require people to move to new area force they to find new school for their child or new job for themselves and try to settle into new community that be particularly significant at present because more family than ever be live in private rent accommodation and accord to the renters reform coalition million renter household include child the government commitment to abolish those type of eviction and legislate for landlord to be able to evict only in reasonable circumstance be therefore welcome step towards ensure that renter right be protect in law it will also ensure that tenant live in property suffer from disrepair or even infestation can report such issue to their landlord without the fear of revenge eviction it should drive up standard particularly if couple with long tenancy as always however there be balance to be strike between provide security for tenant and ensure that the legislation do not cause an exodus of landlord from the sector it remain important for landlord to be able to remove tenant who be genuinely damage their property or the surround community but hope that the minister will make the definition of what will enable that to happen absolutely clear it be also important to guard against landlord be able to use flimsy excuse to evict tenant allow section eviction to continue in all but name hope that the minister will elaborate on the reform of the legal system that will be necessary to allow landlord to evict when there be non payment of rent unreasonable damage to property or clearly define antisocial behaviour or genuine change in landlord circumstance prompt and fair court process be obviously essential to retain landlord confidence in reform system but delay in that process should not be use as mechanism to kick this important legislation into the long grass the quality of rental housing must also be consider black mould damp faulty boiler be sure we be all aware of the difficult condition that some rental property be leave in say some with great seriousness because not all private landlord leave their property in disrepair but we must make the bill robust enough to challenge those who do the government have previously promise to introduce legislation at the early opportunity to apply the decent home standard to the private rent sector find it concern that that legislation have not be introduce and the government have instead announce that they will delay the requirement that will force private landlord to meet energy performance certificate standard understand the cautious approach in ensure stability of supply in the private rented sector but responsible landlord should not baulk at take measure over reasonable timescale that will enhance the value of their asset also understand the concern about the usefulness of the epc but it should be possible to revisit that and phase in more effective measure of energy efficiency rather than abandon it altogether provide certainty and fixed timetable that landlord should be able to work to without such measure the bill risk offer rogue landlord an easy escape route when it come to improve the quality of the property the bill be well late than never but urge the government to revisit the issue of length of tenancy to clarify the circumstance in which and the legal process through which landlord would legitimately be able to evict problematic tenant or sell the property and to consider include decent home standard so that those renting privately can be sure of safe and warm home for themselves and their family let end by call for rapid increase in the building of social housing because shortage of supply be behind all these issue in the private rented sector and it leave far too much power in the hand of landlord have no financial interest in the bill be not landlord have never be one and have no desire to be one it sound like very stressful job however do declare personal interest because be the father of young people in their and and be increasingly worried about their lack of opportunity to buy their own home or indeed rent home my generation be fortunate in experience full employment buoyant housing and rental market and low level of net migration be able to buy my first house although it be bit of struggle for the opportunity for young people be so difficult now and think they should be at the forefront of our thought they be overwhelmingly reliant on the rental sector for accommodation the housing crunch mean that they have to rent for large proportion of their life and the government benchmark for an unaffordable level of rent be of income as of last year four in in england scotland and wales be now pay rent that the government consider unaffordable the crisis be drive by massive shortage of supply policy such as help to buy only help to increase demand while do nothing when it come to supply only massive comprehensive planning reform can solve this problem we have to build many more house and we have to free up the rented sector we need public spirited mentality many old people have work hard and have purchase their home but they be undermine the ability of young people to do the same by object to new housing proposal and of course when they object they be also object to the ability of their own child and grandchild to get on to the housing market much opposition to new housing be due to the fact that it be often poorly build and development lack the upscaling in infrastructure that be need to support it we need to adopt holistic approach the housing shortage mean that first time buyer have little to choose from and delay they from get on to the property ladder young people wage have not keep up with the rise cost of living and housing they be force to spend more and more of their money on rent leave less room for saving pay off debt and spend money which will flow into the general economy rent increase be outpace wage growth in most of the uk know that many member and rental reformer have argue in favour of get rid of no fault eviction to help give renter security but believe the reality be the opposite ban no fault eviction will make the rental market even more stagnant and will lead to its dry up far urge the government if the bill become law as be sure it will with labour support to allow cool off period so that over the next year more and more landlord do not just get out of the sector altogether apart from add to the burden of landlord we do not want to see what happen when ireland do this the regulatory burden on landlord there be such that the rental sector shrink massively and government have pay the price in term of popularity the number of available property for rent in ireland have shrink to record low temporary eviction ban there end at the end of march this year and do nothing to alleviate the shortage no fault eviction be in some sense legal fiction evict tenant for fault be complex process and the burden be on the landlord to prove breach of tenancy arrear of rent nuisance or antisocial behaviour criminal activity or substantial disrepair depend on the tenancy the notice period could be as short as two week or as long as several month notice procedure be highly regulated and must observe the prescribed format failure to observe this down to the letter of the law can render notice invalid delay eviction if the premise be not vacate it be up to the landlord to initiate costly legal proceeding let we look at what happen in the past in under harold macmillan as housing minister more than new dwelling be complete in the year before the pandemic just new dwelling be build in the statistical year end march people come to live in the uk with emigrate from the uk that be net migration figure of people on top of the housing shortage that already exist the post covid statistic be even bad the office for national statistics estimate that net migration to the uk in be the same year energy performance certificate datum suggest that just home be build the number of people we be let into the country be time the number of new dwelling we be build this be crisis and it need to be address this do not take into account the fact that even without these newcomer there be already squeeze on housing we welcome the fact that we have ukrainians come here and perhaps we have not do enough but we have also welcome people from afghanistan no one be claim that we should not have take in these refugee in genuine need but we need to be realistic if we be let in these people in need we need to severely curtail other migration not just illegal migration but legal immigration in order to stay afloat and give our own young people chance to buy and rent house young and less well off people be be leave to shoulder the burden house builder face complex and lengthy planning process that slow down development and can not agree with the government on remove housing target we need to reimpose housing target on local authority and we need massive house building drive we need to give many more people the opportunity to rent and we need to control net migration for all these reason can not support the bill tonight today second reading of the renters reform bill be long overdue but as many have already say it unfortunately do not go far enough in many area since the government first promise to end section no fault eviction household have be evict or threaten with homelessness everybody deserve to have safe decent and affordable home but sadly on the tories watch mortgage bill and rent be soar few people can buy their own home and over million people be still stick on social housing waiting list my constituency be one of the young in the country and have high number of private and social renter than the national average average house price be more than which be around time the average annual salary make it much hard for many to get on to the housing ladder all too often that leave they trap in the private rent sector the renters reform coalition have rightly assert that the private rented sector in england be characterise by poor standard lack of affordability discrimination and most importantly insecurity regularly receive correspondence from constituent complain about the poor living standard and eye water rent that they be face that be why ask the secretary of state early why he would not bring forward provision in the bill to address the issue around decent standard renter have never be so exposed or so desperately in need of government action to establish fair more secure and more affordable private rent sector in london private rent rise by over in the year to this september which be the high for over decade the average rent in london be the equivalent of of the average household income compare with just across england the lack of protection for renter be play huge role in these trend that be why reform of this sector be vital but more need to be do to protect renter and to ensure that they can live in home that be safe decent and affordable the bill as it stand do nothing to address the cost of renting which have skyrocket it contain no requirement for privately rent home to meet the decent home standard or provision to increase council investigative and enforcement power the bill will eventually remove section no fault eviction but it still have many issue renter will be protect from eviction only for the first six month of their tenancy rather than the two year that many across the sector have be call for they will be entitle to receive only two month notice of an eviction rather than four month which would give they more security and landlord will be ban from relette property after evict tenant on new ground for only three month rather than for year while the bill strengthen the law to ensure that landlord can increase rent only once year the mechanism for tenant to contest increase that be too high be not strong enough we need to see cap on tenancy rent increase at either the low end of inflation or wage growth also want to touch on pet in private rent home this be an issue have be work on with battersea dogs and cats home in my constituency and an issue that many of my constituent have be write to about it be something that they care about for many people their pet bring they physical mental and social health benefit as they be an integral part of many family unit it be vital that we ensure that clause and be protect in the bill so that tenant have legal right to request pet in the property and the landlord must consider that request and not refuse it unnecessarily this bill alone will not solve the housing crisis in the private rented sector and the government must look at wholesale reform of the sector labour have commit once in government to increase the affordable housing supply and the mayor of london have already invest over billion in build genuinely affordable home there be so much more that the government can do they could look at unfreeze the local housing allowance and restore the link between the lha and rise rent it have be freeze for too many year and it be totally out of step with the cost of renting for many in this sector shelter have show that low income renter be be force to find on average an additional for one bedroom property which be virtually impossible for many this bill only scratch the surface on fix the housing emergency create by the conservatives to protect our constituent more need to be do in every way to ensure that everybody have safe decent and affordable home to live in this be the level of ambition that we need but unfortunately it have be miss from this government draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests look at the housing market we know that the problem be when people feel insecure generally speak those who own their own home or who be in council housing feel secure but the private rented sector because it be focus on very short term let cause problem one year tenancy be not problem for mobile young man but if he have family with child at school and work in the locality and if he be unlucky enough to have go from one private landlord to another over half dozen year before be evict it will have major effect on the family life chance the kid might not be able to go to school they might have long bus ride and sometimes their exam might be affect sometimes parent have to change job it be laudable for the government to try to lengthen tenancy in order to provide little more security for those in the private rented sector but be not sure whether the formula in this bill will actually do that like some of my colleague be somewhat sceptical there be quite lot of room to improve the bill as my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker say the bill would probably be more effective if landlord be incentivise to keep tenant for long by be able to claim their mortgage interest against tax we would then end up with market that be much more logical and well for tenant who want long term secure tenancy in other word fiscal intervention would be more likely to succeed than many of the intervention the government be currently suggest of course as many member have say one solution be to build more house more for people to buy and more for council housing it be bizarre that some local authority have get into trouble buy shopping centre and pv farm when actually the money would have be much well spend on provide people with decent home we all know that our local authority spend lot of money on put people in temporary accommodation with possibly only microwave to heat their food investment in home which be good for people mental wellbeing and their child upbringing should be the priority of any government rather than be question of right or leave as government we ought to focus more on building than on mess about with manage the housing market be concerned that some thing in the bill may well put off private landlord sometimes feel that private landlord have thankless task they tend to get kick by everybody even though they be try to do the right thing fundamentally if we make it more difficult for landlord to get their property they will think twice before rent it out we have to be extremely careful when we legislate in this area because the consequence of make it more difficult for private owner be that we may well end up with more people be evict and more people fall on the council for home the secretary of state introduce the bill with his usual panache but be amazed that two large area have not really be include first the bill will not work for student accommodation and in fact could have very perverse incentive the hon member for sheffield central paul blomfield be an expert in this sector and he make some interesting observation he ask what would happen if we have this system and try to introduce separate system for student where student live with somebody who be in work there be all sort of difficulty that the bill will have to iron out it be vital that those who have invest in property near our university our university seem to be property company as far as can see have the certainty of one year move on when another year come in in good time so that people can sort out their accommodation we really should tell people what we be do when we introduce bill rather than wait for what might come out during the bill passage my other concern be about move from section which be clearly blunt instrument to the court we currently have major backlog in our court on which think they be make some progress but the bill will inevitably slow down the process for landlord the chairman of the select committee the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts suggest that perhaps there ought to be property court to fast track the complaint there be all sort of issue throughout most of my parliamentary career when people have come to my surgery to say that they be go to court have tend to say do do it in this instance the government be try to get people to go into the legal system and worry that it will take long worry whether this be the right solution for either tenant or property owner have the government do proper assessment be we confident that the system will work the bill have be introduce on promise that it will be sort out but the court be the responsibility of another department not the department for levelling up housing and communities worry about that this bill be not fully form but think it could be improve it be one of those bills for which committee consideration will be vital will support the government tonight but will be look very carefully at how the bill be improve as it go through this house for my constituent in liverpool west derby and for million across the country the private rent sector be the only housing option available because of the disastrous turning away from the post war mass council house provision those long term political decision have lead we to our current crisis the private rented sector have utterly fail to provide home that be decent affordable and allow people to live in safety security and dignity more than one in privately rent home contain category hazard that could kill or seriously maim and tenant who raise complaint be two and half time more likely to be hand an eviction notice which often lead to forced move that be disruptive to the family and to child education local authority have have their resource and capability decimate under the government austerity programme this morning alone three family in west derby have contact my office after be give an eviction notice by private landlord with housing provision scant in liverpool have previously raise in the house the case of my constituent with asthma whose landlord leave he in damp property with no gas supply in the middle of winter have raise the case of constituent include child who be hospitalise and suffer serious health impact as result of disrepair in privately rent home and case of family live in fear of bailiff have be serve section notice by their landlord after complain about terrible condition in their home one constituent say section take the humanity out of the situation and that precisely the problem we be human and our life be be carelessly destroy since raise these case year and half ago my constituent have see no change to the law so we finally welcome the second reading of the renters reform bill which we hope might at least bring an end to the nightmare of section no fault eviction the delay to the bill have be shameful nearly quarter of million private renter have be serve with no fault eviction notice since the government first pledge to ban they in april during the delay between first reading and second reading alone citizens advice have have to help more than people with section eviction the secretary of state have now say implementation of the reform in this bill will proceed until further improvement be in place and hmct be fully prepared for these change how long will that take can the secretary of state explain how this commitment will be reflect in legislation my constituent and hundred of thousand of other have zero faith that they will ever see ban on section eviction under this government because they have see year of the government complete destruction of the justice system which have cause so much damage to those seek justice in so many section of society include housing sit on the levelling up housing and communities committee from the secretary of state response to the committee report it feel as if the ideological destruction of the justice system by his government be now be use as cover to bow down to the lobbying from landlord many of they seem to be on his back benches and to kick the ban of section into the long grass add to that be the concern of tenant union and charity who welcome the ban on section eviction but be concerned that the bill will replace section with potential loophole for landlord to evict tenant under other term that be unfair or extremely vaguely define they be also concerned that landlord will continue to be able in effect to evict tenant by raise rent to unsustainable level hope that the secretary of state will address those fear and loophole when the bill be in committee this bill should be an opportunity to empower tenant and hardwire social justice into the system so many people be look to the bill to rebalance the scale of justice which be weight so heavily against tenant and so in favour of profit any delay in bring in no loophole ban on section eviction really be unforgivable nation await refer hon member to my declaration on the register of members financial interests have be landlord for plus year should also note that have be tenant too wise man once say the first lesson of economic be scarcity there be never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it he also say the first lesson of politic be to disregard the first lesson of economic whenever this be the case there be disastrous consequence we see this every time labour be elect who among we will ever forget the note that labour leave we in it say afraid there be no money kind regard and good luck as conservative we understand the importance of sound economic and try not to interfere with the market yet be concerned that this bill may be guilty of just that the bill could well result in few property to rent and in sky high rent thank the secretary of state for meet in edlington in my constituency show he at first hand the problem that landlord and constituent be face as result of the decade of neglect that the area have face under doncaster labour control council be still hopeful that levelling up funding will help to transform this part of my constituency have write plan for edlington which know my right hon friend have read on positive note he will be pleased to know that his visit have buck up all the stakeholder they be now begin to address issue that have raise my constituent be very grateful as be also thank the secretary of state for his recent letter to in which he announce change that he have make to the bill they be need that prove that the secretary of state be willing to listen but there remain many issue that need address the simple fact of the matter be that the more bureaucratic and difficult we make renting for landlord the more incentive they will have to sell up and reduce the number of property on the market to let with few property for rent scarcity mean that rent will increase be that what tenant want we should be help landlord and tenant equally not one over the other savill have carry out research on the issue and ten of thousand of landlord be do just that sell up more be expect to follow there be those who say so what if the landlord sell what be all the worry the house be go nowhere if it be sell an owner occupier or another landlord will buy it they be right and if an owner occupier do buy it that be fine but if good landlord can not make property pay they may just sell to an unscrupulous landlord who will make it pay be that what we seek to do to make the property market so costly and so bureaucratic that only the cowboy landlord can make it pay do hope not by bring this bill forward the government will inadvertently increase the rent that many of my constituent be pay no doubt that will reduce the quality of the property too that can not be right try to protect any increase in rent by allow only annual increase will no doubt result in landlord put up the rent each year it make sense that be what happen when the market be interfere with yet prior to the scheme come into effect many landlord have allow good tenant to pay rent at the same rate year on year rolling tenancy give neither the landlord nor the tenant any security to allow notice to be give from day one be be afraid nothing short of ludicrous be not sure whether the secretary of state have ever have to try and find new tenant tidy up property after the last tenant abscond be job in itself and then there be advertise the property deal with score of viewing and deal with agreement deposit scheme and so on to go through all that and then allow tenant to give notice on day one and leave after two month be as say ludicrous can understand the attraction of an ombudsman and database but we must be realistic this will only add cost either that will be another reason for landlord to quit the sector or it will increase the tenant rent tenant should see that these proposal will end up cost they hundred of pound every month be sure the government intention be honourable but the fact remain that although the bill may initially look favourable to many it simply be not we should be careful not to follow the socialist path many socialist policy look good for politician that be why they win election but that failure to understand the market and basic economic be why they always end up bankrupt the country conservative members understand economic and want to do the right thing for the right reason no matter how it look that be the reason be conservative ask the government again to listen to the industry and to meet once more let we not do what that wise man thomas sowell say of politician and disregard the first lesson of economic the outcome will always be bad for those who can least afford it which will be many of my constituent the housing system be rig against renter in britain today on average private renter spend about third of their income on rent on property that be disproportionately in shoddy condition where problem such as damp and mould be rife and thing be get bad rent have soar to record high and have go up outside london in the past four year home in england be on average not only the small in europe but in the bad condition and among the least affordable the right that renter have to live in these often overprice overcrowded and unsafe home be pathetically weak with no fault eviction notice hand to private renter every three minute many renter be force into homelessness research show that renter be so worried about the risk of be evict that they often do not ask their landlord for vital repair or challenge grossly unfair rent hike in my constituency recently have case that highlight the need for strong renter right and the abolition of no fault eviction have live in her home for year mandy and her two son be issue with no fault eviction give they just two month to find new home as mandy say the threat of eviction be so stressful the thought of have to move my family into temporary accommodation away from our community have keep up at night this be particularly difficult for one of her young son who be disabled and have complex need with the family on the brink of homelessness and bailiff turn up the community tenant union acorn step in and support mandy and her family which allow more time to find new home be pleased to say that with the eviction delay they find new home but not everyone be so lucky that be why no fault eviction need to be ban although on paper that be what the bill say it will do share colleague concern not only be the bill fill with loophole give unscrupulous landlord opportunity to get round the scrapping of no fault eviction but today it be reveal that the government will indefinitely delay introduce the ban promise that it will come into effect only after court reform have be implement and who know when that will happen of course this delay have be welcome by the landlord lobby and no doubt by many landlord on the government benches the government promise new deal for private renter with quality affordability and fairness at its heart but this bill be far too little far too late renter do not just need real watertight ban on no fault eviction they need rent cap and an end to ever soar rent rise they need an end to the thatcherite right to buy and the privatisation of council home which have see two third of council home sell off and almost half be buy up by private landlord only to be lease out again at far high rent renter also need government lead council house building programme to build hundred of thousand of high quality new home own by the council obviously every year ultimately we need government who shift the balance away from bad landlord and big property developer in favour of renter and working class community we have mandate from the british people to deliver this bill and know that pass it into law will be warmly welcome by renter in the million household who be rent nationwide support and fairness be what this bill deliver to both renter and landlord alike last year the english housing survey identify that of privately rent property do not meet the decent home standard the consequence of unsafe rental property cost the nhs million each year be sure that we can agree that this be an unnecessary cost but it be make up of thousand upon thousand of individual story of miserable living condition from day one in this job and sadly week in and week out much of my casework have involve poor housing condition resolve these issue give my caseworking team diana mollie and enormous satisfaction but it be distress to hear of the health impact on vulnerable constituent that be bring to the fore for all of we with the news at the beginning of the year of the death of two year old awaab ishak in rochdale from respiratory issue cause by exposure to mould hope that we can all agree across the house that no family should suffer the loss of child in that way fear of eviction should not be reason for not ask for repair to be do since assure shorthold tenancy be introduce renter have be offer no long term security of tenure and private landlord have be able to repossess their property without any establishment of wrongdoing by the tenant however that be not to say that many landlord do not do an excellent job in deliver good quality housing and support to their tenant while exercise their right properly and with good intention the goal be to increase their number and for more landlord to follow their example large number of my constituent in guildford have write to in support of the bill for many reason include the provision that will give tenant the right to request pet in their property and enable landlord to require pet insurance to cover any damage my constituent think that be great idea as pet owner wholly agree with they have also be consider the issue of tenancy length with student in guildford in mind there be some fundamental that we need to get right landlord need full access to their property after term finish in the summer to prepare they for their next tenant in the autumn be pleased that the secretary of state give reassurance on student let in his opening speech between and the conservative government reduce the number of non decent private rental home by the secretary of state think we can go far and so do see the impact of the lack of regulation in the private rent sector in my constituency every single week in dulwich and west norwood rent have be spiral for many year and all too often the quality of accommodation fall way below what any tenant should be able to expect have in my constituency landlord who own home in development call dorchester court the landlord be on the sunday times rich list their property be in an absolutely dire state wooden prop support the window frame plastic sheet act as an ineffective shield against moisture penetrate the wall the heating be unreliable in the winter the water pipe be make from lead which contaminate the water supply to level that be not safe for human health the council have be try for number of year to take enforcement action against this landlord but it have be wait many month for court date in the meantime the same landlord have use section eviction notice in way that in my experience be entirely common simply to ratchet up rent tenant be serve with section notice terminate the tenancy alongside an offer of new tenancy at high level often significantly high level of rent if any member doubt the need for additional regulation of the private rented sector they should visit dorchester court in my constituency and in five minute they will see how the regulatory framework be fail tenant across the country section allow for landlord to get their property back when they have legitimate reason to do so section be pernicious destabilising force in the housing rental market and there be no place for it the consequence of section be more than simply contractual they be find in poor mental health and anxiety in increase homelessness and financial hardship in child live in accommodation that no child should have to live in and in child have to worry about the anxiety that their parent be experience because of the possibility of lose their home at any time it be very disappointing that the government be delay the ban on section eviction by allow loophole in this legislation sincerely hope that in committee they will reconsider their position turn now to an amendment to the bill that plan to table early this year my constituent lose their son first year university student to suicide devastating loss for any parent to bear their son have sign tenancy for his second year accommodation and his parent have sign guarantor agreement after their son death they discover that the guarantor agreement apply even in the event of his death and the let agent begin pursue they for the rent it be rent for tenancy that have not yet start and tenancy that he would never take up this be shockingly punitive act against parent who be already suffer the bad possible loss in extensive correspondence with the let agent on my constituent behalf it refuse to budge simply state that the rent be contractual obligation and although it be unfortunate my constituent be bind to its term be grateful to the minister for meet to discuss the issue raise by this case she have explain that the bill will enable any tenant to terminate tenancy with two month notice but two month rent be financial penalty that no bereaved guarantor should have to pay this type of clause be not in every guarantor agreement and it be not necessary insurance policy can cover loss of rent in the event of the death of tenant ask the government to reconsider their position and in committee to accept my amendment which would straightforwardly outlaw the pursuit of guarantor for rent owe by deceased tenant and stop any other family have to suffer this egregious additional pain anxiety and hardship at time of great sadness and vulnerability listen to this debate be surprised that we be be accuse of dither and delay when year of labour government never produce bill such as this however that be for labour members to discuss and to wrestle with on their own term welcome the bill and support its sentiment but as with all piece of legislation that pass through this place the devil be in the detail the minister and the secretary of state have trifecta on their hand they must reassure member in this place and in the house of lords reassure tenant and reassure landlord because at the moment be not entirely sure that we be there just as not all tenant be bad tenant not all landlord be bad landlord we must make sure that what we provide in the bill today in committee and on third reading will reassure both tenant and landlord and take they with we as many member have say it be balance act of ensure the right of property ownership along with the right of good firm tenancy have three area on which to focus my remark the first be the removal of fix term follow the brilliant speech of my hon friend the member for cheadle mary robinson shall also mention the unforeseen consequence which she talk about perhaps can give an example my constituency have one of the large second home and airbnb market in the country under the government proposal that tenant will be able to hand back tenancy with minimum of two month notice someone could come down pretend that they be go to rent house on the long term rental market go there for june july and august and then hand back the tenancy with this clause we would completely obliterate the long term rental market because people would take advantage of it as short term let market and then hand the property back the disparity in price between the short term let market and the long term let market be unbelievably significant in south devon hope that the minister can reassure on that point because that be exactly what people will do they will rent house on the pretence that they will stay in it for significant period they will be there for the summer and then they will give it back that be what the clause allow we have to ensure that the unforeseen consequence be address unless the minister can give some reassurance worry deeply about what the long term rental market will look like at the moment across south devon only home be available for people to rent we do not demonise landlord without risk we need to incentivise people to put their house into the long term rental market so that they can provide that social value that be exactly why the country land and business association have say that it think that the rural private housing sector be set to shrink with of landlord either sell their property or change its usage class my second point be about court reform be distinctly uneasy about vote for bill that do not come with enforcement and arbitration measure we have be here before it be all very well to give brilliant speech in this place and clip it and put it on youtube or instagram but if we do not address the legal mechanism that be need to enforce the measure we do our constituent disservice it be part of the process in this place and it worry that the government be suggest that we vote blindly on piece of legislation that do not have that enforcement mechanism in it as have say the devil be in the detail so perhaps the minister could tell we what the timeline will be for the full creation of the court system or arbitration system how quickly will we see judgment come along how will we look to expand the wording on antisocial behaviour and what will the actual terminology be when consider bill few year ago we have very vague term for the acceptable level of noise the people who have to enforce that be the police if we do not have specific in our law they end up be interpret sometimes for the well but more often for the bad again ask the government to be clear about their law and language so that we can ensure that the bill be draft in the right way to help both tenant and landlord do not feel that this be particularly party political or that many people from across the house would disagree with those point it be about have good law and good legislation and we be all part of that system my third point be about the social value of landlord both the shadow minister and the secretary of state make exactly the same point they express the value of landlord in the housing mix we have to remember that because without landlord out there provide house our housing market would be lot bad off we therefore also have to ensure that under the right of property ownership which this place have protect over the year in many different form we be clear about the ground for eviction do not think that it be controversial to ask for eviction on the basis of breach of contract persistent late payment or damage to property we have to be clear about those thing no member who have speak in the debate which have be broadly co operative want people to be homeless or to live in bad housing but we have to be absolutely clear about what we be ask of tenant and landlord we have to provide reassurance and ensure that we be incentivise the long term rental market by the way we could also look at reinstitute section mortgage rate relief but that may be debate for another time we have to ensure that we be not push house back into short term let that we be create transparent legal system and that we be look after the value of tenant and landlord in equal measure as say at the beginning this framework be welcome but unfortunately there be more work to be do like my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts begin by inform the house that be vice president of the local government association be also parliamentary ambassador for pricedout the campaign for affordable housing let we give credit where it be due the government deserve praise for bring the bill forward at last it have the potential to be transformational bring renter much need additional security however if as the government statement on friday seem to suggest ministers be plan to delay indefinitely introduce the ban on section eviction the bill will be huge miss opportunity regardless of that issue if the bill be to reach its full potential it must be strengthen significantly and its many outstanding loophole must be firmly closed one such area of concern be notice period as we have hear the bill retain two month notice period when tenant receive an eviction notice on the ground of landlord need but with rent at their high level since record begin and housing in chronically short supply it be as shelter have argue almost impossible for many tenant to find suitable property to move into in just eight short week we must also remember in this debate that accord to the charity crisis the loss of private tenancy be the lead cause of homelessness in the uk short notice period along of course with no fault eviction contribute to that result in disastrous situation for the individual involve and huge expense for the taxpayer hope to hear from the minister why she believe that two month be enough time for tenant to relocate in such difficult housing market turn to fault base eviction have significant concern which hope can be address during the passage of the bill one be ground which as it stand propose widen the definition of antisocial behaviour to cover any behaviour capable of cause nuisance or annoyance mr deputy speaker every member of this house have the capability to cause nuisance or annoyance and many of we do it frequently in this chamber how on earth could we stop rogue landlord from exploit such an extremely broad definition they could make false claim about tenant capacity to cause antisocial behaviour and evict they simply to hike up the rent protection must be build into the system to avoid section eviction through the back door what safeguard be in place specifically to stop victim of domestic abuse from face eviction on antisocial behaviour ground do we really want those who suffer at the hand of their abuser to lose their home as well there be much work to be do in this area another reason for fault base eviction of course be rent arrear again no one deny that such eviction can be reasonable in certain circumstance but safeguard for the vulnerable be vital and sensible balance be need ground mean that someone need to have be in two month worth of rent arrear for just one day on three occasion to be liable for eviction as we all know from our own casework rent arrear can arise for variety of reason unexpected bill illness redundancy in cost of living crisis tenant could well find themselves fall foul of ground through no fault of their own will be interested to hear from the minister what assessment the government have make of the impact of make ground eviction discretionary rather than mandatory so that as in scotland the case would come before judge who could evaluate whether the eviction be justify or resolution between landlord and tenant could be find that could help someone to stay in their home protect they from the devastation of homelessness the headline measure of the bill should be the long overdue ban on section but delay in the court system will hold up that important measure for some time none the less other potentially positive step include the propose introduction of private rent sector ombudsman and property portal to which landlord must be sign up crucial to the effectiveness of those measure be the capacity of local authority to enforce they that be significant concern give the cut to local authority budget since and the resultant hollowing out of non statutory service that be not the only area in which the capacity of local authority be significant worry the local government association have raise specific concern about local authority ability to enforce compliance with the ban on landlord re let or remarkete their property within three month of use landlord need eviction ground as it appear in practice that that system would be wholly reliant on former tenant notice that the property be back on the market after they have be evict many landlord will surely chance their arm in that situation and put their property back on the market within the re let period so encourage the minister to consider whether that period should be long and what step she might take to ensure that such period be effectively monitor without tenant and former tenant have to put their head above the parapet and report landlord who fail to comply with the law notice period fault base eviction the use of ground the rigidity of ground there be much work still to do on the bill support it in principle but hope there be significant movement in committee let first refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and declare that be the co chair of the all party parliamentary group for renter and rental reform and be support by generation rent it be almost hard to believe that the word ban on no fault eviction will not be in the next tory party manifesto those word have be in queen speeches the tories have promise but they have not deliver now we know of course that that be because there be an almighty fight on the conservative benches fight that be still go on by the sound of it to all the dodgy landlord and vested interest watch this debate say that if they delay the bill and its implementation far as have be rumour today the result will be rental reform at the very core of the next general election campaign and when labour be in government legislation might well go even far beyond what some of those vest interest want enough about the politic let we get down to the bill itself central to this legislation be the abolition of section no fault eviction which have be the blight of renter for many year the aim be to provide safe home that allow renter to establish root in the community and start family that be lack at the moment be concern however that the vastly expand ground for eviction might undermine the very concept of the bill under schedule ground and remain no fault clause they be for the landlord move themselves in or sell to prevent potential abuse of those ground it be crucial that landlord provide unequivocal evidence of their intention include through solicitor agent letter or swear statement to the court after use those ground landlord should submit another statement within week of possession for example landlord who genuinely need to possess under those ground have nothing to lose in make such legal declaration and the clause be useless without they there may be legitimate circumstance in which ground be no long relevant someone might have be evict but the landlord no long want to sell the property or have family member move in for example should that happen reasonable compensation should be offer to the person who have be evict it be not fair to use the ground and then say whoopsie daisy do realise that could sell there must be redress for the tenant who have be harm ground allow for an eviction when the landlord be find to be at fault although do not think that people who be unfit to be landlord should remain landlord this ground penalise the tenant by discourage they from co operate with enforcement action as such we need either compensation for any no fault eviction or an administrative mechanism that keep the tenant in the property but remove the landlord day to day control for as long as that tenant wish to remain ground and deal with tenant who be in arrear while there be some protection for universal credit payment there be no protection where the arrear be irregular under ground arrear might be repeat but very short and the domestic abuse housing alliance have highlight the risk that this pose to victim of domestic abuse the court need to have discretion these clause can not be mandatory lastly ground be one have raise with the minister we need to ensure that antisocial behaviour be not an excuse for section eviction by the back door equally the idea of student eviction clause be very worrying the national union of students do not support it and do not see how it could be practically enforce would want to see that idea flesh out in committee or pledge that it will be ditch welcome the government inclusion of two method of enforcement the first be local government the second which be more encouraging be the ombudsperson be pleased that the secretary of state have agree to look at merge the ombudsperson we have too many at the moment but we need to make sure that that ombudsperson have the authority to rectify matter in timely manner one that still allow people to go to the court if they wish to pursue that method of redress it trouble that the landlord notice period have not be change from two month in my view that notice period should be four month and importantly tenant should have the flexibility to move out during notice period if tenant be give notice and move out the next week they should not be liable for two month worth of rent that seem wrong to turn to protection period tenant will have protection from eviction for the first six month of their tenancy currently they have six month after they sign each new assure shorthold tenancy mean that long term tenant might have few protection than they do at the moment renter need to be protect one proposal be to give they two year protection which be very good idea that we should explore in committee on rent increase we must ensure that we do not face wave of economic eviction otherwise what will happen be that the landlord will whack up the rent and someone will have to move the rental tribunal decision be tie to market mean that an increase will be consider valid if the final rent align with market rate in local area that be clearly unaffordable for the lha rate which be under remind colleague that in that rate be it have be decrease year after year and we need to address that the bill be also in danger of fail to address the no dss benefit discrimination and the rampant guarantor discrimination that happen all the time in the rental sector as well as affordability check which be use as method of economic discrimination those problem also need to be address in the bill be fan of the theory behind the property portal but fear that it might end up be like the bad landlord list which never really work and be never enforce appreciate that there be fine for not register property but those fine should be pay to the tenant as be the case with the deposit protection scheme that would encourage tenant to make sure that their landlord be register they would receive recompense if the landlord be not we can not have local authority do all the checking they just do not have the resource at the moment we need everyone to be able to support these reform my co chair of the appg on this subject be make some very important point could he far develop the important principle of the tenant be compensate for some of the no fault or other fine that he have mention would love to but we do not have much time however there need to be some discussion about what compensation someone will be give if they be no fault evicted for example should they be give two month compensation which could pay for deposit and the first month rent in their new property if the landlord have not register and the tenant be then evict because their landlord have fail to be good landlord which be of course one of the ground what compensation will that person receive enable they to move into new decent accommodation their money be tie up in the deposit and in have pay the rent there need to be some serious thought about how we compensate tenant so that they can move on in the private rent sector some people have also say that the property portal might be back door way of get rid of selective licencing which would be great mistake the real story of these reform method be the work of ten of thousand of hard work activist advice worker policy leader and organisation up and down this country many of they in the renters reform coalition to which give much praise we be close to significant reform but we must be vigilant never day go by without constituent or more than one constituent contact about problem they be have with their housing in particular my caseworker and have be startle in recent month by the number of people come to we who have be serve with section notice will give just one example be contact just few week ago by family in my constituency who have be serve both section notice and section notice of increase the rent the son in the family have epilepsy asthma and autism and he attend local school where he have an education health and care plan in place the family can not afford private rent but with the social housing stock under so much pressure they be terrify they would not find home close enough to his school and to much need family support many of my other constituent story reflect this one family with disabled member who be distraught at lose their home to landlord who be put up the rent make they beyond their reach these be just some of the household that have be unfairly evict since the government first promise that they would take forward this legislation how many more of my constituent will be serve section notice before this legislation not only get on to the statute book but become effective with the reform to the justice system and the court have have so many constituent write to ask we to press for this bill to come forward but fear we will not have meet their expectation and their hope for the protection of tenant in the future particularly in relation to section there be no doubt that pass the bill into law will be vital step forward but it need to be effective as well so the issue about the court need to be resolve as matter of urgency and hope that the minister will address those in her closing comment have some other serious reservation about how some of provision will work in practice just on the issue of section eviction the new ground for landlord to reclaim possession make it clear that they will be ban from re let their property only for three month after evict tenant the kind of rent increase we be see today may well mean that repossession be still well worth it for landlord be afraid furthermore many of the family that come to after receive section notice be currently able to receive priority assistance from the council due to their risk of homelessness but this bill appear to remove the right to immediate help if family be serve with possession notice in the absence of section we desperately need this right to assistance to be reinstate as the bill pass through its many stage move away from the specific issue of no fault eviction be concern about the government turn on the promise they make in the white paper to introduce requirement that privately rent home meet the decent home standard there be some discussion of this in the opening statement but would like further assurance from the minister in her closing remark that the issue of decent standard which be so much need in private rent housing will be urgently address and bring forward in this bill early this year hear from constituent renting from private landlord who be leave without cooker for three month of his tenancy as well as have ongoing issue with his boiler and with rise damp all of which he have attempt to take up with his landlord we of course take up these issue locally to try to resolve the problem in fact he leave the property before they be resolve leave the problem for the next tenant as understand it however at my constituent request write to the department on august to ask what be be do to stop private landlord from leave family in home that be not up to standard so he be sufficiently concern to see this as policy issue not just an issue for himself unless council be give great enforcement power to tackle wide range of standard breach and the resource to deal with those in practical term be concerned that renter such as my constituent will not be protect from landlord who fail to fulfil their responsibility my constituent have also be write to about pet and it be positive that there will be right to request to have pet hope that during the passage of the bill we can define the phrase unreasonably refuse or fear that too many renter will find it to be right in name but not in practice the provision in the bill be desperately need by my constituent and those of all hon member urge the government to end the dithering and delay in enable this bill over the past five year also hope they will take the further step that so many member have identify and that be require to protect our constituent from homelessness and poor quality housing it be about time it be nearly five year since promise be first make to tenant face soar rent huge energy bill cold and damp home and limited right we be now on our housing minister since and the government be fast run out of time to make good on the promise in the bill unforgivably late though it be the bill be important and provide genuine opportunity to move towards the most basic goal of create fair green home it be clear that the market have become over commodifie and grossly distort we have generation who will never be able to earn enough to have mortgage and can not even afford their rent now key worker be be force out of the place they work in family uproot child force to move school revenge eviction for those who complain the list go on more people be become homeless follow rise eviction from the private rent sector annual government figure release recently show increase in people at risk of homelessness because of section no fault eviction welcome this delayed but essential bill not least because brighton and hove be one of the most expensive city to rent in outside london with large proportion of renter be rip off on long term basis with no end in sight recent analysis show that in our city rent have jump by since and wage have rise by to put that another way since renter in brighton and hove pay million more to landlord than if housing cost have match wage there be some good principle and useful change in the bill such as measure on security of tenure new ombudsman and so on but there be also glare loophole and big omission in particular the measure on rent increase be inadequate and rely on resource intensive and time consume appeal process that could see tenant bad off at the end of it as the tribunal process include power to impose high rent than the one the tenant be appeal at the very least that power need to be remove indeed ministers need to go far and get to grip with the fact that many people simply can not afford their rent as it stand many of my constituent be pay massively more than of their gross monthly income on housing cost that be unsustainable and we need conversation about national system for rent control with local flexibility such system will need to be both bold and implement gradually and fairly introduce alongside suite of policy to address the housing crisis include major increase in social house building and real support for community lead housing as well as tackle demand and sky high rent deal with insecurity of tenure be vital so it be right that the bill contain measure for periodic tenancy and to ban section no fault eviction and that student in the general prs be also include as many have say it be deeply concern that last friday the government appear to have kick that part of the bill down the road who know how long say that they first need to fix the mess that they have make of the court delay we need to know exactly when we can expect that part of the bill to come back even before last friday attack on the section provision there have be noise about possible government amendment to exclude student from the reform remind the secretary of state of his own white paper in which he say it be important that student have the same opportunity to live in secure home and challenge poor standard as other in the prs well agree with that as well as ensure that student remain include we need to firmly shut another glare loophole in the no fault eviction ban in the bill if landlord seek to sell or to move in themselves they can issue no fault eviction notice and the no let period after they use that exemption be just three month that be too short and could easily be abuse for example landlord could evict tenant by say they want to move in and re let just week later that no let period should be nearer month good landlord genuinely use these exemption would have nothing to fear from that welcome the proposal for the portal although would like to see far more issue cover on it that portal have real potential to improve enforcement of energy efficiency standard and to ensure warm and dry home be dismay when the prime minister announce last month that he would be scrap the update minimum energy efficiency standard for private rent home under the pretext of save people from expensive upgrade it be not hard press tenant and family who will be require to upgrade their home but the landlord who would no long be allow to rent out cold and inefficient home private renter live in some of the leaky home in the uk with more than quarter of household live in fuel poverty as the climate change committee have observe these regulation would have cut energy bill significantly by around year on average at current price minister need to stop this false dichotomy between climate action on the one hand and cost on the other and admit that in cut our emission we can also deliver warm and more comfortable home the government need to bring forward an amendment in committee to require all privately rent home to be energy performance certificate grade by at the late finally we know that the uk inadequate housing stock be erode not only people budget but their health and wellbeing the death of two year old awaab ishak in as result of prolonged exposure to mould in his home environment be terrible tragedy and an utter scandal in the social housing sector it be frankly shocking that the decent home standard still do not apply to private rent home with the government admit that almost one in four of those home in the private rent sector would not meet this most basic standard the vague commitment for jam tomorrow while child breathe in dangerous mould today be simply not good enough it be not good enough for the mum in brighton who email to say that her daughter have be cough for two month because of the leaky unsafe insecure flat that she be desperate to leave it be not good enough for my constituent who be ill from long term exposure to mould live with wall that be dripping wet and permanent cough or those whose rented accommodation be so bad that it be recently film by the bbc for their rip off britain feature again and again in my constituency casework hear about landlord who blame tenant for the problem cause by structural issue that the landlord have themselves ignore such as the landlord who keep one family deposit to pay for mould removal and redecoration that be frankly outrageous will ministers give we timeframe for decent home legislation and confirm that it will be in the king speech next month will they explain how the government can possibly justify fail to ensure that all landlord be compel to act on health hazard such as damp and mould in timely manner will they act with urgency to apply awaab law to the private rent sector the right of renter be one of the big issue in putney southfields and roehampton where the average rent for bedroom flat be month that be nearly year have safe secure and affordable private rental property be vital for londoners but the current break system leave too many renter insecure and powerless if they have an unscrupulous landlord for too long there have be power imbalance in favour of landlord over tenant which be abuse by bad landlord and the government have do nothing to fix that this market failure affect teacher nurse doctor police and prison officer that have speak to they find it very hard to live in south west london under the current rental market which make it hard to recruit into our public service the effect of this market failure be spill out into all part of our life thank the london renters union generation rent shelter crisis and the renters reform coalition for their tireless campaign work to stand up for renter it be appal that it have take so long to bring in this bill since the government first announce that they would take this legislation forward people in household have be unfairly evict and threaten with homelessness because of the government delay welcome the measure in the bill that believe will make real difference to renter and start to fix the broken system welcome end all fix term tenancy and replace they with periodic open end tenancy the creation of an ombudsman that all private landlord must join the property portal database to well inform landlord and tenant the duty to provide information to tenant and the right to request pet the most british of right but what want to see most of all be the end of section no fault eviction which be use by bad landlord to kick out tenant who ask for repair or to hike up rent unjustifiably be kick out of my own accommodation by landlord who say he be go to sell off the property after huge upheaval drive past couple of month later to see that he have rent it out to different tenant recent research from citizens advice find that shocking of those who complain about their condition receive section notice within six month that remind of family whose door knock on who be move out they say goodbye we be move out of the area their father who be clear out the house with they say he be absolutely furious they be policeman and nurse and they have to leave our area because they have complain about the poor state of repair of their house and have be serve with section think of another family with child age six and who have spend the past four year in flat that have be damaging to their health suffer from structural damage deep rooted mould and grow mouse infestation they ask their landlord to carry out essential repair and be serve with section notice in return one of my constituent be serve with section no fault eviction notice on their house single parent to two vulnerable child with additional need whom she have adopt from care after be remove from situation of domestic abuse she could not afford to rent any other private property on her single income as she find they to be far too expensive she have be leave to join the council waiting list and be render homeless be that not exactly why we need to deal with this issue in the bill we absolutely do very much welcome that intervention we all have so many story and know so many family for whom the bill and end section eviction would make an enormous difference it would also make for more level playing field for those good landlord who be do the right thing be therefore appal that the secretary of state be potentially pull the rug from under the bill by say that no fault eviction can only be end once the court be reform that be conservative failure in the justice system compound conservative failure in housing who lose out it be hard work rent pay british people urge the minister to give clear timetable for put those legal reform in place so that the can be not just kick down the road while be pleased that the bill set out new strict ground for eviction remain concerned that it do not go far or fast enough first the bill have take too long the government must speed up its delivery about londoners face no fault eviction each week so every six month of delay in the bill will mean another more londoners will face no fault eviction we do not have time secondly there should be requirement that private rent home meet the decent home standard have be call for minister for mould for long time thirdly provision to increase council investigative and enforcement power be necessary there need to be fund for that as well otherwise we be shift the problem from national to local government which will need to shift around its resource and take funding from other area fourthly there be loophole that must be close otherwise section could just continue by another name unscrupulous landlord could game the system and exploit the new ground to sell an occupied property so it be vital that high level of evidence be require to demonstrate the intention to sell or occupy property the change to discretionary ground from likely to capable of cause antisocial behaviour be open to so many vary interpretation that it will lead to inconsistent unfair application so it will not be the game changer in get rid of antisocial behaviour that it could be finally prevent homelessness by preserve the private renter right to access to homelessness assistance from their council as soon as possession notice be serve would be an essential addition to the bill the bill be first step that only scratch the surface of what be need to fix the housing emergency that the conservatives have create mortgage bill and rent be soar few people be able to buy their own home and more than million people be stick on social housing waiting list compound by the threat of no fault eviction be they to move into the private rent sector more home must be build while the government have promise rebalancing of the relationship between tenant and landlord unless we see several amendment the current crisis look set to continue the bill be good launching point but labour would significantly strengthen protection for private renter beyond its scope so that good landlord can be assure of be on level playing field bad landlord will stop misuse their power and tenant will finally be able to get the long term security right and condition that they deserve call the ever patient john mcdonnell as the hon member for strangford jim shannon and know always be call last mean that we have the enjoyment of listen to the whole debate today debate have be extremely valuable across the house go into forensic detail on the bill want to make plea for urgency that be all welcome the inclusion of this issue in the conservative manifesto in fact congratulate my then constituency neighbour the right hon member for uxbridge on bring it forward also accuse he of plagiarism because it be in our last two labour manifesto congratulate he because as many have report today my constituent be in housing crisis most of the council housing have be sell off to go on the housing waiting list they must have live in the area for year and they have to prove that with documentation which many people can not once on the housing waiting list they will wait between three and five maybe seven year their child will have grow up by then four thousand new property be be build in the middle of my constituency but there be barely any that my constituent will be able to afford because the price be so high and the wage in my constituency despite high employment level be relatively low since rent have go up on average by three time the rate of wage increase in london alone rent over the last year be up on average in some area they be up to basically that mean that people struggle to get roof over their head whether from the council or rent and certainly struggle for owner occupation do not know any firefighter teacher or nhs worker in my constituency who live there any more they commute for mile because they can not afford accommodation in the constituency people live in my constituency in slum condition damp cold unsafe and mouldy as we hear from my hon friend the member for putney fleur anderson have the phenomenon of bed in shed in my office we have moral dilemma about whether we tell the council that someone be live in shed because we know that if we do enforcement come in and that person be then homeless with nowhere to go whatsoever as have be say throughout the debate as soon as people complain about the condition or rent the landlord bring in section that be why it be right for the conservatives to include the bill in their last manifesto and welcome it landlord always use the excuse that they be move in relative we would need genetic link mapping to identify the relationship between some of the tenant who move in and the family landlord might say that they be sell the property but as have be say when we tour around we see that in fact they have not within day the to let board go up they scam we all the time my constituent live in fear of complain at all because they know that if they do many of they will lose their property it be correct that the majority of landlord be good but it be the rogue landlord that fear the bill do not address do the right hon gentleman accept that in london part of the problem be that the amount of rental property available for new renter on the market be down it be important to encourage good landlord as he talk about to have long rental period should we incentivise they to do that through thing such as tax break look the major problem be that we be not build enough council house on the conservative benches couple of member refer to harold macmillan harold macmillan take on from clem attlee huge housing programme and build council house my family be beneficiary of that we move out of slum and into council house we just need to build more council house we can not rely on the private market because it profiteer in my constituency landlord can make profit by leave the property empty because the price will always go up and sometimes they do not want to be encumber by tenancy when tenant complain they get kick out and be make homeless in my constituency people have be push all around the country have people live in travelodge in slough they have to bring their child into hayes each day which take an hour and half then there be temporary accommodation with poor condition and hostel we have child be bring up in temporary accommodation look at the figure child be now live in temporary accommodation fully support the bill get rid of section but the problem be exactly as my hon friend the member for blaydon liz twist say the sanction and condition will render it totally ineffective landlord will simply take three month hit and then rent it out straight after that and to rely on the court system we have to be honest with one another the government have close county court there be cut of in the justice budget over the last period in addition if we be look to local authority to enforce nearly local authority be under section notice in other word they be bankrupt and do not have the staff to do the enforcement to be frank in many area now the lack of access to basic legal advice not legal aid but basic legal advice from local law centre be non existent my citizen advice bureau bless it work so hard but it be rush off its foot so it can not provide sufficient advice on the scale that be need my plea be for urgency we have have really good debate forensic analysis of the bill the detail and the beneficial element but also the gap and the need for change and amendment hope the committee will on report bring back significantly amend bill that will scrap section that be what both party promise in our manifesto at the last election and believe that other political party do exactly the same there be unanimity in this house to scrap section but we must do it with sense of urgency and we must do it effectively call the opposition bench spokesman it be pleasure to close this second reading debate for the opposition and thank all hon and right hon member who have speak in it it have be good debate and one define by great many thoughtful and eloquent contribution as my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner so rightly argue in her remark at the outset this be piece of legislation that be shamefully overdue as she and other speaker point out not only be it now over four and half year since the government first pledge to abolish section no fault eviction but for reason that now appear quite clear ministers sit on the bill for further five month subsequent to its publication in may draw attention to the lengthy delay in bring the bill forward be not simply parliamentary debating point as many of my hon friend include my hon friend the members for putney fleur anderson for liverpool riverside kim johnson for liverpool west derby ian byrne and for blaydon liz twist point out it have have very real consequence for private renter across the country during the year that ministers prevaricate and the month this year they clearly spend negotiate with the discontented on their own benches ten of thousand of renter have be push to financial breaking point by multiple rent rise or threaten with homelessness as result of be serve section notice we will continue to justifiably bemoan the fact that the government have not act with the urgency that be require but we do welcome the bill finally progress want to take the opportunity to thank once again on behalf of those on the labour benches all organisation particularly the that comprise the renters reform coalition for not only make the case for change over many year but for join labour over recent month in urge ministers to get on with the process of turn the bill into law the case for fundamentally reform the private rented sector be as watertight as they come and labour have call for it for many year more than million people in england not just the young and the mobile but now many old people and family with child live day in day out with the knowledge that they could be uproot from their home with little notice and minimal justification and significant minority of they be force to live in substandard property for fear that complaint would lead to an instant retaliatory eviction such situation can not possibly be justify the sector should have be transform long time ago its regulation should have be overhaul to level the play field between landlord and tenant decisively the bill be good starting point to that end and as the debate have make clear the principle of it enjoy broad support across the house general support have be express today for the white paper proposal that have find their way into it include new property portal and ombudsman simple tenancy structure the end of rent review clause prohibition on multiple in year rent increase the right to request keep pet and of course the abolition of section notice however as nearly all opposition members mention significant degree of uncertainty now surround the implementation of the promise section abolition as result of concession make by minister to appease minority of disgruntle conservative members seemingly without complete success give the tone and content of the contribution of the right hon member for calder valley craig whittaker and for gainsborough sir edward leigh and the hon member for yeovil mr fysh and for don valley nick fletcher as we have hear the government have make it clear in recent day although it would seem that member be tell two week ago that section notice will not be phase out until ministers judge that sufficient progress have be make to improve the court explicit reference be make to end to end digitisation of the process which could well take great many year to achieve private renter across the country who have be assure repeatedly by ministers that the passage of this bill will finally remove the threat of section eviction have no guarantee whatsoever that the concession make do not amount to an effective deferral of that change well beyond the phase transition already provide for by the bill if this sound all too familiar that be because it be the secretary of state have form when it come to acquiesce in damage concession rather than face down the unruly benches behind he with future housing supply in england notable past casualty after year of tory government the court system be on its knee the government have have more than four and half year since they commit themselves to abolish section eviction to make significant improvement to it in order to support good faith landlord and they have not succeed as thing stand hmcts do not expect to be able to deliver even the reduce scope reform programme to its current timetable give this government record why on earth should renter take it on trust that thing will improve markedly any time soon the inefficiency of the court system be huge problem and action must be take to address its lack of capacity so that landlord possession claim can be expedite but the end of no fault eviction can not be make dependent on an unspecified degree of future progress subjectively determine by ministers in the absence of very clear commitment from the minister on metric and timeline in this respect we will seek to amend the bill in committee to ensure that it be not while ministers face the prospect of have to give further ground as the bill progress to keep their back benchers onside labour will work in committee to see it strengthen so that it truly deliver for tenant we will press for clarification of the new ground for possession for student landlord to ensure that they be not too expansive and will probe the government intention in respect of deal with the complexity of the student market my hon friend the member for sheffield central paul blomfield and the chair of the select committee my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts rightly call for that we will put forward number of sensible change include an increase in the propose notice period from two month to four month to protect renter well be pleased that my hon friend the members for stretford and urmston andrew western and for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle argue for that we will press the government to reconsider their position on range of white paper proposal that do not make it into the bill they include measure to strengthen council enforcement power thank my hon friend the members for battersea marsha de cordova and for blaydon for raise that point along with power to limit the amount of advance rent that landlord can ask for and provision to expand rent repayment order to cover repayment for non decent home we will explore why essential reform that be outline in the white paper include the propose legally bind decent home standard and the propose ban on landlord refuse to rent to those in receipt of benefit or with child point powerfully make by my hon friend the member for sheffield south east be not on the face of the bill we will explore what more might be do to ensure that the separate measure that have be promise to enact each of those reform be pass and apply quickly and effectively we will also look to amend various provision in the bill relate to new and revised ground for possession include the far too sweeping and punitive propose new mandatory ground and the propose change to discretionary ground relate to antisocial behaviour so that blameless and vulnerable tenant be properly safeguard perhaps most importantly we will seek to close the numerous loophole in the bill that would allow the minority of disreputable landlord such as the unscrupulous owner of dorchester court mention in the powerful contribution of my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes to exploit tenant and jeopardise their security of tenure let we take two example that be feature prominently in the bill even with the propose expand right to challenge it be far from clear that the tribunal system would prevent significant number of tenant from be evict by mean of an extortionate rent hike we need to explore what more can be do to put in place genuinely effective mean of redress for they similarly the propose three month ban on landlord re let property they have take back to sell or move into themselves be not only insufficient but appear not to apply in some circumstance and will almost certainly be impossible to enforce even when it do we need to tighten it the bill be shamefully overdue but imperative we support it in principle and be pleased that it will progress today but it need to be enhance rather than undermine by concession aim at placate minority of member private renter deserve piece of legislation that will ensure that they have real security and enjoy well right and condition in short order we be willing to work constructively with the government on the bill but make no mistake we plan to do everything in our power to see it strengthen to the benefit of private renter who have wait long enough for meaningful change it be huge pleasure to deliver the closing speech today on the second reading of the government renters reform bill and begin by thank member across the house for their valuable thoughtful and knowledgeable contribution to the debate have enjoy and note the contribution from my hon friend the member for dover mrs elphicke the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts the chair of the select committee my right hon friend the member for calder valley craig whittaker the hon member for westminster north ms buck my hon friend the member for milton keynes north ben everitt whom thank for all his work across range of all party parliamentary group the hon member for liverpool riverside kim johnson my hon friend the member for cheadle mary robinson the hon member for sheffield central paul blomfield would be very happy to meet he and his appg and my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker who will know about all the work we be do to help address the second home issue in his constituency he have speak to about that on number of occasion also thank the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan for the support from the liberal democrat front bench declare an interest similar to that of my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh as have four child in their who be rent in london know at first hand of the issue that they and their friend face and that be why be so convinced that this bill be the right thing to do for the next generation of our child and grandchild the minister child be in their but we want to make sure that they be not in their before the bill actually come into effect so will she give we clear time when the court will be ready for the bill to be active in the government view will come on to that precise point if the hon member will allow want to thank the hon member for battersea marsha de cordova my hon friend the member for poole sir robert syms the hon member for liverpool west derby ian byrne and my hon friend the member for don valley nick fletcher whom will be happy to meet again as request also thank the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana my hon friend the member for guildford angela richardson and the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes be deeply concerned about the case she have raise with and will continue to work with she thank my hon friend the member for totnes anthony mangnall the hon member for stretford and urmston andrew western for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle for blaydon liz twist for brighton pavilion caroline lucas and for putney fleur anderson and the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell it be right to say at this point that we be commit to honour the manifesto commitment that we make in to create private rent sector that work for everyone and to level up housing quality in this country be grateful to all hon and right hon member who continue to engage constructively with we on the provision in the bill so that we can deliver the change need to create fairer rental market for both tenant and landlord of course echo the sentiment of my right hon friend the secretary of state who say in his opening remark that we will continue to work closely with member to further hone and refine this legislation as it be put on the statute book rise will make progress because have limit time and must address the point that have be put to first it be right that antisocial behaviour be discretionary ground judge must decide on the circumstance of case have formerly be minister with responsibility for safeguarding and domestic abuse completely understand the importance of take such serious issue into account and strike the right balance between tenant and landlord be ask whether local authority will have funding to carry out their enforcement duty of course they will have that new burden funding as they would with any government legislation be ask about blanket ban on benefit claimant and family with child and make it very clear that we be commit to outlaw the unacceptable practice of such blanket ban we be carefully consider how to get these measure right this be significant reform as think all member understand we must do it in the right way while ensure that landlord rightly have the final say on who they rent their property to will the minister give way will give way to member if have time but please allow to make my point there have be many question about the ombudsman we need simplicity and clarity for landlord and tenant it be important to say that this bill do not in itself establish new ombudsman an exist ombudsman could do the job and again we be look at that very carefully to make sure we get the right solution for this vital part of our regulatory reform be grateful that many member have welcome the point about pet and agree that we be nation of animal lover again this be about reasonableness my hon friend the member for cheadle be exactly right the circumstance she set out would constitute reasonable ground for refusal but we need to look carefully at how this work the decent home standard have be raise again and it be key part of our reform we must make sure that the new system we introduce mean people be live in decent safe and warm home everyone in this house will be under no illusion about how importantly this government take this issue as they can see the work that have be introduce by my right hon friend the secretary of state to tackle these issue which have lay unresolved for many year this government bring in groundbreake reform in the social rent sector and we will do so in the private rent sector to give tenant the same protection it be important to note at this point that the vast majority of possession claim do not end up in the court only something like of claim go through the court in my capacity as housing minister work closely with the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer who be responsible for his majesty courts and tribunals service there be wide range programme of reform in the court system the court have already make huge improvement it be worth say that over of hearing be list within four to eight week of receipt and of course the ombudsman will encourage the early dispute resolution process take lot of claim out of the court and free up court time for more complex process when we bring in this reform however it be right that we ensure landlord have confidence in the justice system because as everybody have point out if we do not have good landlord in this country who have confidence in the system that underpin the justice system we will not have the rent home in every constituency that our country need we have always commit to align and synchronise the reform of the private rent sector with the court system we note that that be recommendation of the levelling up housing and communities committee we do not think that housing court be the right way to do that nor be that the view of the sector or of the stakeholder with whom we have engage in huge detail this work remain priority for our department and for the ministry of justice we want to see landlord be offer digital process for possession on all ground if the bill second reading receive widespread support because it will rightly ditch no fault eviction of tenant without trigger an exodus of private sector landlord that will in no small part be down to the hard work for which be very grateful of ministers include my hon friend while she be look at what be reasonable speed to resolve antisocial behaviour claim in the court will she confirm that it be the government firm intention to fulfil our manifesto commitment and implement the bill as soon as possible thank my hon friend very much can absolutely give he that assurance do the minister accept that if the country land and business association estimate be correct that the bill may reduce the available private rental by in rural area that could have completely deleterious effect on the prime minister main pledge which be to get inflation down core inflation be drive by rental will the minister work with to fix the bill and ensure that that do not eventuate be very happy to work with my hon friend on this and many other issue but it be important that say that we have do considerable analysis there be no evidence such as the estimate that he have just point to that the bill will lead to landlord leave the sector but it be right that any policy that the government bring in be base on evidence that will always be our approach will the minister give way want to wind up now because can not detain the house any long assure right hon and hon member that we be focus on introduce this groundbreaking once in generation reform commend the bill to the house question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time renter

found chairman of the all party parliamentary group on environmental social and governance be delighted to have secure the first ever debate on environmental social and governance development in the uk in this place refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and to the all party group interest as well esg be set of characteristic that can be use to assess the non financial element of an investment or business decision in its simple form esg be way to take into account potential risk and reward that might not be obvious from balance sheet everyone in their own way incorporate esg criterion into each and every economic decision even if unknowingly for instance the property developer do not buy land next to crumble cliff family might choose not to go to particular shop because they have hear that it treat its employee badly or woman might change job to work for firm that be fight the gender pay gap esg be simply the use of non financial criterion in decision making way for investor company and individual to get big picture of the impact of their investment which will help they well understand the risk and more importantly the reward recently there have be much debate about esg as it have rise in prominence the number of esg asset under management have grow by more than since with global esg asset expect to exceed trillion or about four time the value of all the asset hold in the uk they will also account for third of all asset under management by this scale up have be meet with some concern about esg perhaps have some underlying political current this be wrong in its true form esg be simply an investment strategy one that like all investment strategy aspire to low risk and high return esg be not political stance way of life or mantra for investor although of course in some situation it be unfortunately use wrongly to pursue certain political agenda in other it be see as shorthand for ethical or impact investing however it be neither in this debate will be stick to our definition of esg as an investment strategy and hop to make the case to government for why we should be encourage it what problem we have to overcome and how good to claim the crown and the associated benefit as the world leader of esg invest commend the hon gentleman for secure this debate do he agree that if we create science base and world beat taxonomy business that can show alignment with the uk green taxonomy will automatically be in alignment with international taxonomy which should ensure that there be no divergence which should subsequently enhance our capacity do he far agree that government and the minister have role to play in assist business to achieve that potential so that all of we in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland can gain and everybody can be winner thank the hon member for intervene it be always pleasure when he join such debate he mention the minister who know have good keen personal interest in esg have work in the field prior to come to this place the hon member be completely right about the green taxonomy we need robust taxonomy will come to that later but it be shame that we be behind where we should be with the green taxonomy we need to be careful to ensure that our green taxonomy be robust and world lead one of the many benefit of leave the european union be that we can define what we want and how we want it ourselves by have uk green taxonomy we can ensure that we be world leader in the uk include in northern ireland especially which know have high level of financial service let go back to the meat of my speech it be not the case that those invest along esg line do not want to see good do for planet and people they do for example we know that esg investor be sometimes willing to pay high fee and to see low return than their more return focus peer the wall street journal report early this year that esg fund could charge up to three time more do not exclude those type of company and investor from this discussion rather in hold the first ever debate on esg in the house hope that more discourse will lead to more action it be clear that use non financial metric and thereby factor in all the datum available to make the most rational informed investment decision possible will lead to financial return for example more esg align employer will be able to hire well candidate for less something know as take green cut which be the attitude that up to of young people be recently report as take equally improve environmental rating through technology can lead to huge efficiency saving for company for example some study have show that use low energy lighting have payback of less than month which be win for the company bottom line and its sustainability standard this reflexive impact of esg be know as double materiality which be how business be affect by change condition be they climate social or governance and what that company be do to contribute to or militate against those change that be become more and more important for investor to factor in there be also huge financial benefit to be gain from embrace esg for the whole country include northern ireland the uk be already home to the old and most trust conventional financial centre that be couple with the city of london commitment to sustainability top the global green finance index therefore with little extra effect we will secure home for esg investor inside our border esg recent rise in popularity have cause some grow pain primarily the lack of universal framework and metric mean that trust in esg be at an all time low as we have see in anti esg proposal approve by board globally in esg investing as in all business trust be paramount just as an investor must be sure that their investment be sound and that they will not suddenly find themselves out of pocket an esg investor need to be sure that any claim to sustainability be true we have rich history of account for financial accuracy in this country with the domesday book perhaps be the early example in that case the new or relatively new king william check that his investment be as profitable as he have think that invasion of do not come cheap it take year and parliamentary select committee to develop something close to modern accountancy practice but the uk be now an oasis of bookkeeping and verifiable invest fraudulent financial claim can be easily spot and shut down why then be the same not the case for fraudulent esg claim one of the main cause of the problem be that much of what esg seek to account for be intangible and therefore incalculable with our current framework how for example might company begin to calculate its effect on biodiversity what metric can an investor look for to see an investment diversity score this problem be not insurmountable twenty year ago as major economy be wake up to the true effect of increase carbon emission and climate change the issue of how to count carbon seem similarly difficult today after much trial and error and leadership from the uk we can quickly and easily calculate the carbon footprint of any business person or product develop framework to help business understand quantify and account for non financial factor be difficult but very important proper framework be the first line of defence against full breakdown in trust in esg report and investing they will also help to stop so call greenwashing where product or investment be market as be more sustainable than it be despite the name this apply across all three esg objective such distrust be make bad by some esg adviser and rating agency whose business plan seem to depend on be able to sell five star esg rating to the high bidder without give any proof of they whatever veritable wild west of the esg world of course many of these business be do comprehensive evaluation of the product but give the difficulty that an investor would have in distinguish the good rating from the bad it be hardly the confidence inspire boost that they need know that the treasury be well aware of the concern and be pleased that there be consultation hold early this year on how good to introduce regulation on esg rating this be good and necessary step but we be in danger of win the battle but lose the war if we delay any far urge the minister to speed up this regulation as much as possible we can go far than regulation however and set up the framework we need to allow any investor or company to understand quickly and easily the esg impact of their investment taxonomy essentially classification of what be and what be not allow would do just that and the treasury plan to develop uk green taxonomy be exactly the right step this taxonomy as well as its social and governance cousin would clearly outline investment that be sustainable and therefore could be market as such and those that be not give that the eu version of green taxonomy be dead in the water it be bureaucratic nightmare that be no long fit for purpose we can make our own decision here we be lucky that thank to brexit we have be give the chance to design our own robust taxonomy one that could and should lead the world and entrench the uk as the true home of sustainable finance sadly we have see our taxonomy delay and delay and delay be pleased to see the uk green taxonomy mention in this year green finance strategy update but on the original timeline we should already be halfway through the legislative process by now motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now stephenson be not sure whether the hon gentleman be aware but one of the arcane practice be that because the adjournment debate start before we have to move the motion again at the hon gentleman have the floor thank you for that guidance mr deputy speaker and for explain some of the wonderful aspect of this house ask the minister whether he will ensure that investor have framework to separate the sustainable from the spurious and whether he will take this chance to outline the full timetable for the taxonomy he will have plenty of time to do so as we have more time for this adjournment debate look forward to full and detailed timeline of when we will get this taxonomy be willing for he to intervene now if he so wish clearly he do not perhaps another less discuss difficulty face esg be imbalance the heavy focus have be on environmental consideration as be the most important often at the cost of social and governance factor let refer to one recent example of the consequence of fail to take that holistic approach dame alison rose be clearly champion for socially sustainable business particularly around gender equality she be torchbearer for woman in business have smash the glass ceiling to become the first woman to lead major uk bank however despite her very strong credential in social sustainability and the progressive environmental policy of natwest group as whole under her leadership there be clear failure in governance when discuss customer private banking detail with journalist think that we all know the gentleman be refer to be sure that all member will agree that it be right that dame alison resign over that abject failure of governance but also know that many will join in express our disappointment that the further empowering of woman in business and entrepreneurship will suffer because of that failure of governance excel in one area do not absolve someone from indiscretion in other the and can not and should not be separate failure in one be failure in they all clear metric and framework both within each strand of esg and encompass all three element will allow for well reporting and therefore well understanding for investor and company that will in turn return the trust that esg have be lack it be easy to oversimplify the true impact of more datum and disclosure and we can not ignore the practical implication of such policy particularly on small business and individual investor since the turn of the millennium there have be increase in esg regulation alongside mile of other red tape in all shape and size the disclosure burden on investor and business be big than at any previous point lead to whole sector and team devote to audit every aspect of business the eu own research indicate that its disclosure requirement will cost large firm upwards of year in paperwork alone likewise the uk green taxonomy when it be eventually publish will join about other environmentally focus taxonomy across the globe each need different type of disclosure large company may be able to absorb that but it be potentially lethal issue for small and medium sized enterprise which make up of british business and have far more limited staffing and budgetary ability to process those type of disclosure in push for more comprehensive reporting framework we should not bury small business under pile of paperwork over the course of my time chair the all party parliamentary group have be delighted to meet many small business that want to integrate esg into their practice many of they however have express to their nerve about how to keep up with continually change regulatory landscape and the addition of further disclosure hang like dark cloud so how do we achieve well esg report without overburden business and perhaps more importantly for those business why should they engage in this space how do we make esg work for business rather than make business work for esg in this debate have mostly speak about esg as risk management tool that investor can use as part of their normal investment analysis there be however many upside for both business and the uk as whole have already outline how business might utilise esg to increase efficiency or improve its workforce for the uk as whole though sme be the perfect vehicle for public policy objective to be achieve without the need for public sector financing or burdensome legislation the all party parliamentary group late report on woman in business to be publish tomorrow be perhaps good example it be sad fact that woman be still under represent in business today that be not only social problem it also represent billion gap in our economy luckily as in other area the private sector be far ahead of policymaker here thank to private firm and independent group the uk have one of the high level of female representation on board in the world it be beat only by country that have legislate to force company to adhere to quota top down government can make serious stride but the home straight will always require we to rely on great british business we can not let they down esg add value to business but it can not become barrier many member will like have hear concern report about some company particularly those involve in defence be exclude from access to investment and capital on esg ground as the government defence command paper point out there be no contradiction between invest along esg principle and the defence industry have already speak about the concern anti esg movement much of it stem from the view that movement for divestment in such contentious business be because of political stance again argue that that be mischaracterisation of esg instead and like the government believe that esg allow investor to factor in the environmental social and governance impact of these firm into their decision make process and help firm to take action that will result in well return these factor should not be unduly take out of context for political reason government need to create an environment where business can disclose problem area without the fear of backlash so long as they be responsible good investor can be drive force behind company clean up their act we must continue to ensure that all business have access to the capital they need from reputable interested investor we have see continue protest as part of an environmental campaign call for business to divest away from oil and gas but that would actually be detrimental to the world overall climate ambition once contentious industry such as oil and gas defence tobacco or alcohol can no long rely on investment from large public company that be open and clear about their business ethos they will most likely leverage finance from less savoury investor it be in our interest to engage not divest and make sure that trust investor retain hand on the wheel of these industry to steer they to more sustainable and well future the issue be not just about handful of industry when face with challenge that may bring public and investor backlash all firm need to feel secure that they be able to disclose bad practice and work to rectify they rather than quietly divest of the malpractice will give one example the international labour organisation estimate that there be nearly million modern slave across the world today it be almost impossible therefore for any large company not to use modern slavery at some point in its supply chain as much as of worldwide cotton production stem from slave labour member in the chamber today could be wear slave manufacture clothing what should responsible clothing business do if it discover that it have be accidentally buy slavery produce good should it quietly switch supplier and hope that the next one do not have the same problem or should it work with the supply chain to end the practice of slavery divestment for fear of repercussion will not solve environmental social or governance problem and company should not be penalise for bring accidental wrongdoing to light make esg work for business require that they should be able to show investor what they be do to tackle poor business practice without fear that they will be leave without access to capital the framework we build must include room for transitional sustainability improvement allow investor and company to own up to their failing and work to improve they rather than divest and pass the problem along have outline why we should be encourage esg what problem we face in do so and how it can help business investor and the uk as whole we must now ask what real action we can take to achieve this have in this debate refer consistently to framework or metric which will give certainty and clarity but what form should they take any framework need to be credible useable and importantly international what be more we need to act quickly to ensure that the uk be the go to place for esg will the minister be sure to look into speed up the publication of framework and regulation design to restore trust in esg the importance of credibility in framework be confirm by the eu recent green taxonomy failure as member will know the eu decide to include natural gas in its green taxonomy effectively allow any product use energy derive from fossil fuel to claim it be green that be perhaps the most serious and egregious example of greenwashe and it completely undermine any pretence that the eu taxonomy can be rely upon to build the trust that have be so clear we need our own framework and certainly our own green taxonomy must not have the same problem can the minister assure that any framework will be science lead and that ensure trust will be key consideration in the design of those framework we may be delay in our green taxonomy so ours may not be the first but let we make it the good let we learn from the mistake make by other country so that the uk be the gold standard go far if the uk be to be the ultimate home for esg we need to create metric for esg criterion that be currently unquantifiable much of the work that have already take place have go into flesh out area with exist datum but in order to ensure that greenwashing can not happen across any element of esg we need to drive forward progress on create standardised metric for area such as biodiversity community impact management structure and so much more to ensure that the uk be truly world lead will the minister be sure to speak to his colleague at the department for environment food and rural affairs and the department for work and pensions to create cross governmental taskforce that will be able to create those type of framework usability be also vital as have mention particularly in reference to sme burden investor and business with extra regulation should not be the objective of any government let alone robust conservative government any framework must allow for company to disclose failure and work hard to redeem themselves company work to achieve well result should be what they be judge by rather than their failure to encourage business to use esg to their advantage along the line that have describe and so that the uk can leverage the firepower provide by our booming private sector will the minister ensure that make the uk an esg hub will not have negative impact on business and investor we must look after sme today supply chain employee and financial flow span the world it be our duty as policymaker to help british business and investor benefit from be part of the global economy when it come to esg that will mean work with the framework of our international partner and use our brexit freedom to design system that allow for international co operation the government signal early this year that we will be adopt wholesale the international financial reporting standard create by the international sustainability standards board be great start and will ensure that we remain international player but want we to be international leader especially as the eu will continue to build its own full disclosure system can the minister confirm that we will continue along this path whenever possible esg be not go away and the uk should not be concern about or discourage of it must again pay tribute to the government for already be proactive in create welcome environment for esg of which know the chancellor be already keen advocate but if we be to become the global home for esg we must move fast and do ever more hope that this place see many more debate on the topic and that we continue to open line of communication and inquiry on one of the fast grow sector across the uk as home for esg we have strong foundation but before we can fully welcome esg inside we must make sure that the structure be solid or it risk total collapse congratulate my hon friend the member for rother valley alexander stafford on secure the debate not least because amazingly it be the house first dedicated debate on this subject which be remarkable it will certainly not be the last know that he care great deal about this subject not only as the chair of the appg on esg but from his career he speak with great authority and knowledge of the subject and be grateful to he for the opportunity to set out the government position on the important issue that he raise my hon friend will be aware of our steadfast commitment enshrine in law to reach net zero greenhouse gas emission by the year we already lead the world on tackle climate change we have decarbonise fast than any other major economy since reduce our emission by nearly half while grow our economy by some two third renewable have go from less than of our electricity supply in to in the first quarter of this year which be fantastic progress however as the prime minister have say recently we will not stop there the chancellor have set out his view that the uk green industry be key to create growth across this united kingdom and our whole economy and the prime minister announcement have outline how the government be work to unblock key barrier to investment and decarbonisation grow the sustainable finance sector to support the transition to net zero be major priority for this government and in march we publish our green finance strategy the strategy set out the policy regulatory change and framework that we will be focus on and take forward in the next two to three year help business to have more certainty it include for example our commitment to deliver useful and usable uk green taxonomy an important evidence base classification tool that will clearly define what be mean by green so that the market know where to channel investment as the hon member for strangford jim shannon rightly highlight that supply of relevant and reliable information will help guide we all in financing activity that actually support our net zero and environmental objective while make clear where damaging greenwashing be take place business that claim to be deliver green outcome while do no such thing not only continue to damage our environment but damage our collective effort to reduce the impact on the natural world by undermine the effort of their competitor and the confidence of the public this be clearly something that we need to tackle the competition and markets authority have lead crackdown on greenwashe advertising the green taxonomy will go much far make it easy to test and verify claim across the board can tell my hon friend the member for rother valley that our next step towards deliver that taxonomy something that he have directly ask for be direct consultation as he would expect that consultation will take place this autumn ensure that we gain market view it be right that we do so as that will help build trust in the process and build on lesson learn in other part of the world be pleased that my hon friend be speak so passionately from the dispatch box about the importance of build up trust do he agree that if we get this wrong esg greenwashing could be the next payment protection insurance scandal something that everyone sign up for decade ago for which we be still pay the price even now if we get this wrong we will face huge financial disadvantage and penalty down the line so we must get the taxonomy right one of the reason why we be look at uk taxonomy and be clear that we want to introduce one be to ensure that there be great transparency and clarity for investor that when they buy an investment product they know what they be get one of the thing that have historically be lack in the market be an understanding of what fund manager mean by green so investor be put at disadvantage and at risk of not purchase what they believe to be green product we will see how that consultation go but assure my hon friend that it will take place this autumn on global scale the market for esg rating and datum be rapidly develop and they be increasingly rely on by investor to guide their decision making the growth of the integration of esg into the investment process be expect to continue across all jurisdiction however esg rating provider currently fall outside the regulatory perimeter this raise the risk of harm with unrated rating which often lack transparency direct capital flow towards some company and project and away from other we be therefore explore action to address these grow esg investment trend to ensure that this activity be robust and that it protect uk market and ultimately consumer alongside the update green finance strategy the treasury have publish consultation seek view for potential future regulatory scheme for esg rating provider the consultation close on june with response receive from industry and we be review those response to inform the next stage of our work any potential regulation would be align with recommendation make by the international organisation of security commissions on how esg datum and rating provider could improve their activity such as improve transparency and mitigate conflict of interest it would also seek to be align with other jurisdiction include those of japan singapore and the eu which be put forward initiative in this space more transparent esg rating would build confidence in these product and the wider sustainable investment market as investor would be well able to understand how their money be put to use since the uk be at the forefront of international effort on this issue we have the opportunity to shape the approach of other jurisdiction if they be to follow we it be incumbent on we to set good example so we must recognise and address where esg principle be misapply as my hon friend have point out we have see concern around banking raise recently we have be clear that as matter of public policy it be wrong to remove someone bank account simply because of their political view free speech and the legitimate expression of differ view be essential british principle just as much as be esg let conclude by say that hope that in the time have be give and in the time we have listen to my hon friend he and other hon member can now appreciate that this country have build sustainable finance market product set and industry of which we should all be proud we be one of the world great democracy country that advocate for the fair and considerate treatment of the environment and the people of this world and one that practise what it preach we be determined to carry that on make conscientious decision that work for our country support our finance industry to play an important role in our economy and of course in society question put and agree to house adjourn
