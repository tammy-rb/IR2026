thank and pay tribute to my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton who bring the debate to the house this evening all hon member will agree that her passion and commitment to her constituency and this subject shine through can only say what an absolute honour it be to visit her constituency to discuss the work of the north birmingham economic recovery board will come shortly to the situation in birmingham and the approach that my hon friend recommend that the government take hope that her remark at the end of her speech on the purpose of politic and the role we all must play in give everybody chance and an opportunity in our society would be support across the house but she make the case well for that approach and so to birmingham this debate be important for many reason not least because some part of our country suffer much bad than other with poor employment outcome the government be commit to move towards our goal of an employment rate though some place in our country be already there unfortunately that be not the case in birmingham where the employment rate be around just that be not acceptable because when some part of our country fall behind economically it be bad for those place and bad for all of we because it mean that some people in our country can not play their full role in our economic growth economic inactivity be also high than the average and that be why our reform plan take different approach we be no long do the same thing everywhere but try to tailor and personalise our employment support to where people be and what they need
