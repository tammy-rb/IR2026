one of whom work for politician in this house order must stop the right hon gentleman it seem to that he be about to go down road on matter that be sub judice which can not be discuss here in this chamber the speaker make statement at the beginning of business early this week ask member not to refer to this matter because it be sub judice can the right hon gentleman ask his general question in different way and not refer to that specific issue thank you for your guidance madam deputy speaker shall ask policy question the government recently award contract for supercomputer to lenovo china headquarter firm that have be the subject of enforcement action by the united states on security ground this supercomputer will be use by critical government body such as the uk atomic energy authority how will ministers safeguard the public against any possible misuse of sensitive government datum as result of the awarding of the contract thank the right hon gentleman for his question know that he have also write to regard that topic can assure he that we will be work with the national cyber security centre and the national security secretariat to ensure that full check and measure be put in place to prevent such abuse from occur the right hon gentleman refer to his role as general election co ordinator for the labour party understand that he sit on the quad which determine labour policy so perhaps he could clear up for the benefit of we all this question on an issue of national security do the labour party support our billion increase in defence spending if he care about these thing the answer should be plainly yes we do when we announce policy we ensure that it be properly cost and fund which recommend to the deputy prime minister one other cyber threat that modern state be face be prepositioning the planting of destructive software in critical infrastructure that can then be activate at later date the director of the fbi say that prepositione of the volt typhoon type discover in american infrastructure be the define threat of our generation america cyber defence agency say that five eye ally be also likely to have be target have the government look for or find volt typhoon type infiltration of any part of our critical national it infrastructure and if so what action be be take to remove it the right hon gentleman have be around this place long enough to know that he be deliver non answer on labour support for defence spending the whole house will have note that although he raise an important issue in respect of prepositioning he will appreciate that there be limit to what can say from the dispatch box give that some of this relate to high side intelligence but assure he that we be work with our five eyes ally in particular the united states since the us and the uk have exceptional capability in these area to ensure that we both have adequate knowledge and understanding of such prepositioning and take effective step in respect of it eight week ago on february at first order question ask the minister without portfolio what the government would do to assist people who be adversely affect by the statute of limitation as result of have be injure by vaccine my right hon friend say in response that she have take the issue to the permanent secretary will she update we on what have happen with the permanent secretary over the past eight week thank my hon friend for ask that question he be tireless campaigner on this matter on which he have meet with and the secretary of state for health and social care as say to my hon friend be deal with this matter with the permanent secretary he will know that we have new permanent secretary in the department and we be work at pace to resolve it call the snp spokesperson last year the uk government promise to relocate hundred of civil service post to the north east of scotland it have now be confirm that the total number will be give the billion generate in energy revenue and the unparalleled potential of our area in power our green future can the minister please explain to the people of the north east of scotland how hundred and be now the same thing think the hon lady be refer to the second headquarters of the department for energy security and net zero in aberdeen which visit just before christmas think that there be misunderstanding about the number that be quote in the paper some job have move out of london as consequence of the place for growth programme will examine the number that have move to scotland and write to she to clarify the government position recently meet with emma howard boyd to discuss the interim finding of the mayor of london climate resilience review which she have be lead on it involve the work of many different government departments at national level will the minister update we on whether we be conduct similar exercise the review be look at what the impact would be of similar wave to the one we have couple of year ago flash flooding and all sort of thing it be not just the responsibility of desnz or the department for environment food and rural affairs it cover many departments so it be cabinet office responsibility it be an important question we be do exactly that extreme heat be something that we have to increasingly plan against that be why last year for the first time we introduce an alert system for extreme heat that match the alert system for extreme cold disagree though with the mayor of london that the way to deal with this be to start impose mph speed limit everywhere and an ultra low emission zone hope that the people of london will take the opportunity to vote against that next week early we hear number of statement from the opposition question ministerial integrity but perhaps they should look close to home to be precise at the first minister of wales and his link with donation to his leadership campaign and the development bank of wales can the minister tell we when the welsh labour party will apply to itself the standard that labour have call for in the chamber this order if you all shout can not hear what the hon lady be say but think there be some doubt the hon lady can not ask the minister question about what the labour party will do would she like to rephrase what she be say with reference to the link between the first minister of wales the donation to his campaign and the development bank of wales would the minister like to describe why this be such an issue for the people of wales while the opposition keep shout that we be do the wrong thing my hon friend make very strong point if devolve administration receive donation as part of political campaign if the leader of that administration receive donation at the same time that the development bank of wales make loan to subsidiary of that company that be surely matter of public interest it will be for the first minister of wales to determine what be appropriate but would have think some explanation would be the very least that the people of wales would expect last year the government pledge to introduce ministerial deed to legally commit ministers to keep to the after government business appointment rule if be cynical could think of reason why the government have not bring that commitment forward but might the minister give an idea of when he intend to do so the hon lady be right in july in response to those three report from the committee on standards in public life the boardman review and the public administration and constitutional affairs committee the government do say they would work up strengthen the rule on business appointment and develop that ministerial deed can not give an update at this point because it be work the deputy prime minister and his team be lead on but it be important work and we do need to get it right thank the paymaster general for all his hard work on the contaminated blood scandal however as you would expect madam deputy speaker still urge he to go far and fast to get this situation resolve if the infected blood compensation authority be to be establish upon royal assent can the minister outline the timescale and process for the appointment of the chair and the other director and how those with live experience will be involve and include among those director thank the right hon lady for her kind word and her constructive approach it be absolutely right that she continue to press as she do at every opportunity reflect on our conversation and what she have say to the key thing be to ensure that we maintain and reclaim the trust of the infected blood community in all its dimension she will know that be engage with they in depth over several meeting on and may sir brian langstaff make clear that the infected blood community and all those access the scheme should have role to play in its delivery so consequential to listen to what they say to will be think about how we build that in as she know the government have make provision for committee and sub committee to ensure representation of the community while also maintain an independent arm length body will need to reconcile those be sorry that can not give she timetable but be work on it in some detail if may press the deputy prime minister foreign office official have refuse to say whether lord cameron have recuse himself from part of his role as foreign secretary give his previous well pay work in promote the china back port city colombo can the minister tell the house whether the foreign secretary have recuse himself from any part of his ministerial duty as the hon gentleman will know shortly before take office the foreign secretary not only have all his interest properly review by the propriety and ethic team in my department but go through they with the independent adviser on minister interest the independent adviser set out all relevant interest and those have be publish so the information be transparently out there for people to be able to judge for themselves ever since the monster cyril smith formally of this house but initially mayor of rochdale the town have be blight by scandal of grooming and cover up we currently have man on bail on groom charge in rochdale the previous labour mayor of rochdale and the next mayor of rochdale the king representative be both investigate on charge of sexual malpractice towards young girl in their employ with all the power imbalance that that imply self regulation with no investigation by any outside party how can this be right what will the minister do to help to clean up rochdale as the hon gentleman will know any criminal allegation be properly matter for the court and he would not expect minister to comment on they from this dispatch box if he wish to write to in respect of the further allegation he make will be happy to take they up myself or with ministerial colleague what consideration have be give to the merit of make it illegal for public sector body to pay ransom if they be the victim of ransomware attack that be good question it be something the government continue to keep open and under review the argument against do so be that it could discourage company that be subject to ransomware attack from report they for example to the national cyber security centre those report help we to gather intelligence on the nature of those threat and to work with victim to resolve they it be not something rule out totally but that be the reason that we have not impose it so far the minister for veterans affairs the right hon member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer will know that many council in northern ireland have appoint veteran champion will he join in acknowledge the work that many veteran champion do will he also call on the wide range of political party on council in northern ireland to offer their unstinting support to those champion to help to deliver service to veteran yes of course we have make extraordinary progress on veteran affair in northern ireland recognise and have always recognise the unique difficulty of that veteran service and ensure that these people be look after because of their service should not be at the whim of different political party be work at pace to establish an outpost of the office for veterans affairs in northern ireland to create an environment where everyone can work together and pull together all the different service to get veteran care in northern ireland up to the same level as in england look forward to work with the hon gentleman and other elect representative out there from all party to make sure that we do the right thing with two former conservative prime ministers have recently contravene the ministerial code twice in the case of boris johnson and the radcliffe rule in the case of his successor the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss be it now tory party policy to routinely ignore the rule if not what sanction will they face the hon lady be correct to say that the book by the former prime minister my right hon friend the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss be review under the radcliffe rule the cabinet office do not clear it the overwhelming majority of book that be submit do comply we will have to keep these matter under review this be very simple question to the deputy prime minister do the foreign secretary stand recuse in any aspect of his job by virtue of his financial interest either now or before he be appoint to his post yes or no the labour party keep on push on this point but refer the hon gentleman to the late list of ministerial interest which be publish in december and provide detail of minister interest include those of the foreign secretary that be judge by the independent adviser to be relevant or could be perceive to be relevant to their ministerial role all of it be there in the public domain with reference to the write question that the parliamentary secretary to the cabinet office have answer can he outline what the government consider to be the difference between foreign court and an international court we have answer this question on number of occasion the paymaster general tell my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson that he could not give timeline with regard to the infected blood scandal compensation this subject be raise on an almost daily basis in this house by member on both side because our constituent just can not understand why it be take so long can he at least give an indication of when he think compensation might begin to be pay it be especially important give that as understand it one victim of the scandal die every four day the answer to this be to be find when

many time and as be very pleased to repeat what minister say at the dispatch box be not matter for the chair the hon gentleman point of order have bring we perfectly to just after am we can therefore

those affect also pay tribute to frank field the word say about frank in recent day really reflect who he be principle determined relentless kind generous and funny his tireless campaign against poverty and for opportunity and education change the life of so many child who will never know it my thought be with his family and friend as someone well experienced in divided weak government do the leader of the house share my concern that the snp have break its power share deal which its leader say only last night be in the good interest of scotland leave the people of scotland even bad off under the snp government one in six scot be on an nhs waiting list and people face high bill and high taxis do she think that be why the scottish greens the snp former partner accuse the snp of sell out future generation this have get nothing to do with the business of the house it absolutely do be ask the leader of the house for her opinion on these matter another week another litany of problem for the government last week there be more scandal and internal positioning and this week there be catalogue of failing the government flagship childcare plan be in tatter they spend month in denial yet this week the department for education finally admit what many parent have be experience that the roll out target be problematic yesterday the spending watchdog warn that the government plan do not achieve its primary aim or demonstrate value for money the report be damn about the dfe oversight and planning for new place can the right hon lady guarantee that full delivery of the plan be on track this be the reverse midas touch government only they could turn what should be popular policy into such vote loser another policy that the government have turn to dust be their pledge on renter right ahead of report stage of the bill on that subject yesterday the government table hundred of amendment poor reflection of the leader of the house oversight of the legislative agenda the amendment water down that weak bill even far and there be no guarantee that ban section eviction will ever happen be it any wonder that the renters reform coalition have pull its support for the bill despite the government finally pass their rwanda legislation it have emerge that around illegal migrant will languish in hotel at the taxpayer expense in perpetuity unable to be remove or even process because of the government last piece of legislation how be stop the small boat go the government promise level up yet the chair of middlesbrough football club former ben houchen superfan say that the tees valley mayor be give away our child future through his management of the south tees development corporation he be right be he in perhaps what will become the conservatives most lasting and damage legacy there be more worrying evidence today about generation lockdown among which there be not only massive school drop out and absenteeism rate but more drinking because this government fail to put in place the catch up support need it be no wonder that this country be cry out for change how be the leader of the house feel about her party chance next week we all want to know see that on the day we return after the local election there be general debate be that in anticipation of something or to keep government member away from westminster we be still wait on lot of important legislation order hesitate to interrupt the hon lady but will do so now before she come to her peroration early in her questioning she refer to matter in the scottish parliament and ask the leader of the house her opinion on they she have just ask the leader of the house her opinion on general political matter this be business question and it be about the business of the house let the hon lady question go very wide they do not have to be exactly about the business of the house for next week but they ought to relate to the business of the house of commons if rather than ask the opinion of the leader of the house she ask question about the business before we that would be perfectly in order thank you madam deputy speaker be about to ask why legislation such as the criminal justice bill and the sentencing bill be not come forward the week after the local election as have be demand by member on both side of the house many other thing could also come before we for debate yet the day we come back after the local election be very light wonder why that be have the leader of house clear her diary for that day too be that why we have such light business that week no matter how much the government mayors and candidate hide behind their green and purple branding there be no escape the fact that they be stand on the woeful record of this tory government we have plan they might not like it but we do to bring down waiting list to deliver low energy bill to build more home and as we have set out today to reform our railway in the interest of the travel public it be not more free cash as some have say the truth be that vote for the conservatives be vote for this chaotic mess to continue be it not the case that if people want change they have to vote labour next thursday first may send my thought and sentiment to all those affect by the appalling event in wales hope that the community recover swiftly may also place on record my sadness at the loss of our former colleague frank field who be mp for birkenhead for more than year when be go for candidate selection for the conservative party one of the question be ask be who in the labour party most admire and my answer be frank field many know he for his relentless work combat poverty and its cause but he have many other interest that he pursue with equal vigour be particularly pleased to work with he on try to secure the building of new ship in the uk and he be also fellow brexit campaigner the connection he have to the people he serve and the duty that he feel towards they and never waver from be profound and send my deep sympathy to all who know and love he may also pay tribute to dame elizabeth gardiner dcb kc for her service as first parliamentary counsel she be the first woman to hold that role in its year history and she have have very busy eight year place on record my thank to she for her service and wish she well also congratulate jessica de mounteney who succeed she the hon member for manchester central lucy powell ask about the snp be sure that we will come to that shortly but the greens leave the coalition provide the labour party with an opportunity think memo have go out to labour front benchers say that they should go easy on the snp with view to perhaps form some sort of coalition or alliance with it north of the border the hon lady and her party talk good talk she just have on childcare ensure that people have warm and secure home and level up the tees valley but it be the conservatives who be deliver the large expansion of free childcare it be the conservatives who have build million new home and be get people on the housing ladder and it be the conservative mayor ben houchen who have deliver regeneration for the tees valley and an employment rate above the national average in response to the point about the need for more and well competition the conservatives be introduce legislation and scheme to strengthen the arm of the consumer such as fairfueluk pumpwatch labour answer reduce competition far and be return to the british rail sandwich the hon lady tout the move that be announce today the shadow transport secretary the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh say that the change will be do at zero cost but we read that it will actually require billion of additional funding and will not deliver any fare decrease or improved service it be socialist ideology over practicality even lew adams aslef former secretary general say in the public sector all we get be cut cut cut and today there be more member in the trade union more train driver and more train run the reality be that it work we ve protect job and we get more job the hon member for manchester central raise the issue of rwanda in response to the british government need to control foreign national access to the uk the conservatives have be do the hard yard of institutional and legal reform we have introduce legislation establish the rwanda scheme and the home secretary be work to modernise the international framework that govern it in contrast labour have vote hundred of time against that legislation and say that it will scrap the rwanda scheme even if it be work instead it be pursue quota scheme that would see immigration rise we will never do that the hon lady talk of change but the labour party have not change at all while labour member have be scoff prawn cocktail they have be devise new business burden that they plan on introduce while pose next to submarine labour members several front bench members vote to scrap our deterrent and be refuse to match our baseline on defence spending while labour member criticise and sneer at those who celebrate the st george flag they be allow some of they to occupy the labour front bench today labour party be pack with the same old socialist and few new plastic patriot and no amount of window dressing on point of order madam deputy speaker interruption order before the leader of the house finish can take point of order if it relate directly to the matter that we be discuss absolutely madam deputy speaker the leader of the house be mislead the house interruption the leader of the house just say order hold on the hon lady can not accuse the leader of the house of mislead the house that would be quite wrong and if the leader of the house have do something along those line would have stop she immediately if the hon lady mean that she disagree with the leader of the house that be different matter madam deputy speaker it be matter of fact that labour members celebrate st george day we all put it on our social medium and the leader of our party have make point of wrap himself in the flag the leader of the house be completely incorrect in what she just say to the house think the

point of order while the leader of the house be still on her foot be quite sure that the leader of the house do not intend to make any misdirection would she care to take that point have finish my

london but there be something that not just government members but the general london public can do in the come day and that be vote in new mayor of london think people will agree that you be indeed safer with susan call scottish national party spokesman associate myself with the comment about the dreadful news from wales and of course those about frank field make no apology for start this week where finish last week the leader of the house may recall that ask for debate on the new brexit border control due to come into effect next week answer come there none but thing become clear later on as the financial times report within hour of my question the uk government have tell the country port authority that it will not turn on critical health and safety check for eu import because of the risk of significant disruption the new border system will not be fully ready it be be call phase implementation approach very yes minister speak from some hapless civil servant try to excuse the sixth such delay more delay more confusion for business but no statement from the minister scotland importer exporter agricultural and hospitality sector and business large and small be all at their wit end because the tories insist on impose their brexit folly on we brexit be estimate to be cost salmon producer the large food exporter in the uk up to million year tourism in the highland and island have be devastate with staff shortage affect of business to date brexit be name as the main difficulty for of business in scotland trade overseas before the late delay be announce the chair of the chilled food association which represent trade and professional organisation say that every time there be proposal from the uk government people invest in paperwork and computer system and then the government change the rule again since million will have be spend on just one export health certificate recent report find that the uk economy have shrink by billion with the average citizen around bad off thank to good old brexit that scotland do not vote for yet this place shut its eye to the devastating impact that brexit have have on people life and business scot be accustomed to be ignore overrule and treat with disdain by this government but be drag out of the eu against our will have be an economic and social disaster for we no party can claim to be the party of business and back brexit so urge the leader of the house to overcome the vow of silence an omertà between the tory and labour party and tell we when we can have an urgent debate on the effect of brexit start with this disastrous delay tory trade tax despite what the hon lady say we have now become the fourth large exporter in the world will not annoy the hon lady by list how well the nation be do on trade fishing and many of the thing that we want to see improve to give people new opportunity because know it would irritate she it be no surprise to that snp members do not want to face reality they do not want to engage with the trader support service that be support business very well or with the fact that we be create an interface directly between the it system in business and the legacy government system such as his majesty revenue and customs so that we reduce bureaucracy for those trader and support they in meet their ambition it be no surprise that snp members do not want to deal with the reality of the situation give the reality of the situation now for the snp minority administration with their failing and some very serious issue that we all know be now subject to prosecution as well as investigation not even the greens want anything to do with they may first pay tribute to lord field he be one of my political hero and first meet he when be year old student along with my right hon friend the member for harlow robert halfon as his constituency member of parliament be delighted to inform the house that he continue to correspond with on the issue and campaign that he care about until the very end of his life as part of our national health strategy we rightly emphasise the importance of eat healthily and take physical exercise but we do not take sleep into account today the sleep charity publish dream of change manifesto for sleep which highlight the serious mental and physical health problem that lack of sleep can cause among both child and adult would my right hon friend consider debate in government time on the vital public health importance of get more sleep thank my hon friend for raise that incredibly important issue we could run positive public health campaign rather than just tell people not to drink or smoke we should also ask they whether they have have enough sleep we should be proud of the research that have be do in the uk professor russell foster at oxford university have do amazing work which be lead to improvement in the general population but particularly among veteran who have suffer blast injury and lose their sight would be happy to raise what my hon friend have say with the secretary of state for health and social care because think that that would be very good initiative first associate myself with the comment about our old friend frank whom know for many year it be widely acknowledge in this chamber and elsewhere that iran be run and control by bunch of clerical fascist and homicidal maniacs who have now take to attack people on british soil which be bit of break with what use to happen however there be difference of opinion over how we should respond especially with regard to the islamic revolutionary guard corps know that we have have plenty of statement and urgent question about iran but could we have statement next week the point raise by the hon gentleman be regular theme at business question and throughout the week these be very serious matter and he be right to point out that this activity be not limit to the strait of hormuz or other part of the world but be take place on british soil our citizen be be threaten and many representative such as councillor and other who hold public office be have to be protect as result of the appalling campaign against they and the death threat will ensure that those at the foreign commonwealth and development office have hear what the hon gentleman have say and will encourage they to update the house the united kingdom have vibrant classic car sector but the driver and vehicle licensing agency seem to have take against it somewhat force car that have be subject to modest repair or even heinous crime such as the fitting of seatbelt to have plate as know from attend the heritage matters insight day event hold by the historic classic vehicles alliance during the easter recess and indeed from my own inbox the problem seem to be get bad have raise it numerous time in the transport committee but it be not go away may we have debate in government time to iron out these issue and ensure that the department for transport get grip on the dvla attitude to the classic car sector would be happy to raise the hon gentleman point with the transport secretary as transport question will not take place again until may this be not just about people personal vehicle it concern an enormous number of uk business we have huge export market and britain be of course very well know for its motor sport and motoring in general congratulate my hon friend on his campaign on this important matter and will ensure that all relevant secretaries of state have hear what he have say frank field be great mate we even forgave he in the end for his daft view on brexit he be great guy and great colleague and we miss he dearly genuinely seek the guidance of the leader of the house this morning be not try to make political point we have work very hard to ensure that standard in this house be of the high order and my hon friend the member for rhondda sir chris bryant have play big part in that this parliament reputation be base on standard here and in the upper house be it possible for she to have conversation with her senior colleague in the house of lords do not know whether she see recent article in the sunday times that say the earl of oxford and asquith former chief in moscow be lobbyist for man in the us who be believe to be involve in russian gang crime everybody know there be group in the upper house that be very close to russia could we look into this issue it will impinge on parliament if it be not deal with be the hon gentleman relate his question to the business of the house oh and may we have an early debate on it be grateful to the hon gentleman hope that other will follow his learn example will answer the hon gentleman with the same good faith with which he ask his question if he have serious concern about anyone on the parliamentary estate he need to raise they formally and in the appropriate way with the house authority that would be the right course of action if he have genuine concern about anyone do not quite agree with the last answer give by the leader of the house we know who we be talk about and agree with those on the opposition side of the house may we have debate in government time on the three rivers development in mid devon have mention this before which be now become cover up and financial scandal the chairman of the scrutiny committee have do runner and slunk off to rent accommodation in bampton which be disgrace be afraid this be now become serious issue for local government mid devon council have no scrutiny no responsibility and absolutely no idea what it be do in government time can we talk about local government that be not take its financial responsibility seriously and be cover up major issue be sorry to hear about what sound like very concern issue that be affect my hon friend constituent give that the next question to the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities be not until june will ensure that he have hear what my hon friend have say today may add my condolence to the family of lord field he be an exceptional man and an outstanding politician and have the privilege of know he for two year while he be still member of parliament work or study in other country have wide range benefit for young people perhaps the sad outcome of brexit be that the number of young people from the uk work and study in eu country and the number of young people from the eu work and study here have dramatically reduce in order to reverse this worrying trend last week the eu propose youth mobility visa but the government reject they outright even though they would have bring wide range and welcome boost to our economy mean that in good faith can we please have statement from the government on why that proposal be reject outright and how they propose to boost youth mobility between eu country and the uk thank the hon lady for raise this issue she will know that our approach have be to widen opportunity for our citizen and give they more choice about where they might want to study abroad think that the secretary of state do put out statement explain why the scheme be not deem to be in our interest and it be due to the fact that it be not go to be reciprocal this be the first time in my year as member of parliament that have raise this sort of frustration and complaint so hope my right hon friend realise how serious it be over month ago write to the foreign secretary about british citizen whose husband be be hold illegally in foreign country without trial have try repeatedly to ask the foreign secretary for reply and go to

the judgment the government have make know that the right hon gentleman take those new responsibility very seriously as he know both departments have make it clear that they be perfectly happy to attend and be scrutinise in respect of those decision and to answer question on the government position twenty day notice sound like long time but he will understand that the ministers in question may have travel obligation and might therefore have be unable to make the specific date know that he know last friday that they would not be able to attend the session that take place yesterday also know that the deputy foreign secretary speak to he and hope reassure the right hon gentleman of his intention to field minister for his committee even though be not tell the right hon gentleman anything he

green ministers in that they have be cut off from government service in kirkliston the post office be go to close which will deny many of my constituent access to vital government service and to cash as no banking facility be available within easy reach by public transport know that the minister of state department for business and trade the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake be

charge with sexual or violent crime risk assessment will be carry out follow potentially if necessary by an exclusion or suspension from work pende further investigation and if necessary trial the standards committee and the house of commons commission agree that we should have something similar for this house which have be sit on the stop now for several month understand there be perfectly legitimate question about exactly how that should operate but do not understand why the leader of the house have not table the motion that come straight from the house of commons commission which

ofsted be publish on march put on record my thank to the clerks of our committee for their brilliant work to our expert adviser and to all the teacher leader inspector former inspector and education expert who contribute evidence member of the committee as well as our witness bring with they experience of the inspection process both from the receiving end as teacher and governor and in the case of my hon friend the member for meon valley mrs drummond as former inspector the pressure of local election mean that many member who contribute to the report can not be in the chamber today but be glad that we be able to make all of our recommendation unanimously and be grateful for the contribution of member on all side of the house our inquiry be call in the midst of heighten concern about school inspection follow the tragic event at caversham primary school while the inquiry be not focus on that specific case and have to be careful to not trespass on the work of the coroner which be ongoing for much of its duration pay tribute to the family of ruth perry for the dignified and thoughtful way in which they have seek to raise concern and ensure that lesson be learn and reform make the coroner report just before the end of the inquiry and we include in our report commitment to follow up on all of their recommendation something that know every member of my committee be look forward to be able to do we will be take evidence from the new chief inspector before the summer the inquiry hear widespread agreement on the importance of an accountability system and the roll of an independent inspectorate but also concern about stress and anxiety experience by school staff due to high stake nature of ofsted inspection the report highlight criticism of how inspection be carry out and report the workload they generate and the complaint system we hear concern from current and former inspector about the length and depth of inspection and we take evidence on the impact of successive framework over time the committee hear that relation between ofsted and the school sector have become extremely strained and that trust in the inspectorate be worryingly low we say in our report that the appointment of new chief inspector provide crucial opportunity to restore trust and in that regard our first recommendation be that in his big listen with the sector his majesty chief inspector must ensure that he listen to wide range of view include those of teacher school and trust leader governor parent and pupil in do that he must ensure that ofsted be genuinely open to engage and willing to reflect on where it need to improve we be glad that the process be treat seriously in both ofsted and the department response ofsted say we have do much since january but more much more be to come we launch the big listen on friday march we want to hear from those we work with and those we work for we know that we need to do more ensure inspection be carry out with professionalism courtesy empathy and respect and conduct listening exercise be not enough action must and will follow we fundamentally believe that those action should not be base on the view of hmci alone that be why we be conduct serious exercise to gather the view of as many people as possible where nothing be off the table the department place welcome emphasis on that big listen in its response today it mention the process no few than time in the space of page of response the inquiry hear serious concern about the single word judgment the committee have make recommendation to both ofsted and the department for education to rethink the process to consider serious alternative and to look at what other jurisdiction do inside and outside the united kingdom in that respect as part of that we encourage they to use this process to engage in serious discussion about genuine alternative we also encourage they both not just to focus on the overall judgment but to encourage school and the department to look at all the sub judgment reach within ofsted report and publicise those just as much as they do the headline judgment in its response ofsted be clear that that be within the scope of the big listen the department stress what it see as the significant benefit of the current system but be clear that it be continue to listen to the sector view and to look at alternative to four single word judgment include look at various approach take internationally that in itself would represent welcome shift from some of the language use during our inquiry and welcome acknowledgment of the need to look at alternative be disappointed however that this morning the department appear to have go far and rule out change to single word judgment prejudge the outcome of the consultation process and make any consideration of alternative system academic minister would be well advise not to rule out any change both they and ofsted would be right to ensure that feedback from the big listen and wide range of comparison can be take into account before final decision be make we be glad that both ofsted and the department have emphasise the importance of all judgment and set out step to improve the visibility of sub judgment as per our recommendation in conjunction with that the committee say that dfe should reassess its policy of maintain school that receive two require improvement judgment be require to become academy we also call on the department to ensure that regional director who decide academisation order genuinely take into account the view of local stakeholder before make decision and call for an increase in its accountability to this house dfe response say it keep this policy under review and will have regard to stakeholder view it also argue that presumption in favour of academy order be rebuttable and that in each case the particular circumstance of the school and the need of its pupil will be assess in the round in order to establish the good course of action the department confirm in line with civil service convention across government regional directors continue to be available to give evidence if call before parliament however it go on to say approval for their attendance before the committee rest with the secretary of state hope that my committee or its successor will be able to hear evidence directly from they give the wide scope of their power and their importance within the system that be an important element of accountability the committee also find broad agreement that inspection be not long enough to cover the full framework and give an accurate picture of school performance give that there be finite funding we accept that any increase to the length of inspection would require decrease in their frequency and we be clear that we do not wish to return to the previous exemption for outstanding school which stay in place for too long on balance we recognise that there be case to be make for small reduction in the frequency of inspection to increase their value length and depth in the short term the department should work with ofsted to enable the inspectorate to reduce the frequency of inspection to approximately five to six year for good and outstanding school and three to four year for school judge require improvement or inadequate that should be support by well use of risk assessment to identify the school most in need of inspection ofsted should use the additional resource release by that change to enable inspection to be carry out in more depth in the long term the department should support ofsted in make strong case to the treasury for additional funding to carry out in depth inspection funding for ofsted should not be see as be in competition with school funding and any additional funding for the inspectorate must not result in less funding be make available to school ofsted have be clear that it want to consult on the regularity and depth of inspection in the big listen but it point out reasonably that change the five year timeframe be not in its gift as it be set in legislation the department have reject our recommendation that it should consider reduction in the regularity of inspection to increase their depth but it have acknowledge that it will work in partnership with ofsted to ensure that it have appropriate resource to carry out its programme effectively perhaps unsurprisingly ofsted state we very much welcome the committee commitment to support we in ask for additional funding for more in depth inspection as an example we could inspect school in great depth by ensure that every inspection be lead by one of his majesty inspector and that each inspection team have an additional inspector that could provide number of additional benefit it would allow the team more time to look at school unique approach and allow for dedicated focus on national priority area in each inspection ofsted have cost that at million year and we hope that ministers will consider that proposal in future spending review discussion with the treasury another area of key interest for the committee be multi academy trust accountability my predecessor as chair my right hon friend the member for harlow robert halfon call on ofsted to have role in that that be also call for in the beyond ofsted report by lord knight and the idea have enjoy strong cross party support in this chamber the committee argue that the department for education should urgently authorise ofste to develop framework for the inspection of mats and set out plan for build expertise and capacity in this area in its response ofsted state we welcome recommendation and the committee agree with our evidence that inspection of mats be appropriate and inevitable the dfe response say that it continue to actively consider how we might strengthen scrutiny of mats it add this might include the role of ofsted we look forward to hear view on this issue through ofsted big listen we welcome the change in tone in this response when the former schools minister my right hon friend the member for bognor regis and littlehampton nick gibb give evidence to the committee during our inquiry he appear strongly oppose to mat inspection we have press the urgency of action in this space and it feel like it be step close give the large and grow role that mats play in the school system we continue to believe that mechanism for their accountability need to be strong welcome the acceptance of our recommendation and by ofsted and its commitment to explore recommendation to and and through the big listen the one recommendation that ofsted reject be for an independent review of the challenge for inspector retention but it do so on the basis that it feel that it already know the answer to those challenge and that review would not be good use of taxpayer money which we can understand we welcome the respect that the government have show to the big listen through their response but recognise that many will not be satisfy by conversation and will continue to call for more urgent reform the government response highlight important change include for those school rat inadequate purely on the basis of safeguarding those can be rapidly re inspect which be certainly welcome change there be hopeful sign about the new chief inspector intent but the committee will continue to hold he and the inspectorate to account for how they deliver want to give member the opportunity to respond so will conclude by say that what our committee hear overall be that ofsted be need and play an important role in the system but it need to change we will continue to hold the department and the inspectorate to account for the change that we need to see thank the chair of the education committee for bring forward this statement follow the committee much need inquiry and report on this issue in the report he rightly extend his condolence and gratitude to the family friend and colleague of ruth perry all of whom have contribute to this report at an incredibly difficult time labour welcome the finding on ofsted single word judgment but the government seem to have defend the indefensible in their response the current system be high stake for teacher and low information for parent like his cross party committee we believe that it must be reform far to the chair comment do he agree that the government should look again at the response that the committee receive from those across the sector who overwhelmingly want to reform the system just as labour consider the sector when set out our plan for report card which have be welcome by the former chief inspector similarly on inspection of multi academy trust the government seem simply to have ignore recommendation that ofsted chief inspector have call inevitable will the chair therefore outline what conversation he have have with ministers on the issue and any further work that his committee might do in this area finally the committee inquiry do not appear to extend to inclusion be part of ofsted inspection framework labour propose to ensure that child with special educational need and disability have access to clear information and that their parent understand their child school in that regard will the chair and his committee look at that thank he again for the thorough and timely work that he and the committee have undertake and for the light that it have shed on this important and press issue be grateful to the hon lady for her response she raise some important point express my disappointment that the government seem to have rule out our recommendation that we move away from single word judgment and explore alternative it be important that the big listen be proper process of listening and engagement and that it can reach its own conclusion be more inclined to agree with what be say in ofsted response about nothing be off the table there be an extremely strong case for mat inspection that case have be hear by those in all part of the house it be reflection of the maturity of mats and their huge contribution to the school system which the government response acknowledge that we be have this debate there be significant move forward in the tone of the government response on that welcome the fact that they be actively explore the option of course that need to be do proportionately and we need to ensure that it do not increase the burden on any school be sure that can be work through by the department have some sympathy for the idea that inclusion need to be consider in previous committee session know this happen under the previous chair we test that idea in many respect and some previous recommendation of the committee have be feed into the framework such as the recommendation that no school should be rat good or outstanding for performance unless its performance for special educational need pupil be good or outstanding it be important to acknowledge that some progress have be make on that front but believe that balance attainment and inclusion be always important throughout education so that be an interesting contribution of course because that be not part of government policy or the current framework it be not within the term of reference for our inquiry congratulate my hon friend on the report and welcome the recommendation on ofsted supervision of mats but may turn to career advice in school my first ever speech in the house of commons my maiden speech be about try to encourage more school to encourage student to do apprenticeship as well as to go to university while much progress have be make on this issue we be in very different world in from that of there be still much more work to be do include on inform student in all school that there be great level offering and great apprenticeship offering as well do he agree that ofsted need much tough measure on ensure that school encourage student to take up all the apprenticeship and other skill offering so that student have choice other than go to university my right hon friend know more about this issue than almost anyone else in the house and have make huge contribution to the debate on skill he be of course absolutely right about the importance of career advice and of signpost people towards vocational opportunity in school this be the subject of an inquiry and report that he as chair bequeath to when he move on it be about career education information advice and guidance in that report we make recommendation that ofsted should align its work on personal development and its work in this space with the gatsby benchmark the work he do on put those benchmark more prominently in our education system both as chair of the select committee and subsequently as minister be vital to the success of that process so congratulate he on that we absolutely think that need to be part of this role our one wariness be that we do not want to recommend huge slew of thing that ofsted should be add to the inspection process or framework because we do not want to increase the workload or pressure on teacher and leader all these thing need to be look at in proportion but there be absolutely place for ensure that school provide the right career advice and range of opportunity to student thank the chair and the committee for their excellent work on this very important matter also pay tribute to my constituent ruth perry who be an outstanding headteacher the event at caversham primary must never be allow to happen again also commend the work by julia waters ruth sister and local campaigner and head in the read area as well as other across the country who have listen and call for ofsted reform offer my wholehearte support for an end to the single word judgment and for wide ofsted reform as mention by my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell on our front bench what step do the committee chair believe the government should take now give their unfortunate announcement this morning do he believe that the response from the department for education and ofsted so far have be remotely adequate particularly the suggestion about use former chief inspector to mark ofsted homework and continue to ignore concern raise by he and the coroner about this serious matter be grateful to the hon gentleman for the way in which he have engage on this issue and for rightly champion the interest of his late constituent and her sister who have engage with this process in good faith throughout she have have meeting with the secretary of state and the new chief inspector of ofsted and know that she be not satisfied that the government have go far enough urge the government and ofsted to ensure that the big listen be genuine process that take nothing off the table and to respond in depth to the feedback on that it be absolutely legitimate for the hon gentleman constituent to raise concern about the independence of the person appoint to look into this matter but point out that other organisation include the national education union not notably friend of ofsted have praise the appointee for their independence this matter will have to be consider carefully it be vital that the process be see to be conduct independently of both the current and former management of ofsted and that it offer genuine insight into what go wrong at caversham and how that can be put right it be important to acknowledge the change in both the ofsted and government response today the step already take to provide well support to headteacher and the change in the approach to school that be rat inadequate on one factor which will get the opportunity to be reinspecte it be also worth put on the record that subsequent to inspection caversham primary be rat good which show that that approach can and should work as member of the select committee on education thank my hon friend for his excellent statement and for the fantastic report on which it be base also thank my hon friend for be brilliant chair of the committee it be an almost impossible job to take on give the big boot he have to fill see the former select committee chair my right hon friend the member for harlow robert halfon in his place he literally put the word degree apprenticeship into the oxford english dictionary want to talk about the report recommendation the committee strongly recommend that the process for multi academy trust inspection be deliver urgently that recommendation be also make by predecessor and other and be indeed be accept by ofsted be pleased about the change in tone from the government and that they be actively consider this but do my hon friend agree we need to go far do he agree that give that mats be now the big part of the education system we need to go beyond actively consider we must accept these recommendation and the mat inspection regime should be deliver urgently in word yes long time ago when be teacher at radyr comprehensive school and the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken be pupil there we be inspect it be necessary part of the system but can be very challenging for all concerned very much welcome the if may use single word outstanding report from the select committee today and be very disappointed that the government have not accept its recommendation one be about extend the length of time before school that be give an outstanding rating be re inspect some year ago the government have to row back from allow school rat as outstanding to go uninspected for as long as year with the result that on re inspection more than be downgrade as we have hear over and again in the chamber that be statistical fix to make it look as if there be more outstanding school in the country be the hon gentleman confident that if the period be extend we could avoid leave school with previous outstanding finding to languish uninspected when there be in fact problem in those school the hon gentleman raise an important point as he often do when become minister in the department one of the first question ask official be whether that exception be still in place and whether if it be we could end it and be relieve to discover that my predecessor my right hon friend the member for bognor regis and littlehampton nick gibb have already remove that outstanding exception if he have not do that would have do so because share many of the hon gentleman concern about the length such finding be in place that be clearly mistake and it build up pressure in the system which be deeply unfortunate in some circumstance we have now go back to five yearly cycle what we be query be whether we could be more risk base in our approach all school should be inspect on regular basis but we make the argument for good and outstanding school to be inspect slightly less regularly and for those which require improvement or be judge inadequate to be inspect more regularly so that they have the opportunity to turn themselves around quickly understand and respect the reason why the government might not think that that be appropriate and feel the need for level playing field they reject that art of the recommendation but we anticipate that they might do so and therefore also recommend that they need to help ofsted make the case to the treasury for the funding necessary to do all the inspection properly particularly for school in need of turnaround school which know they need to improve and which need the resource and support of an in depth inspection that engage with teacher across the board that be the case we be make and read the government response as partial acceptance of that case albeit not one that put we at any risk of return to situation where school languish uninspected for long period of time on point of order madam deputy speaker this house be both the good and bad workplace in the world for those with disability or disadvantage the reason raise this be that constantly lift do not work button do not work in lift door do not work properly and toilet be always out of order and take month to fix just below the chamber on the low ground floor there be toilet that have be out for almost six month on end and no one ever seem to be there do anything to fix they this be not acceptable any long have be here for year and while every single member of staff be incredibly kind especially the doorkeepers find it incredible that thing have get bad over the past year in term of door be shut lift not work button not work lift door not work toilet be out of order and people who should not be use disabled toilet use they we do nothing about it yet we publish press statement say we be inclusive and diverse employer but that mean nothing to anyone so may urge you madam deputy speaker mr speaker and the other deputy speakers to look at this issue with the serjeant at arm and get these facility fix once and for all so that people with disadvantage can go about their business without have to worry about door be shut and toilet be break and the other thing have mention as the right hon gentleman may know it might be appropriate to raise those matter with the administration committee as well but will certainly ensure that his comment be feed back the deputy serjeant at arms be present and be sure that he will be one of those feed it back be very sorry to hear of the experience that the right hon gentleman have describe of course it be right that those facility should be in good working order and that there should be proper provision for people with disability on point of order madam deputy speaker we really should not be have too many point of order at this stage but will take the hon lady point of order if it relate to something that have just be say thank you madam deputy speaker follow what be say by the right hon member for harlow robert halfon want to add that have recently notice that additional security door have be introduce around the estate and they require pass to be swipe there be nothing to enable blind or partially sight people to understand that and in an emergency it could cost they their life could this be add to the list of thing that you will feed back madam deputy speaker will certainly add that to the feedback that we will give backbench business lesbian visibility week beg to move that this house have consider the importance of lesbian visibility week and believe lgbtqia woman and non binary people should be recognise for the work they do and the joy they bring lesbian visibility week be found in by the publisher of diva magazine my good friend linda riley and be delighted to welcome linda to the house today for the past five year we have set aside this week in april to celebrate and

protection under the law and the same right to love whoever they want to love do the hon lady feel that we have make progress towards situation in which that will be the case unfortunately have to say that we have go backwards in recent time think we would be far forward than we be but when look back to some year ago see that that be not the case week like this really matter they show solidarity and they enable we to support each other and help we to celebrate our difference embrace the whole community too often people seek to divide we but as the theme of this lesbian visibility week show we be unified not uniform we be here to be fabulous in our difference and to be see to let other know that they can be their true self we have to use our own experience to help people and to use our platform to give people space that be what lesbian visibility week be about that be why be hold this debate an often use expression be that we stand on the shoulder of giant which we do and want to honour just few of the wonderful woman who have give so much to our community and be inspirational to and to so many other in the maureen colquhoun make history by become the first openly out lesbian in parliament her courageous act in the face of media hostility have mean that so many of we can stand in this chamber today and follow in her footstep my hon friend the member for wallasey dame angela eagle be an iconic lesbian in parliament the first to come out in office and now dame she be role model to many break down barrier as the first lesbian minister and always fight for equality by use her platform to stand up for our community of course there be brilliant woman who be the drive force behind so many political and campaigning movement lisa power be one of the found member of stonewall in like she be volunteer at the lesbian and gay switchboard lisa have lead decade long fight on behalf of people live with hiv there be woman such as the brilliant sue sanders the founder of history month and baroness barker who lead the first ever debate in the other place on lesbian bisexual and transgender woman health there be historic queer trailblazer such as anne lister who be fabulously represent by suranne jones in gentleman jack be distraught when find out that gentleman jack would not be return for third season for the first time see someone on tv who represent so much

fight to address the vile mistreatment of veteran and those who be still in the army and she be now empower woman through her athena effect event of course there be also linda riley one of my good friend who be the founder of lesbian visibility week and publisher of diva magazine she be titan who have do so much for lesbian and who know will do so much more in her lifetime let we not forget another good friend of mine nancy kelley who be in the gallery today nancy have recently be appoint as the director of lesbian visibility week she have already be trailblazer as chief executive of stonewall and an award win human right and social justice campaigner she be champion of right who always stand up for our community so be excited to see what big and bright thing be next for lesbian visibility week in the year to come although there be lot to celebrate it be important that we do not forget the challenge that lesbian still face in fact in celebrate lesbian visibility week have face some awful homophobic remark on social medium simply for be open about my sexuality have be call nonce and have threat on twitter or receive constant barrage of homophobic abuse but such abuse will not stop stand here or speak up on behalf of my community the toxic culture on social medium and the toxic narrative from the government at time in push their war on woke make people less safe we have see rise in hate crime and we must make active effort to support our non binary and trans community who still face unique day to day challenge simply for be themselves and love who they love last october lead debate call on the government to remove the additional financial burden for same sex couple who need to access in vitro fertilisation the minister commit then to timetable to remove the barrier and bring forward statutory instrument to end the postcode lottery for same sex couple seek ivf so where be it the legislation have still not materialise before qualify for ivf on the nhs same sex female couple must fund six cycle of artificial insemination so it come as no surprise that too often people be be price out of start family my constituent holly and leanne have have to choose between buy house or have baby decision that couple should never be force to make they have be unable to afford ivf and be now like so many look at alternative route we need to see action because many can not wait any long today we be tell that young people be too woke and that it be fine for young people when they come out yet the reality be often very different child be twice as likely as other to be bully some young people be still kick out and make homeless when they come out and many do not feel safe where they live the albert kennedy trust report that of young people give family rejection abuse or be ask to leave home as cause for their homelessness diva survey in show that less than third of woman and tran people in the uk feel safe where they live to have this continue today be dystopian just yesterday ask the deputy prime minister about ivf provision and point out that the community be be let down his response be that the government have be excellent but can tell the house that none of the lesbian have speak to this week think the government be excellent at anything we must use our platform and our ability to speak up to highlight our diversity and to look at the impact of intersectionality we must consider how the world be for lesbian of colour and lesbian with disability and how the gender health gap and gender pay gap negatively impact on we all but in different way be privileged to be able to stand up in parliament and say all this because in third of country across the world include un member state it be illegal to be until we have win equality for all people globally the fight go on wish everyone happy and safe lesbian visibility week congratulate my hon friend the member for jarrow kate osborne on secure this debate and on her excellent speech at first think what be go to say in this debate because be not lesbian but have stand in this chamber and speak on many issue the thing be you do not have to be lesbian to speak in this debate what you have to be be good person you have to be person who believe in equality and fairness that be what be important as my hon friend the member for jarrow say lesbian visibility week be create by bestie of our linda riley who be in the gallery today she have fight all her life to be hear and to be her authentic self and what she want more than anything be for everybody else to have that same privilege yesterday we watch documentary the life of riley as an activist and butch lesbian linda have support everybody in the community she can do that and support trans people because the two thing be not mutually exclusive believe it be more important to know what be in people heart than what be in their pant and that we should spend more time talk about what be in people heart nobody want to erase lesbian honestly would feel sorry for anyone who try and this debate highlight that remember my hon friend the member for llanelli dame nia griffith be sorry if mispronounce her constituency talk about her experience when she be teacher her girlfriend be sick and my hon friend be unable to talk about it in her workplace because she be not out we should all think very carefully about that in relation to allow people to be their authentic self another lesbian sally come out at work during lesbian visibility week it stop lot of man come on to she which she be grateful for but some other man think oh give it try get over it some woman be lesbian get over it linda welcome lesbian and make they feel safe in her environment have watch how she look after the people my hon friend the member for jarrow mention people like kelly holmes who keep her sexuality secret because of her time in the army but who be now an activist and advocate and engage to wonderful beautiful woman call louise that be the power of allow people to be their authentic self and just allow they to live give they space to grow and be happy do not care who people love as long as it be legal love who you like the world would be well place if there be more love there be too much hate right now and think we need more love in the world as my hon friend say in some country two consent sex people be not allow to love each other that be wrong linda talk about lgb with the the trans debate have be extremely toxic the debate in this house last week make trans kid and trans adult feel like they do not exist like we want to erase they this be the mother of all parliaments we should not have debate in this place that make people feel that they do not exist or that we want they to be erase spend lot of time over the weekend speak to dr cass and be grateful to she for her time she be advise not to travel on public transport because of her report before it be even publish some people include some mp imply that have contribute to that but dr cass say could quote she say that that be absolutely ridiculous feel really hurt and offend because they encourage pile on on over the weekend say to those who think they can silence and stop stick up for marginalised or minoritise group think again that be literally what have be elect to do in this place to speak up for people who may not be able to speak up for themselves and be not go to stop people be make thing up about they should read my book which be happy to plug purposeful in all good bookshop now be clear about why be an activist and why campaign the way do as discuss in my book the equality act and the gender recognition act have no bearing on each other therefore you can be feminist and stick up for the right of woman and also be trans ally that think show the very good of humanity and we all need little bit more of that it be real privilege to speak in this debate congratulate my hon friend the member for jarrow kate osborne on secure it and on her excellent opening speech also thank our fantastic ally our hon friend the member for brent central dawn butler for all that she do for the pertinent point she make about support the whole lgbt community and for all the work she have do in stand up for tran people must not forget our hon friend the member for wallasey dame angela eagle an outstanding champion who long before many of we be in parliament be fly the flag in what be very lonely place at the time it be also real privilege to attend the event on monday that my hon friend the member for jarrow organise and to meet linda riley the publisher of diva and professor sue sanders the co founder of lgbt history month just to be among such people be such an honour for someone like think back to year ago diva be quite lifeline for people as isolate as we be in south west wales perhaps not know anyone quite like we and certainly not want to be open about ourselves because we be worried about society reaction at the time of section be in relationship with another woman both of we be teacher and this be very inhibiting as have previously say in this chamber and in westminster hall it be very difficult time time when it be not easy to challenge the homophobic bullying that be go on then and which still go on now thank all those who be braver than be and come out soon than do apologise to the house for intervene but have to go with my wife to celebrate she year as chancellor of the university of hull the hon lady be rightly talk about the bullying and the fear she experience there have be some of that more recently start to become conscious of some of the issue when kathleen stock be be bully mercilessly in sussex we ought to be careful if be to make speech in this debate would say that two of the great event have be to be the lgb alliance conference meeting which be picket by people who seem to hate the people inside they would not come inside to listen they be shout outside that kind of attitude have echo of what speaker today have talk about as my hon friend the member for brent central have say there be real need to approach these thing in calm and appropriate way and to respect everybody different way of manifest their humanity what for be very telling be the fact that come out when my relationship break up it be almost impossible to hide grief it be ironic that have spend considerable period not be open and try not to make it obvious that we be in relationship it be when we do not need that hide approach any more that come out it be incredibly difficult to explain to people why you be in such state of grief if you do not explain the relationship what be interesting about that be not only the reaction of very supportive friend which be great but find that some people have never guess be quite shocked and surprise by that it be strange to realise that we be more hidden than we understand because people do not see lesbian that show the importance of lesbian visibility week perhaps because society be so male dominate and woman be marginalise in many respect or perhaps because woman be more likely to be see do thing together hold hand or go on holiday with other woman we be not even notice one of the important aspect of raise lesbian visibility be enable people to be their natural self and enable other people to recognise that of course that have mean over the year that woman be perhaps not the subject of homophobic legislation in many way it reflect the role of woman as society be then and that woman be very marginalise and not see that be perhaps part of the wide picture of where woman be there have be workplace stereotype woman have to dress in certain way and behave in certain way towards heterosexual man or they be expect to do so when they do not be that as lesbian or as heterosexual woman it can be interpret negatively which have often hold lesbian woman back over the year it be form of discrimination and stereotyping that have have pernicious result it be not enough for we to hope that attitude can change hope be not enough we all have responsibility to challenge and to use our legislative power to strengthen our challenge through legislation we be proud as labour government from to to do number of important thing that help lgbt right include end the ban on lgbt people serve in our armed force end discrimination against lesbian and gay partner for immigration purpose and give lgbt individual and couple the right to adopt child of course we scrap section which be very important for people like but we also ban discrimination in the workplace and in vocational training with the introduction of the employment equality sexual orientation regulations we also include homophobia in the definition of hate crime sadly we have see rise in hate crime in recent year to which draw the government attention in particular ask that more should be do to tackle homophobic include transphobic hate crime of course we create civil partnership and award statutory right to fertility treatment for lesbian on the nhs but as my hon friend the member for jarrow say there be long way to go on equal and fair access hope the minister have listen to what she say today and to what she say to the deputy prime minister yesterday and hope progress can be make on this soon rather than later although we have make progress we know that in many respect there be lot to do to stop attitude regress in this country but also internationally woman be hardly notice or recognise in many country and if they be they be certainly not allow to be in sex relationship again thank my hon friend for secure this debate with other in this house hope can play my part in secure great lesbian visibility call the snp spokesperson lesbian visibility week should be about lesbian but the website put up this week say it be about celebrate the power of sisterhood by uplift incredible lgbtqia woman and non binary people think it be real shame that in the week about our visibility the lesbian identity be be subsume into number of other identity that have nothing to do with be same sex attract woman many lesbian fundamentally disagree with this and want to speak up for they today they need someone to speak up for they it be mark of how marginalised lesbian have become in our society that so few hon member have turn up today it be the reason be speak from the snp front bench despite have be remove from it several year ago partly for be the wrong sort of lesbian and one who do not believe that the right of man who say they be woman should trump those of lesbian before go any far declare an interest as supporter of lgb alliance and member of the advisory board of both the lesbian project and sex matters but my main interest in this issue be that be lesbian come out in the when homophobia and lesbophobia be still rife across the uk and my first activism be against clause in those time like many other lesbian be physically assault in the street and mock for be lesbian lesbian of my generation also face lose our job and our child for long time we think that lesbophobia have go but lesbophobia be back and it have be create by those who think that the right of lesbian be conditional on they accept gender identity ideology they be not lesbian be same sex attract woman and we be protect on that basis from discrimination bullying and harassment under the equality act under which our protect characteristic be sexual orientation our protection be on the basis of our sex not our gender and as rowling have say without sex there can be no same sex attraction that be why lesbian like fight the replacement of the biological reality of sex with the nebulous concept of gender say moment ago that the right of lesbian be not conditional on accept gender identity theory that be direct quote from my friend allison bailey as some member will know allison bailey be black lesbian barrister who nearly lose her job for stand up for the right of lesbian other lesbian have face similar persecution my friend kate harris bev jackson and eileen gallagher have to fight lengthy court battle to protect their charity lgb alliance from be remove from the charity register as result of malicious legal action justice prevail and they win the case but shamefully those who seek to destroy charity run by lesbian for lesbian include member of this house and it be not the first time that member of this house have display hostility towards lesbian as the father of the house say moment ago when be invite to speak on cross party panel at the first lgb alliance conference back in october face the challenge of cross picket line that include heterosexual female mp who together with self style trans right activist be protest against the right of lesbian to organise conference to talk about lesbian and gay right just let that sink in that be where we have get to heterosexual tell lesbian that we can not hold conference many lesbian have be persecute for refuse to bend their knee to gender identity ideology some have face lose their job and their livelihood and some have also face violence or the threat of violence will name few of they this afternoon all be or have become my friend as result of our struggle lucy masoud professor kathleen stock julie bindel professor jo phoenix and my dear friend dr shereen benjamin labour activist who have be treat appallingly by the university of edinburgh there be many other lesbian whose life have be severely restrict by gender identity zealot we be not allow to have lesbian only social event the only venue leave for lesbian say that they be inclusive which mean that man be include woman sport be also now inclusive which mean that they include man while exclude lesbian who want to play on woman only team recently lesbian come to view democracy in action at the scottish parliament be tell by security that she could not enter the building wear small pin badge read scottish lesbians be wear that same badge today in solidarity with scottish lesbians which be an excellent grassroots lesbian collective across the united kingdom lesbian have be intimidate at pride march spat on and assault for simply assert their right to say that lesbian be same sex attract at recent event for woman in edinburgh man counter protester hold up vile abusive lesbophobic sign the police do nothing because for all the furore in scotland about hate crime it seem that hate direct at lesbian do not count do not believe that the interest of lesbian be be properly represent by organisation such as stonewall and the organiser of lesbian visibility week because in their determination to promote gender identity ideology and to keep themselves in job by do so not only do they fail to represent lesbian but they actually promote lesbian invisibility and lesbian erasure most people think it be absurd to say that man can be lesbian or to say that lesbian can have penis and they be right it be absurd be proud to be able to stand up in lesbian visibility week in the house of commons and say so be proud that can stand up to speak for the lesbian who reject the forced teaming of lesbian with other group that have completely different issue from we say stop lump we together with those other group as it have the effect that our interest be obscure or overlook altogether and it render we invisible interestingly back in the inclusive britain report find that aggregate term such as bame be no long helpful take no account of the differ need and outcome of those include under that umbrella and should be drop the report finding be adopt and the acronym bame be no long use in government like many other lesbian think that the same principle should be apply to acronym such as so that lesbian be not force team with other identity be reflect on the speech we hear from the hon member for brent central dawn butler and what we could all benefit from in this debate be bit more love and compassion anybody who be set out to do anything other than demonstrate love to people who do or think differently perhaps need to think again yes but there also have to be room for difference and for someone such as to speak up on behalf of some lesbian who feel the way that do we be quite large in number do not pretend to speak for all lesbian but none of the other lesbian in this house speak for all lesbian either be put forward what consider to be valid viewpoint most importantly it be one back by the law of this land be constrain by not have as much time as would have like would have like to have talk about the cass report and how it have identify that large percentage of girl present with gender dysphoria be same sex attract young woman would like to have have time to talk about how important it be that we do not shut down holistic talking therapy for such young woman however be go to bring my comment to close by say this in my belief in the view of many lesbian and in the eye of the law lesbian be woman whose sexual orientation be towards other woman those who think lesbian include man be delude you can not be responsible lawmaker if you believe that any man can be woman just by say so that be an old joke worthy of the bad night in student union bar back in my youth with drunk testosterone fuel man tell and other lesbian that all we need be the right man in future let we try to retain our grasp on what lesbian be many lesbian be sick of be boss about by all those who promote their cult belief that gender trump sex it do not it never have and it never will congratulate my hon friend the member for jarrow kate osborne on secure this debate the first on lesbian visibility week in parliamentary time congratulate she on her inclusion in the diva power list her sharing of she come out story today be generous and powerful she also remind we of all the trailblazer and giant upon whose shoulder we stand she also talk about the homophobic abuse she face on daily basis and applaud she for her courage and insistence that she will not be silence my hon friend the member for brent central dawn butler talk about the importance of everyone be able to be their authentic self be also strike by what my hon friend the member for llanelli dame nia griffith say about how as lesbian we have often be more hidden than she think because for so long lesbian be not notice not consider and marginalise we be not see even when we be not hide as have be say lesbian visibility week be found in by linda riley the publisher of diva magazine it be global event that aim to celebrate woman and non binary people everywhere and to increase lesbian visibility today be an opportunity for we to reflect upon the history of lesbian members of this place to celebrate the progress that have be make to make britain well place in which to live as lesbian and to recognise the issue that our community still face and the progress that be still to be make when be young lesbian role model be few and far between be openly gay be just not something that be present in the public psyche and could not then imagine lesbian be able to exist never mind be happy lesbian visibility week be an opportunity for we to celebrate not only that we exist but that we be diverse community we do not all look like each other behave like each other and agree with each other but more often than not we can be unite although we be not uniform fundamentally you can not tell by look today debate be chance to usualise we and to show that lesbian be everywhere and not in niche discrete community we be in workplace community school church temple synagogue mosque and family and yes we be in parliament too how many time be lesbian expect to blend in keep our head down and not make point of our sexuality and whom we love without be visible our identity be hide and when we be so hidden it confirm assumption that we be somehow shameful that be why lesbian visibility week be so important we must be include for who we be not for fit in once no one look twice at two woman hold hand in public once no one raise an eyebrow when your wife pick you up from work when child teacher be not surprised when two mother arrive for parent evening and when people be not look at the clothe we wear or the length of our hair to decide whether or not we be lesbian that be when lesbian be become equitable it be not so much about be accept as be expect want my be lesbian to be un noteworthy not because no one have notice but because it be usual since today debate be the first in this place to celebrate lesbian visibility week it seem only right to recognise the first out lesbian member of this place maureen colquhoun who die in be one of merely woman elect in the february election not only be she the first woman to come out as lesbian while an mp but she be the first mp to come out at all never meet maureen but she be trailblazer and she never hide who she be even in the face of some of the bad discrimination include from within my party feminist and fierce campaigner for woman right maureen openly state that her sexuality ruin her political career deselecte by her local labour party in northampton north maureen be reinstate by the national executive of the labour party just before the election but ultimately she lose her seat as the country go to the poll maureen rightly take her place in labour party history and parliamentary history and be proud that we be able to celebrate she

be legalise same sex marriage and in dominica homosexual activity have be decriminalise and the age of consent equalised but there be challenge too in russia display the pride flag have become criminal offence and in uganda simply identify as be illegal show just how far there be still to go for people include lesbian to feel safe to be who they be there be still many disparity and discrimination here at home the government can not seem to decide whether or not to bring forward bill to ban conversion therapy two week ago it be report that the prime minister be kill it off but week later it be say that the minister for women and equalities be still work on it the position change depend on whoever be last ask the fact remain that the government be still kick bill on conversion therapy into the long grass with no expectation that it will make it on to the statute book during this parliament despite its being promise six year and four tory prime ministers ago inequality have soar under the conservatives fourteen year of low growth and their reckless gamble which cost household thousand have affect everyone but woman include lesbian have be brutally expose to the cost of living crisis thank to complete failure to close the gender pay gap and failure to create work environment that work for woman with caring responsibility lesbian and people have be let down by conservative government that kill off their own lgbt action plan disband their lgbt advisory panel cancel their international lgbt conference and have still not honour their promise to ban the insidious practice of conversion therapy instead of stand up for right and bring people together the conservatives have stoke culture war and pit different group against each other when labour leave

chamber ahead of that debate remember member receive email and letter from people almost suggest that if we extend marriage to lesbian and gay couple the sky would fall in the next day well we do it and the sky be still up there what notice though be that very quickly everybody be wait for their invitation to an equal marriage reception turn now to the issue of hate crime we need to ensure that we all call hate crime out and be glad that hon member have do so be in regular discussion with my colleague in the home office and will continue to raise the point that hon member have mention today the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry talk about the voice of lesbian be silence simply can not understand why anybody would want to do that lesbian have as much right as anyone to stand up for recognition and for their right it be important that we all enter this challenging debate in calm and measure way toxic debate serve no one we can have grow up debate in which we disagree and agree but we should do so with dignity and with respect as my hon friend the member for south ribble katherine fletcher say this should all be about the people whom we love so let love be at the centre of that debate be glad that colleague raise international issue unacceptable thing be happen around the world in place such as uganda and ghana pay tribute to the work that the all party parliamentary group on global lesbian gay bisexual and transgender right be do to focus attention on this area it be right that we join our lgbt alliance friend around the world to encourage progress in this area so that people do not have to live in fear will address the issue of conversion practice that the hon member for west lancashire ashley dalton mention no one in this country should be harm or harass for who they be and attempt at so call conversion practice be abhorrent we be clear on our stance that they be harmful and that they simply do not work that be why we be committed to publish the draft bill know that it have take time but it have be very challenging issue to get right be committed to our do it gently say that be slightly disappoint by the shadow minister conclusion to her speech try to make out that this government have not work hard on lgbt issue be proud to serve in government who introduce equal marriage proud to serve in government who have bring about an hiv action plan to eradicate new infection by proud to serve in government who allow gay man to donate blood and proud to serve in government who instigate the lgbt veteran independent review so that there can be more support for those who be treat so disgracefully today though will end on positive note by again thank the hon member for jarrow for secure this debate

place where lesbian be give the opportunity to thrive and live safe and happy life call kate osborne to wind up thank all those who have contribute to the debate today thank the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine who be no long in her place for all that she do to ensure that same sex marriage be achieve my huge thank go to my hon friend the member for brent central dawn butler for her continuous support and allyship and to my hon friend the member for llanelli dame nia griffith hope that have pronounce her constituency correctly for her activism and her very moving contribution today it be disappointing to hear the snp front bench spokesperson the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry use problematic language such as deluded and force team in debate design to celebrate all lesbian to bring so much hate and toxicity as the formal front bench speaker be upsetting and this parliament deserve well on point of order madam deputy speaker order the hon member for jarrow kate osborne must really not use such language think she should withdraw that comment be not sure which bit you would like to withdraw madam deputy speaker the bit refer to hate language okay withdraw it but it be astonishing to claim that lesbian visibility week be marginalise lesbian it be because of lesbian visibility week that we be here in this chamber bring to parliament the issue that lesbian face the reality be that trans inclusive lesbian like be very much in the majority of cis lesbian so take offence at any insinuation that be marginalise or misrepresent lesbian as cis lesbian will not shy away from my trans inclusive lesbianism and feminism this year theme be unified not uniform to embrace that we should all be celebrate the wonderful diversity among the spectrum of woman thank the minister for his constructive contribution and his support for the lgbtqia community and look forward to receive his response regard ivf also thank labour front bench spokesperson for set out that labour will treat all people fairly and with dignity and respect question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the importance of lesbian visibility week and believe lgbtqia woman and non binary people should be recognise for the work they do and the joy they bring buckland review of autism employment beg to move that this house have consider the recommendation of the buckland review into autism and employment and urge the government business and the wide economy to implement they there in the word of the motion lie the force of the review that have the honour of chairing and the report that be publish at the end of february this be never go to be bout of navel gazing an inward look report that purely view the challenge that face autistic people in get full or part time job as problem risk or challenge but instead massive opportunity not just for all of we who be involve and who have spend year campaign for or care about autistic people and the wide neurodiverse family but the wide economy business small medium and large and self employment the question of productivity in our economy have be at the heart of the economic debate for more year than care to remember there be the issue of economic inactivity we need to move away from the rather tired and clichéd argument that view this through the prism of benefit rather than the range of talent that autistic people have the myriad condition that be involve and the potential that autistic people want to realise in happy and healthy workplace put on record my thank to stephen lismore and the team of civil servant in the department for work and pensions some of whom be here today for their tireless work and support in marshal the wealth of evidence that we receive both write evidence and evidence from number of roundtable that we hold during our call for evidence in person and online which allow people from right across the four nation of the uk to take part the list of organisation business and people who help to make the review such rich and stimulating process run to seven page at the back of the document that tell the house how deep we want to go and how meaningful we want to make the process the review be robustly independent and we pull no punch on the limitation of government programme but the dwp deserve my thank for its dedication and support be also thankful for the support of the uk lead research charity on autism autistica and of james cusack and the team there remember that the leadership of that organisation be themselves autistic people that be important for on many level the review have to be lead by autistic people and about autistic people in other word nothing about we without we speak not only as parliamentarian and former minister but as parent of young woman who will in due course face choice and hopefully be able to have job of her own some people will say well he only in it because he care about his daughter be in it because care about the hundred of thousand of people like she who deserve their chance they might not be at the top of the tree in term of their ability they might not be able to get job in and the security service which by the way be really come to rely on the gift that autistic people have it be about job right across the spectrum down to part time job that will mean so much to the people who can do they and will give their life purpose fulfilment and happiness we must not lose the concept of happiness in all this there be moral case to be make for the recommendation in the review but there be also make no apology for this hard edge economic case what be good for autistic people will be good for the rest of our society thank my right hon and learn friend for his excellent speech and his brilliant report do he agree that hospitality be an excellent sector for people with learn difficulty autism and so on to consider and will he join on visit to the fair shot café extend the invitation to everyone in the chamber it be social enterprise run by brilliant young woman bianca tavella who set up the organisation to train young people with learn difficulty to become barista and café worker and have secure job for dozen of people will he join one day in covent garden to visit the fair shot café if there be tea and cake involve be there will happily do that the point that my hon friend make deal straight away with the stereotype that autistic people can not socialise that be nonsense there be myriad type of presentation the condition will sometimes present itself in that way but not always plenty of autistic people can and do work in the hospitality sector in an outward face communication base job that work really well for they explode some of those myth be important not just in this house but from an employer point of view that be really at the heart of the report turn risk into opportunity for employer to get they to think differently the term of reference refer to autism but reassure people who initially want wide reference to diversity that that be not forget at all in fact lot of the recommendation have direct read across to wide range of neurodiverse condition from attention deficit disorder to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder dyslexia and dyspraxia the whole family of neurodiverse condition there be clearly commonality in the challenge that people face with recruitment and retention in the time that have which have to use economically let we start with some of the fact that we uncover only just under three in autistic adult be in full time or part time work it be the low rate across all disability class at about as oppose to for those with disability generally in late lead backbench business committee debate on autism in this chamber think it be the first debate on autism that we have ever have in the main chamber then few than one in seven maybe about of autistic adult have full time employment there would seem to have be an improvement but we be not compare like with like in the year since we have see people in the workforce start to reveal their autism in way that they would not have before which be encouraging but let we not forget that we be still talk about the or so who have diagnosis large number of people probably hundred of thousand or even more perhaps do not have diagnosis and do not even think of themselves as autistic or neurodiverse in any way the figure therefore start to get little unclear progress have be very very slow there be no doubt that as result of government action and intervention there have be improvement but we be still nowhere near where we need to be the question be how we start to move the dial more on that shortly autistic people have the large pay gap of all disability group they receive third less on average than non disabled people be afraid that that be the experience of autistic graduate too who experience the bad outcome of all disability group they be the most likely to be overqualifie for their job they be the most likely to be on zero hour contract or part time that lead to under motivation less pay unhappiness and lack of fulfilment some of manager express discomfort with the idea of have autistic people in their workforce and only of autistic employee be fully open about be autistic my right hon and learn friend be make an excellent case recently attend worcestershire local enterprise partnership presentation at which an employer talk about find that his expectation of employ autistic people be completely wrong when he discover that one of his employee be autistic his whole organisation learn and benefit as result it strengthen the organisation and increase its productivity do my right hon and learn friend agree that many more employer need to engage on this subject story like that can open up whole new way of thinking to employer that be really the beginning of the recommendation that we make in the report the power of narrative and link that to create wave of change lie at the heart of the recommendation let make final point about the current situation about two disabled people say that their access to work claim take over three month and say that it take over six month while access to work be great principle that be clearly too slow to help change the life of people who face an immediate job offer or have an interview within day rather than week or month what be to be do have talk about turn risk into opportunity but universal by design approach will make the most difference we have hear lot over the year about autism friendly environment and go out of our way to reach out understand and allow people to explain but that will have only limited impact and only on those people who be comfortable talking and prepare to talk about their autism surely it would be well to have universal change to the way in which we recruit and retain employee so that it embrace not just those with diagnosis but those who do not want to disclose their diagnosis or do not have one suddenly the number would then be not but probably well over million and that might be conservative estimate what about the recommendation there be several group within our recommendation but they can be summarise in the following way the first group of three recommendation relate to initiative to raise awareness reduce stigma and capitalise on productivity we be already work with people autism organisation and employer face organisation to start that national campaign with good news story like the one that we hear from my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker in certain job autistic staff can be way more productive than neurotypical staff statistic show productivity improvement range from to be grateful to autistica for its work promote its new neurodiversity employer index which will allow employer to measure themselves against good practice it have an annual award programme that be the sort of approach that we have see really make difference in other walk of life the index with the support and approval of my hon friend the minister would give employer degree of certainty and uniform framework within which we could see the dial start to move by develop such small pilot and good practice we be again use show and tell method and large national and multinational organisation and representative body can then start to spread this work out the second bucket of recommendation to relate to the support need for autistic people to begin or return to career that be all about make sure that new programme such as the universal support programme be design in way that meet the vary need of autistic people so that there be support employment programme available as well as support internship which the evidence show be wonderful route through which autistic young people can develop the skill that they need be glad that the department for education be pilot an entry route into support internship for disabled people without an education health and care plan that again embrace the universal by design approach as chairman of the education committee completely agree with my right hon and learn friend on the value of support internship do he agree that more broadly we need to look at the issue of people without an ehcp we know that many autistic people do not require or have not have one we should be look to make supported internship or extra support for apprenticeship as accessible as possible so that people can progress into work and training my hon friend be right about that he might have note the very interesting finding of the nuffield trust few week ago which make the point that although we have to have system of diagnosis the ehcp system which be proud to support as back bencher when we bring in the children and families act be very narrow funnel it take long time to get child and people in instead of concentrate on the funnel we need more universal approach that can embrace many people who will not need an ehcp but who have particular need that be why promote cross industry autism support group and opportunity for work shadow and volunteering have to be part of the solution as recommendation say apprenticeship be key finally recommendation be that the government work with autism charity and other group to ensure that more people know about access to work and improvement to the speed of that programme if the adjustment passport and the access to work plus pilot be run by department for work and pensions produce positive result then say to the minister let we roll they out nationally as soon as possible the next group of recommendation to be all about change recruitment practice to support autistic applicant appropriately we need to start with career adviser in school and college and the national careers service in england and its equivalent in wales scotland and northern ireland so that there be well understanding of autism autistic customer can be well support and more properly tailor advice can be give we also need to increase the rigour of the disability confident work and develop high level we need more assessment under disability confident and we need to build in link to the new neurodiversity employer index so that disability confident organisation themselves will be in the eye of autistic jobseeker much well place to help they online support with the employee health and disability service can also link employee to appropriate advice on good practice when it come to recruitment the representative body have role here the recruitment employment confederation have key role to play because it can advise not only individual business but recruitment consulting agency there be myriad agency up and down our high street that do the heavy lifting of recruitment for small and medium sized enterprise so we have to get into those agency it will be good for they as it mean they will have more success in place autistic employee and it will of course be good for wide business let we face it these sme do not have big human resource department and they will not be able to do that themselves that be why get into the agency will be important we must also not forget the self employ and ensure that we identify source of information and support for people who want to get on with thing on their own and set up their own business in the few minute have leave will mention two more group of recommendation will be very brief madam deputy speaker but want to finish cover this important report support autistic people already in the workforce be cover in recommendation to work with the chartered institute of personnel and development to make sure that the neurodiversity at work guidance be publish and accessible be at the heart of that finally on career progression we need to promote the value of employee resource group and support network within large organisation and work with autism charity and the representative body to develop the training package to allow autistic staff to progress new task group will be set up in the week ahead say week because be work with colleague in the dwp to identify an independent chair and suitably qualified member we need to monitor progress hold government to account and audit the progress we be make want to see certainly by the end of this decade that number of one in three up to the disability average at least and who that let we be ambitious here call upon my hon friend the minister to respond positively to the report and its recommendation with all the power that she can muster on behalf of herself and her government colleague they be not the end they be not even the beginning of the end but they be the end of the beginning let we make progress be very pleased to follow the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland congratulate he on secure this debate and on the report which make very valuable contribution on this extremely important topic the report do good job of lay bare the obstacle face autistic people in the workplace obstacle that as he rightly say we need to overcome applaud the obvious passion that he have show in present the report to we do not know about his own family link and be grateful to he for explain that to we the work and pensions committee have recently launch our own inquiry into disability employment to follow up the report that we publish in on the disability employment gap we have just close our call for evidence for that inquiry be glad that we have receive evidence from autistica among other and we will soon start to take oral evidence from disability charity and other the review will help we to frame particular question on autism employment in the context of that inquiry as the review point out the employment gap be much bad for autistic people than for disabled people more broadly disappointing feature of the report for though be the rather unambitious nature of the recommendation which be along the line of the government ought to try bit hard on this and do bit more of that there be no target set out in the report and nothing to help we to monitor progress fear that when in two or five year time we ask whether the recommendation have be deliver the answer will be bit unclear do not blame the right hon and learn member for south swindon for that no doubt ministers would not have go along with high level of ambition but fear that the government will be able to accept all the recommendation without really change anything it do seem to be bit of miss opportunity the report rightly highlight the huge size of the autism employment gap by how much should we aim to reduce it in his speech moment ago the right hon and learn gentleman suggest that the aim should be to increase the rate of employment among people with autism at least up to the overall disability employment rate that would have be really substantial target against which to measure progress to include in the report but it be not in there my fear be that lack of ambition have regrettably mark the government effort on disability employment for some time there be moment not long ago when high level of ambition be announce government members may well remember that they campaign in the general election on target announce by david cameron to halve the wide disability employment gap that gap fall sharply from to through the new deal for disabled people but it have be stick at around percentage point ever since it go down for bit after but perhaps unsurprisingly during the pandemic it go back up unfortunately the target of halve the gap be abandon shortly after the election be safely win which strike as the kind of move that give politician bad name in our report the work and pensions committee call unanimously on cross party basis for that target to be reinstate the report we be debate this afternoon refer in paragraph to make progress on close the employment gap and call on the government in respond to that report to set an ambitious target for increase the employment rate among people with autism perhaps as the right hon and learn member for south swindon have just suggest up to at least the overall disability employment rate as the right hon and learn gentleman spell out with passion in his foreword at the moment we be miss out on the skill and energy that autistic people could be contribute to the detriment of we all he be absolutely right about that the danger fear be that without target against which to measure progress the report may not really change thing be grateful to the right hon gentleman for engage so closely absolutely agree that without means of accountability the work that we have do may well be lose think that the task group will play an important role it will have the freedom to start develop some more hard and fast approach where necessary and to hold the government foot to the fire whatever that government complexion hope that give the right hon gentleman some reassurance be grateful to the right hon and learn gentleman for that intervention perhaps he could use his influence with the task group do not know whether he be member of it be not sure how that will work out but be sure he will have influence with it to urge it to adopt the target that he set out few minute ago which think could make substantial difference welcome the call in the report for process and support mechanism that enable autistic staff to be recruit and to succeed in that context want to draw attention to concept that be not mention in the report be bit disappointed that it be not but which have be refer to elsewhere not least in our select committee report the concept of job carving mean assess person skill and then tailor an employee role to those skill catherine hale director of the chronic illness inclusion project tell our inquiry that job carving be particularly effective in support people with learn disability give the big overlap between autism and learning disability think that job carving could certainly help the charity mind say that job carving role for people with learn disability can benefit employer by remove task from other employee and free up time in its working better report the equality and human rights commission describe job carving as flexible way of manage workforce which allow employer to utilise their staff skill in the most productive way whilst enable disabled people to make valuable contribution to the world of work our report call on the government as part of their then forthcoming national disability strategy to provide detailed guidance to employer and provider of employment support on how they could job carve role for disabled people and call on jobcentre plus to encourage local employer in their area to job carve the government response to our report do not pick up the concept of job carving but ministers could still pick it up in respond to the report we be debate this afternoon wonder whether the minister who know take very close interest in this area recognise that job carving could make significant difference to the employment prospect of many autistic people one thing the government response to our inquiry do refer to be the plan at that time to increase the number of place on the intensive personalise employment support scheme ipes provide voluntary employment support to people with disability and complex barrier to employment as we note in our report the guidance to ipes provider explicitly mention job carving as an intervention that can help disabled people to find and stay in work ipes be refer to in paragraph of the right hon and learn gentleman report which rightly point out that referral to ipes have now end as our select committee hear in one off evidence session last week on the government back to work plan there will be no more ipes referral we be tell by provider at our evidence session last week that the work and health programme also refer to in paragraph of the report be also come to an end those be two programme that the report rightly identify as provide valuable help for people with autism to move into employment which be be shut down the minister may want to comment on this in due course but as far as can tell it do not appear that any of the new employment support programme such as workwell and universal support will provide support comparable to that which be be close down and which the report have rightly identify as very helpful the fear be that despite the laudable aim set out in the report which know the minister will endorse we be in reality go backwards the provision at the moment which have be there for some time be be remove it would be helpful if the minister could tell we why ipes and the work and health programme be be close down and where the new initiative be to close what look like an emerge gap in provision for people with autism employer be struggle at the moment to fill vacancy the right hon and learn member for south swindon be absolutely right that there be big opportunity here to boost disability employment if we can just find way to enable employer to tap into it the hon member for worcester mr walker be absolutely right that employer be willing to do so if only they know how it be bit of close book to they do not think there be lack of willingness on the part of employer but there be lack of information it be very interesting to read in the right hon and learn gentleman review about auticon which have not hear of before it be an it consultancy in which of the workforce be autistic highly talented it consultant the founder think they be in scandinavia recognise that many autistic adult have extraordinary ability such as pattern recognition sustained concentration and attention to detail which be valuable quality in many employment context however autistic people need support to secure and maintain those job and auticon specifically provide that support understand the need of its employee and have build successful business on that basis be glad that the report also highlight in that respect the good work of gchq which be big employer in my neck of the wood another example along those line be an it security company in worcester call titania its chief executive be an autistic woman and it have tailor its recruitment process specifically to address some of the challenge that my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland have identify in his report so that it can recruit more autistic people who it find be such valuable and productive employee that sound like wonderful model the more of that kind of initiative around the country the well the report make the point that line manager in mainstream business may well not know that somebody they be manage be autistic whether the employer can agree reasonable adjustment for the employee as be their right under the equality act will depend on they self disclose their diagnosis to their line manager as the review note whatever the level of understanding among company director or senior staff if the line manager be unable or unwilling to provide support the employee will struggle to stay in their job the review be right to point out that at the moment there be no easily accessible guidance for employer and line manager on how to support autistic staff evidence to our inquiry so far suggest that as the hon member for worcester rightly say employer want to do the right thing but often simply do not know how when they be point in the right direction and try it it turn out to be positive experience what can the government do to give employer confidence in this area the review call on the department to continue to develop disability confident increase the rigour of developmental work need to achieve the high disability confident level think that be very kind way of express the point the noble lord shinkwin who sit on the government benches in the other place and chair the disability commission for the centre for social justice speak for many of our witness when he say that disability confident be not make measurable impact at the moment employer can as thing stand achieve the high level of disability confident accreditation without employ single disabled person in response to our predecessor select committee six year ago the department say that it be develop proposal for an evaluation of disability confident that commitment first express six year ago be announce again in response to our report almost three year ago in november however have still see no sign of anything happen perhaps the minister can update we be that evaluation of disability confident now complete and when can we expect disability confident finally to be reform the review be absolutely right to highlight the importance of access to work and to call for improvement there it make the point think the right hon and learn member for south swindon refer to this in his speech that almost two third of disabled people state that it take over three month for their application to be process and say that it take over six month he be absolutely right that that be far too slow agree that as the review suggest if the adjustment passport produce positive result it should be roll out nationally as soon as possible however in response to our committee report three year ago in november we be promise that the adjustment passport would be pilot from november and if successful would be expand to support all access to work customer as far as can tell we seem to be no far forward in than we be in november when be these long promise improvement actually go to materialise one other policy lever the government could pull be mandatory disability workforce reporting which be recommend unanimously on cross party basis in our report there be voluntary framework through which employer can choose to report but in late the government launch consultation on whether to require large employer to report the number of disabled people they be employ that work be then pause but understand that it have now be resume and that the government plan to publish their finding and next step in the course of this year wonder whether the minister can update we on when we can expect to see that work do she agree that require employer to report on the number of disabled people they employ and within that perhaps the number of autistic people could be effective in encourage the employment of people with autism and other health impairment very much welcome the report which have highlight important issue and the opportunity to debate it today also welcome the positive approach that the right hon and learn gentleman take when introduce the report early in see the scale of opportunity if we get this right however laudable aspiration in this area be just not enough if delivery be delay for year we need an ambitious target to increase the rate of employment among people with autism and other disabled people we need work up plan and timescale to deliver they very much hope that perhaps as result of the work of the task group that he mention we will finally see some of that when the government respond formally to this very welcome report call the snp spokesperson thank you madam deputy speaker run through my mind be the word follow that thank the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland for produce this outstanding report his family live experience have absolutely make for much well report and thank he for all the work that he have do on it to follow the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms be always privilege and pleasure he have take away some of my good line but will carry on regardless it be real pleasure to speak in the debate which sign up for immediately have speak many time in this place on the subject of autism think it would be remiss of not to mention dame cheryl gillan at the start of my remark one of the first debate that speak in be on the closure of the autism one stop shop in motherwell back in and dame cheryl be so kind and helpful to when speak to that important topic should point out that be very close to someone with three autistic son my own young son have never be diagnose but do not think there be much doubt that he be somewhere on the spectrum and think he would admit that himself also thank ambitious about autism and the national autistic society for their briefing which be always helpful the current situation regard employment for those with autism be simply not good enough across the uk the uk government have consistently bang on about reduce economic inactivity and encourage people into work but their rhetoric be still not match with proper support especially for the neurodiverse about whom we be talk today as we have hear issue with access to work and the provision of workplace adjustment mean that many autistic people be slip through the gap this be certainly the case for those with autism as we have also hear only three in working age autistic people in the uk be in employment that statistic be five in for all disabled people and eight in for non disabled people ambitious about autism employment survey find that of those unemployed would like to be in work but less than third be confident that they would find work within the next year that signify huge gap in the support currently provide have see at first hand the transformative power of employment when autistic and disabled people be properly support into work have the privilege of visit university hospital wishaw to meet some of the participant in the support internship scheme run by dfn project search and meet some of the student on that scheme some of they have now find employment some of they have now marry the transformation in their life and those of their family can not be estimate literally have to be drag off the scene because that be one of the most uplifting visit have undertake as an mp employment bring fulfilment independence and purpose and as have say it can positively transform the life of the employee if they be well support however even when employ autistic people face challenge and discrimination the buckland report find that autistic worker face the large pay gap of all disability group earn on average third less than their non neurodiverse counterpart far the report note that autistic graduate be twice as likely as non disabled graduate to be unemployed after month only find work in that period and autistic graduate be more likely to be overqualifie for the job they have they be the most likely people to be on zero hour contract and the least likely to be in permanent role all of those thing require look at properly because the statistic be appal morally we should be ensure that autistic worker be support when try to find employment but it be also incumbent upon government employer and other stakeholder to ensure that those with autism be adequately support when they be in work the snp welcome the publication of the buckland review of autism and employment and urge the government to implement its recommendation to ensure that autistic people have the opportunity they deserve far welcome the report engagement with autistic organisation as live experience be vital when shape policy that be something the uk government do not always have good track record on lack of access to good quality career advice inflexible hiring practice and non inclusive workplace culture be just some of the barrier face autistic people once employment have be achieve autistic people can struggle when employer do not or can not put in place proper adjustment to support they autistic people process information differently and experience build environment in totally different manner which can impinge on their ability to carry out their work too much bright light noise or social interaction can be overwhelming additionally as have be say autistic people might need more time to process interview question it be imperative that employer be aware of such difference and take step to accommodate autistic worker or any disabled worker for that matter person close to have an autistic son who wear badge at work to indicate his mood to his co worker it be simple thing if he be feel overwhelmed and do not want people to talk to he or to be interrupt he turn the badge to indicate that from my own experience in further education know that my student benefit immensely when we have autistic student in class at first they think it be strange they be bit wary but over the year they develop an understanding of autism and real respect for the autistic student who sit next to they the same happen in workplace if we can get people into the right place and the right job everyone benefit not accommodate autistic worker waste so much talent and skill it make no sense for business either we have already hear about the special skill that autistic people can bring to the workplace when business properly accommodate neurodiverse employee the result can be amazing have visit the barclays bank campus in glasgow design by woman architect who have autistic son the difference in that building be awesome it be build with neurodiverse people in mind with big open plan office with chill pod and real understanding of what need to happen as result barclays have great employee and people be get good work and proper job it be imperative that the uk government act urgently to improve support for all disabled people include those with autism and tackle barrier to employment we be really worried about the prime minister recent announcement on fit note reform push people into work without consider what they be suffer and what they need be appalling as you know madam deputy speaker get very passionate about this topic so will try to rush through it be important that access to work be reform as the buckland report call for and reform to sick pay also need to be introduce for when people need time off in scotland the snp government try our good we be try to be fair work nation and be invest money in autism as well as in simple thing such as work within education to get initial teacher education course that will teach trainee teacher about autism because as we know education be the gateway to employment will stop there madam deputy speaker again congratulate the right hon and learn member for south swindon and want the minister to take on board all the report recommendation and make life much easy for those with autism in the workplace call the shadow minister be the next in line to congratulate the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland on securing and open this debate but also and particularly on the content of his report his persistence in push to raise awareness of the barrier autistic people face in employment be greatly to his credit and benefit this house and our understanding of these issue also thank the backbench business committee for grant the debate and colleague for make such valuable and insightful contribution in pass also put on record my admiration for autism together formerly the wirral society for autistic children great local charity that have be around for year and do very good work in this area which have not always be fashionable for people to concentrate on as we have hear this afternoon the buckland review have be broadly welcome by charity and other organisation it have shine light on the barrier that neurodivergent people continue to face when try to get into stay in and get on in the workplace it have also demonstrate that there be an increase understanding of the benefit of ensure that people with neurodivergence can get into work they often have unique view and unique talent not only do gchq know about those talent but many other sector could benefit if they only realise it the review be fill with statistic that make for grim reading to say the least only of autistic adult be currently in work what waste where they be in work autistic people face the large pay gap of all disability group that be simply not fair reflection of the benefit they bring to employment autistic graduate be the most likely to be overqualifie for their position and least likely to be in permanent role our society and our economy suffer as result of the waste that the buckland review have outline to the house we ought to be anxious to do something about that the review highlight that startling of manager feel uncomfortable with the idea of hire disabled people let we imagine someone want to work but be prevent from do so because the hiring manager feel uncomfortable around they do not understand the way in which they relate to the world or have preconceive idea about their ability that be pure discrimination it be not always deliberate but it must feel like it whether it be suffer because of benign ignorance or bigotry we must think about how to get rid of the ignorance that the report talk about and we must give neurodivergent people the confidence that the law will support they if they be subject to bigotry the right hon and learn gentleman report talk very much about the soft power end of tackle that but we also have to think as society about the hard end we have discrimination law in place for people with disability perhaps we need to think about how to give that more bite admit that the right hon and learn gentleman have not do that in his review and it probably be not in the term of reference but it be important to remember that context when consider this issue we simply can not let generation after generation of very talented people be waste in this way the review key recommendation be only first step on the road to eliminate some of the barrier the right hon and learn gentleman know that although he be appropriately passionate about what he discover in his review undoubtedly many of the recommendation have the potential to have positive impact on autistic people experience and open up those important vista of opportunity for they in our society the review rightly have strong focus on collaborate with autistic people employer employer organisation and specialist support group that be important because there be unique insight to be have clearly the right hon and learn gentleman report have do that very well for example shadow minister for disabled people my hon friend the member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft go to an event attend by bt few month ago to highlight how to improve its hiring practice and workplace support for neurodivergent people she tell that bt speak highly not only of the positive benefit feel by autistic employee but of how the company have be able to capitalise on the unique skill that they bring there be many example of that some of which we have hear today the review have be largely welcome but we must ask how quickly it can be implement and whether we can give it bit more bite the right hon and learn gentleman be very gentle in his way and no doubt he have be send down particular railroad by the government in produce his report what step will the minister take to ensure that other neurodivergent and disabled people benefit from measure similar to those outline in the review what can she say to back up the remark make by the chair of the select committee my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms about increase the predictability and speed of access to work make it easy for people to know that they will be support in practical way if they make the step into work over the last few year the government have bring hodgepodge patchwork of piecemeal measure claim to strengthen and improve the right of disabled and neurodivergent people there have be lot of activity but very little effective output in term of change in the number of people with disability in work we have the national disability strategy which be largely view as tinker around the edge we have the health and disability white paper which raise more question than it answer we have the disability action plan again smattering of well receive small policy idea as my right hon friend the member for east ham point out we have the dropping of the target for increase employment of disabled people more generally we have have consultation after consultation pilot and various heart and mind initiative with employer but little have change as we have see in the buckland review we need proper action not more gentle observation we need to deal with the societal barrier that make the life of people with neurodiversity challenging and their employment prospect far too narrow on inclusion measure there be contradiction that strike when listen to the right hon and learn gentleman between the bleak picture that the review paint of the continue barrier that autistic people face while try to get into work and some of the other attitude that can be discern in the government about how to deal with that the minister for women and equalities the right hon member for saffron walden kemi badenoch be on the record say that equality diversity and inclusion measure have already go too far dismiss they as snake oil and performative and deride disability equality and inclusion measure in the economy as woke and something to be eliminate and drive out that send confusing and mixed message about the government approach hope that the minister response will include far more positive approach tell we that the government intend to do something about the review hope that they will take up some of the issue that my right hon friend the member for east ham raise in his contribution about target rather than nice word and warmth which we all agree with we want target and commitment to practical action not just repeat of the issue about disability confident employer as my right hon friend say in his remark analysis show that disabled people do not report well experience work for disability confident employer compare with employer that be not part of the scheme an employer can say that they be disability confident without employ single disabled person be it not time for target and transparency about the number of people with disability who be in work be it not time for reporting more rigour and if need be an application of the law thank my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland for introduce this important debate on autism employment it be pleasure to follow the lesbian visibility week debate have the pleasure of hear dame kelly holmes talk about how it have change her life at an inspiring leadership awards this week let take the opportunity to put on record our covenant that cover disadvantaged girl and vulnerable young woman thank the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows for mention dame cheryl gillan pay tribute to her passion and commitment in championing autism and its opportunity and understanding of the individual which be so important my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon also do that so well firmly believe that autism should not be barrier to start stay or succeed in employment know that all member present and those watch share that vision although not every autistic person can work give the right long term support not just to get into work but to progress in work the vast majority could one in people be autistic which be about million people across the uk give more autistic people the chance to get into work be incredibly good for they as we hear from my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon today there be huge opportunity to tackle economic inactivity the talent range and myriad potential must be realise and will do my utmost today to give an update on many of the question raise and what come next we know it be good for employer in build that diverse workforce to work with more diverse customer in my role in answer to the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle it be about proper inclusion and action and turn warm word not just from but from employer and sector into action can promise she that there have be no railroading on what my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon should include in his review will come on to the next step and there will also be further update on the disability action plan in july hopefully we be start off well in answer question in the government set goal to see million more disabled people in employment by be proud to say that in the first quarter of the number of disabled people in employment have increase by million mean that the goal have be meet within five year in the first quarter of disability employment have rise by million in total since the goal be announce be aware that progress have be good but not even feel this week be under scrutiny again from the chair of the select committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms be focus on this next goal and how we review and shape what be next member should watch this space it be sad but true as we have hear today that currently only three in working age autistic people be in employment even though we know that the majority of autistic people would like to be in work indeed their family would love to see they progress my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon say the dial need to be move on autism and diversity more widely and we do need to move that dial the design we be work on for universal support and engagement with the department for education whether that be supportive internship or broad apprenticeship have to work for young people and the people in our community seven in working age autistic people be unable to access independence and the sense of fulfilment that employment can bring be far too many as the minister hear the right hon and learn gentleman suggest few minute ago that there should be target for raise the level of employment among autistic people at least up to the wide disability employment rate will she consider adopt that target be absolutely look at the right way forward because for if someone acquire disability we need to be look at how they be retain in work and whether they have particular impairment or need be look at that in the round as part of the disability confident challenge the new guidance for leadership work with the cipd be important we need to be talent confident many employer want to employ more inclusively they just struggle with how to do it and so regress to the same old recruitment there be also an autism friendly employer award which we should be look at be proud to say that have that be one of the few parliamentarian who do it be worth raise that too thank the hon lady for raise that important point for all of we my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken mention the fair shot café in covent garden think we will all be pop down for coffee and banana cake my predecessor enjoy his visit there and be look forward to see more work like that because these thing be incredibly important the chair of the select committee the right hon member for east ham talk about job carving and call it job design it be about work with employer look at the role they have interview in the way that suit people and give long term support totally agree with all the charity that talk about jobcentre always have that individualised approach promise the hon member for motherwell and wishaw and all those watch that it be about the right role for the right person in front of we at dwp so that we can actively change people life that be what we be in the business of do it be not just warm word the point on self employment that my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon mention link to the lilac review and active positive choice for disabled people we recognise talent ability and entrepreneurship there be positive choice there and access to cash be important will turn to my right hon and learn friend point on autistic people and the recruitment process thank helen tomlinson the government menopause champion who be also the head of talent at the adecco group thank to her support my official be work with adecco and the recruitment and employment confederation to develop new method for recruitment that work effectively for both autistic and neurotypical applicant ensure that employer be more able to secure the talent they need to thrive the government be determined to provide the right support also note and agree with the point about career progression for autistic people access to work continue to provide grant for extra cost and those adjustment passport be key we be focus on new employment recognise that there have be delay and that be partly because more people know and understand the value of access to work we be continue to develop universal support scheme recognise the point that the right hon member for east ham have make and hope have reassure he about the design on that can not cover all the wide range point he make in this debate but be happy to write to he on those on the challenge of be ambitious and on what come next and in term of what we be look to achieve can announce that my official will shortly be go out to the autism community to seek expression of interest in join the group start with the role of chair it will be transparent inclusive process and the selection panel will be entirely independent of government fully expect that that be where outcome and what come next will be realise when it come to the review ambition to conclude this report be big and extremely welcome step forward it have not only produce plan to overcome barrier for autistic people but show path that can be follow for other group face barrier to employment and those with other type of neurodiversity and learning thank my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon once again the review make the point about the reform of disability confident can the minister give an update on that have the evaluation be complete when will the change be bring forward there have be some change and have mention some of the update there be more to come which think the right hon gentleman will be interested in and will welcome if he can just bear with if be not constantly in the chamber be examine can get on with the bit that want to bring forward to the house if that make sense to those watch we be see some great progress and some good practice thing always work well when there be real change in get autistic people into employment agree with the hon member for wallasey agree with the whole reason for the report and thank james and the charity and all those who bring the report together we need to deliver for autistic people this be just the start and may we long continue to deliver on that ambition call sir robert buckland to wind up thank you madam deputy speaker will exercise my prerogative because there be proper debate with some challenge to the report and the approach take may first say that make no apology for the fact that the report do not as be so often the case make yet another call for change in the law or ask for another slug of government money just do not think that either will really cut it take the point make by the hon member for wallasey dame angela eagle to talk about the legal framework we have equality legislation and we have protect characteristic namely disability under which autism clearly come fairly and squarely be absolutely with she in make sure that employer and employee be much well equip to understand the full ambit of that and what discrimination actually mean she be right that more often than not discrimination be not the product of deliberate malicious or wilful behaviour but the product of ignorance think that word ignorance underpin so much of the obstacle that autistic people and neurodiverse people face in the workforce now be with the hon lady on wag war on ignorance but may say to opposition members that they should not confuse perhaps diplomatic or gentle approach with lack of inner determination and steel to get change that have always be how have operate do believe in respect and courtesy but underpin that be determination to hold the minister to account and to hold government of future complexion to account that be why the task group have an important role be grateful to the civil servant who work with the minister for share the draft term of reference with the debate can help inform that process far the term of reference which emphasise the independence of the chair and the group be good start we should make it absolutely clear in those term of reference that the group be free to look at target timescale and the sort of approach that have presage in my speech and which the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms rightly press we on let we take that away from the debate as something on which we must build be particularly grateful to the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows for mention dfn project search dfn stand for david forbes nixon who be an incredible man whose own son be autistic with the charity that he set up he have build this incredible network she be right to mention that commend my hon friend the minister for her remark she know that will be hold the government foot to the fire on this matter let we use the review as the basis of progress let we get industry and business behind we and let we move the dial on autism employment let we get on with it question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the recommendation of the buckland review into autism and employment and urge the government business and the wide economy to implement they single use plastics motion make and question propose that this house do now mohindra cheap and disposable single use plastic have become symbol of our throwaway culture they be cheap convenient and now pervade every part of our life but that also mean that they have contaminate every part of our environment where they take century to break down they often break down into tiny microplastic that be have catastrophic impact on biodiversity and human health plastic can be find in ever increase quantity everywhere from the top of mount everest to the deep ocean trench the uk produce the second high amount of plastic waste per capita with supermarket produce tonne of plastic every year at the last count with production increase that figure be set to rise the uk public have long be ahead of politician on this issue and have prove time and again their deep concern for the plastic crisis and their determination to find solution that be highlight most recently in massive citizen science project the big plastic count run by greenpeace and everyday plastic more than individual and schoolchildren agree to count their plastic for week to record the scale of the problem and find out where their waste be be dispose of fifty mp also sign up to take part and be proud to be one of they the project uncover that the uk throw away billion piece of plastic every year but only of that be recycle the vast of it be burn in uk incinerator which be often locate in deprive neighbourhood produce toxic air pollution and often more greenhouse gas per tonne burn than coal that be shocking statistic and large part of why the plastic industry be contribute such huge amount to climate change the industry now produce more greenhouse gas than the entire aviation industry time and again survey have confirm the strength of public feeling when it come to plastic and in particular their frustration with single use plastic study by the university of birmingham early this year find the uk public to be more concerned about the threat to society pose by plastic pollution than the coronavirus pandemic or future pandemic terrorism economic collapse natural disaster or artificial intelligence plastic relate issue top the list of environmental problem that the uk public want to tackle plastic in the ocean be first and the amount produce be second different poll find that of uk resident agree that to stop plastic pollution we need to cut plastic production when we look globally it be clear that the problem have grow out of control global plastic production double between and and it be anticipate nearly to triple by study that come out this week project that the plastic industry will consume to more of the earth remain carbon budget to keep warm below and that be conservative estimate all that mean of course be that we must design solution that be appropriate for the enormity of the problem at hand that mean solution that be global which require international co operation one that force company and government to change their behaviour and one that address plastic pollution across its full life cycle from extraction to disposal as we speak country around the world be attend the fourth round of the united nations negotiation to try to agree plastic treaty but that process currently hang in the balance oil produce country and fossil fuel and chemical company be out in force at the negotiation use all their power resource and wealth to try to obstruct the process and prevent any deal that would put limit on the amount of plastic that get produce for those company the plastic industry represent lifeline as the world look to replace oil and gas as an energy source the global plastic treaty need to secure global legally bind target to cut plastic production radically the liberal democrats be serious about tackle the problem we want to end plastic export by in previous session my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael introduce bill that would have set target to end non essential single use plastic as well as statutory long term target to cut plastic waste and pollution significantly by by phase out all but the most essential use of plastic be deeply concerned that the government target on plastic pollution as set out in the environment act will not be enforce until leave the government year to delay take action we be push for punitive measure for the government if they do not achieve the target while the government say some of the right thing on the plastic treaty we have yet to see confirmation that they will push for genuinely ambitious outcome particularly on plastic production to be clear the government have announce their intention to restrain and reduce plastic production but they must go much far and call for radical target for reduction they also must provide explicit confirmation that such target should be legally binding rather than leave each country to decide voluntarily how much it will do and when and they must confirm that such target should address every single form of plastic production without loophole not just those contain the most harmful and toxic element the absolute priority in the negotiation be that we must stop the problem at source that will make our air clean and our park green space and beach free from plastic it will protect wildlife and biodiversity and help we stay within of global warming although it be crucial to recognise the importance of tackle the issue on global scale would also like to recognise some of the important action we can take at home in my constituency we be incredibly lucky to have the carymoor environmental trust which work to educate child on the impact of waste on the environment it run session call fantastic plastic which look at the environmental impact of plastic and way to avoid single use plastic since the project have work with over child in somerset since carymoor have regenerate acre of cap landfill site into beautiful nature reserve and welcome around school year to its visitor centre where it give advice on use reusable container for drink instead of single use plastic alternative that wonderful example of local educational work need to be supplement by government policy and have be please by some of the government intention their reform extend producer responsibility system will put the full cost of collect sort recycle and disposing of household packaging waste on producer rather than local authority it be step in the right direction despite be hamper by delay mean it will not begin until at least march local authority will also be require to collect flexible plastic and film from household waste by march somerset have be prepare for the introduction of these new waste regulation and recently somerset council have take part in flexible plastic trial as proud serve somerset councillor be very pleased by its success around property around frome in my constituency take part and each household be provide with blue transparent bag in which to present their flexible plastic waste the response have be positive with over of resident regularly participate in the trial just under kg of material be capture each week if we consider the light weight of this type of plastic we get an idea of the sheer volume of it that be use each week the take up of the trial demonstrate that there be an appetite among resident to increase their recycling output and polling from reloop have find that of the british public express very high level of support for recycling however one issue be the uk current lack of suitable recycling infrastructure for flexible plastic they be expensive to recycle and more work be require on the end market side to create the infrastructure to make this type of recycling work assurance from government on the cost and support available for local authority and for industry will help to ensure move in this direction be success return to the recent big plastic count one participate constituent in frome tell that they would use individual piece of single use plastic year and that it be mostly food packaging would like legislation to oblige supermarket to sell more loose food which would dramatically reduce unnecessary plastic waste that would have the twin benefit of cut down on food waste as it would encourage consumer to buy what they need rather than big pre package bag of fruit and veg farmer could also reduce their costly pre farmgate food waste which be create when supermarket mandate certain size for fruit and vegetable to fit into their plastic packaging the liberal democrats have be call for ban on non recyclable single use plastic we want to replace they with affordable alternative aim for complete elimination within three year in my constituency famer have start to look at way in which they can eliminate their usage of single use plastic for example tytherington milk station near frome operate four milk vend machine one at the farm in tytherington one in frome one just outside my constituency in warminster and another in bath supply their customer directly and reduce the farm carbon footprint by reduce plastic waste through the use of refillable glass bottle my constituency be also home to bruton dairy which start to use steel milk churn in bid to cut down the amount of plastic use that have prove so successful that over month period the dairy send out more than litre of milk in its churn innovation and initiative of that kind should be celebrate and support let now turn to an announcement that the government make early today have wait since when they first announce their intention to launch deposit return scheme we have now hear their plan polling for reloop find that of the public support the introduction of deposit return scheme and that believe that the government have at least fair amount of responsibility for recycling despite the lengthy delay welcome the fact that the government have listen to the public along with liberal democrat support for an all in deposit scheme and hope the minister will say little about the scheme in his response however yet again the government be look to move too slowly the scheme be not expect to come into operation until although international good practice have show that month should be sufficient to establish such system it could potentially save about billion give the social cost of litter and give high recycling rate as well as reduce greenhouse gas emission by million tonne year by in the light of those benefit it be vital for the government to move fast in deliver this long await scheme be also disappointed that they have fail to honour their manifesto commitment to include glass bottle in such scheme but guess that that promise be make five defra secretaries of state ago the scale of the plastic problem that we face be huge but believe we have the tool at our disposal to tackle it the government have make the right noise but now be the time to act both on the international stage and at home we know of the devastating impact that climate change and plastic pollution have on our environment so we must address it as matter of urgency the government have be slow to act in the past and hope they will now recognise the urgency that be need the uk must take its place as one of the leader in the global movement to reduce our reliance on use plastic and hope that through the successful implementation of the measure have discuss today we will take important step forward thank the hon member for somerton and frome sarah dyke for raise this important issue the government be deal with it and take it extremely seriously we all know of the detrimental impact that
