to regulate the use of national symbol by commercial and other entity the correct use of many national symbol such as royal name state emblem the royal arm and the government coat of arm be already subject to government regulation think many people would be quite angered by the way certain national organisation have try to change our national flag the cross of st george and the union jack be it not time that we protect and cherish our national symbol by appoint minister of the crown from the cabinet office to oversee that will the minister also look at the union flag bill of which would enshrine in legislation the protection of our cherished national flag the union jack should be unifying symbol for the whole country it have look the way it have for the past several hundred year and see no point in mess around with it be not sure that we need legislation we just need some common sense would ministers be equally keen to prevent organisation such as political party use image of his majesty the king in their propaganda do not know how to answer that question if be honest laughter our party have always be proud to use the union jack because we be proud unionist party and we will always be proud to support the royal family charity and voluntary organisations what step her department be take to support charity and voluntary organisation in the context of increase in the cost of living the government be invest million to support charity across england with cost of living pressure and that include the community organisations cost of living fund which be award critical support

last year and will be write to the pfa shortly to seek its assurance on the current working of the fund and how the pfa be engage with former player my constituent be the former celtic chelsea blackburn and more importantly norwich city football legend chris sutton he have recently bring to my attention the very distressing fact that former professional footballer be four time more likely to die of cte chronic traumatic encephalopathy dementia than the wide population due to repeat head impact chris be just one of group of former player who be champion these issue and push for well provision to support the wellbeing of ex player and their family can the minister reassure that the football industry will create properly finance dementia fund to help player and of course their widow who be affect by the cte dementia scandal my hon friend be right to raise this incredibly important issue and want to record my thank to chris sutton and all those involve in this important work we welcome the practical support that those involve in sport give former player in these circumstance the pfa and premier league brain health fund have an initial amount of million in financial support for former player and their family to improve their quality of life the fund will remain in place until the pfa and the premier league establish charity that will involve great many football stakeholder so we can provide much long term support vehicle can reassure he that take this area of work incredibly seriously and will continue to put pressure on those involve be grateful to the minister for that answer and hope we will hear more in that regard the number of child who be vape continue to rise at an alarming rate statistic from show that current use within the last day among year old be but the percentage will obviously be significantly high now we know about some of the harm to which vaping lead which should cause we grave concern but we certainly do not know about all of they in that context do the minister think it be good thing that the strip of football club such as blackburn rovers be sponsor by vape company if not will he join in seek to change that know that there have be many discussion about sponsorship within various sporting body it be for the individual club and the football authority themselves to set guideline of that kind but the hon lady have raise an interesting point and if she will allow will give it further consideration call the shadow minister everyone deserve to feel safe play the sport that they love in the context of sadly too many former professional player suffer from dementia what step be the department take to ensure that sport governing body have the guidance they need to ensure the safety of professional player the

concussion research group to identify the question that still need answering as well as an innovation and technology panel whose member be look at the practical technical solution that will aid safety and mitigate concussion however as have say this be an incredibly important area and one on which we will focus gambling operators levy what her plan timetable be for respond to the consultation on the statutory levy on gambling operator the statutory levy represent generational change in funding arrangement and we have to consider properly the evidence provide during the consultation we will publish response set out our final decision soon but we remain on track to introduce the levy via secondary legislation this summer it have be month since the consultation close with no response and about other consultation relate to the white paper be also await response be the minister try to kick change into the long grass and if not will he please confirm when the response will be publish reject that accusation there be proposal in the white paper half of which will be finalise as result of the consultation or be complete further three consultation have end and we be now analyse those the levy be priority because we want the fund to be direct where they be need most on the basis of evidence and we be work at pace to ensure that happen also point out that it be this government who introduce it artistic spaces if she will take step with relevant stakeholder to help provide space for artist to create and display their work high quality affordable workspace be essential to ensure that we can retain our fine creative talent the government be commit to encourage local authority and property owner to make space available for cultural activity arts council england be already support artist space through funding and broker partnership the national portfolio boast numerous workspace that receive revenue funding such as spike island and yorkshire artspace which offer space for artist to create work and gallery space for exhibit new work leighton buzzard dunstable and many other part of my constituency be bless with an abundance of artist painter sculptor and other but they have very few place where they can create their work they need more studio space and more workspace and even few place in which to exhibit provide such space should be essential it aid economic activity increase footfall and increase wellbee so how can we ensure that it be essential as the minister say and not an afterthought it really do matter thank my hon friend for raise his concern about the creative community in leighton buzzard it sound like buzz creative community as say we support creative industry primarily through arts council england which have initiative that look at workspace encourage organisation in his constituency and community to make application for grant because there be specific fund available art venue be vital to our local culture and our community but they be also hotbed for new talent to display or perform their late work which be critical to the uk creative sector pub be increasingly use for show artwork as much as they be for perform music think of pub such as the crown inn back in the day or the hope and anchor in islington that be why it be so important that we save pub such as the punch bowl in warwick which developer want to convert into house last year be the bad year for the closure of music venue what be the minister do to stop that rate of closure we share the hon gentleman concern about grassroots music venue which be why we have specific fund set aside to help save some of the most treasured community venue we also have the localism act which allow community to designate particular community asset of value give community time to raise fund to save those kind of asset it be something that we be talk about lot with music venue group and we be also look at give they help to buy the freehold of property so that those kind of asset can stay within community and remain talent pipeline as he suggest for many year to come english football financial sustainability what recent discussion she have have with the premier league

financial sustainability of football as whole have meet the premier league the english football league many stakeholder and parliamentarian to ensure that the legislation be appropriately draft have meet over club and senior executive from the league many time be grateful to the secretary of state for that answer we do not have to look too far across the east midland to see that club such as nottingham forest derby county coventry city and leicester city have find themselves in some form of difficulty so welcome the government plan to introduce regulator to bring some stability to the football pyramid however how do we ensure that we strike balance so that we do not strangle and over regulate the good league in the world the premiership as my hon friend mention the premier league be world lead it be worth billion and we absolutely want to ensure that it stay first and world class that be why the legislation take proportionate approach it take on board the fact that the regulator will have to work very closely with the league include the premier league we call it an advocacy first approach and have work very carefully with the team be very confident that the legislation take balanced and proportionate approach football be nothing without the fan and the secretary of state may recall that while ago mention to the sport minister the idea of postponement promise that be in response to spate of fixture that have be cancel at very short notice the minister say that he would raise it with the efl and understand that he do so be grateful for that but wonder whether the secretary of state agree that we need to keep the momentum go forward will she and the minister continue to work with the efl to come up with solution that work for fan the hon

sure he will know that in his own constituency st andrew church be already exemplify much of this good work under the excellent leadership of the reverend tom houston who train as youth worker prior

that that work be be take forward abortion legislation to ask the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners if the church will publish statement on its position on amendment table to the criminal justice bill relate to the decriminalisation of abortion before report stage of that bill the church of england believe that the foetus be human life with the potential to develop while recognise that there can be strictly limit condition under which abortion may be morally preferable to any available alternative the church also believe that every possible support especially by church member should be give to those who be pregnant and in difficult circumstance the church would support new clause and and believe that while woman should not face criminalisation anyone coerce woman to have an abortion or provide one beyond the legal limit or supply an abortion kit for late term use should be prosecute welcome the support for new clause and think the second church estates commissioner have give implicit opposition to the new clause in the name of the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson but be gobsmacke not to have have clear statement on the criminality of terminate pregnancy up to the moment of birth by whomsoever be the intention to drive we into the arm of rome be he as gobsmacke as be be grateful to my right hon friend for his interest in these serious issue which give their importance be sure the house will want to treat sensitively will convey his comment to the leadership of the church but just to repeat the church be support the two week reduction in the age of viability from to week base on the late available evidence that foetus do survive from week onwards it be also support protection for down syndrome child to make the case that abortion beyond the legal limit should not be acceptable for such child the church support the continue prosecution of medical practitioner who assist with abortion beyond the legal limit electoral commission committee the hon member for luton south represent the speaker committee on the electoral commission be ask disinformation in election to ask the

engine such as google with material generate by ai which be design to produce only thing that sound like information poison the well so to speak with marked impact on search result with this automation of fake news and fake oracle what plan do the electoral commission have to put out guidance on ai produce material the commission encourage all campaigner to undertake their role of

church commissioners the hon member for south west bedfordshire represent the church commissioners be ask armenian church jerusalem whether the church have take recent step to support the armenian church in the old city of jerusalem the bishop of southwark have raise this issue repeatedly in the other place over the past six month and it remain an ongoing and very concern issue only day ago an unlawful eviction be lead by the israeli police within the premise of the armenian patriarchate with no court order or permit present those of we who be good friend of israel need to call out the violent activity of the settler movement the armenian christians have enjoy the good part of year in their part of the old city in tranquillity the appalling incident on april be lead not just by thug but by an israeli officer call assaf harel frankly there be downright intimidation and an attempt to force out armenian christians the christian population in the old city have decline from century ago to just will the church of england stand up for christians in the old city be extremely grateful to my right hon friend for his sustained interest in this really important issue it would be an absolute tragedy if there be to be no christians leave in the holy land the house will have hear the figure that he have just present the pressure face the armenian church exemplify those face by other church in jerusalem and the west bank the armenian patriarch of jerusalem be one of the custodian of the holy land and overseer of the four quarter of the city the church of england be absolutely clear that the historic settlement and the status quo of jerusalem need to be maintain the lack of any call for restraint from the israeli government be escalate tension in jerusalem and that remain great concern sale of land whether the church provide guidance to parish on the sale of land where there be local opposition to that sale when the church commissioners sell land they seek to engage all those who be affect by sale or development the commissioner be not aware of any land that they own be for sale in north east bedfordshire be grateful to my hon friend for his response the word engage be interesting in this context it be the case that there be church in my constituency where there be local opposition to the sale of allotment land discussion be hold initially with the diocese and then at church house in westminster my hon friend will be aware that in such discussion there be an imbalance of power so can he assure that there be adequate guidance to enable parishioner and local community to combat effectively pressure to sell land where there be clearly local opposition particularly agree with my hon friend about the importance of allotment for which there be often very long waiting list the land at henlow be own by the diocese of st albans and will ask the diocesan secretary to contact he of course he can also speak to the bishop of bedford and the bishop of st albans whom we both know well charity law place fiduciary duty on organisation to gain good value from the sale of their asset that may be an issue that my hon friend would want to raise with the relevant government minister in the context of what be happen in his constituency church schools what recent assessment the commissioner have make of the contribution of church school to education in harrow east constituency and england the church of england educate more than million child in its school which include of all primary school in england church school in harrow east do incredible work and among they be st john school in stanmore which have many child for whom english be not their first language and who be from disadvantaged background that school achieve reading progress score of compare with the average score in the rest of the local authority of that excellent achievement be to be warmly commend be very proud of the fact that parent in harrow east have the option of church education or the religious ethos education of their choice however as we all know the birth rate be drop as be the number of child who need primary place in harrow there be therefore direct threat to the roll at st john and other religious base school which may become unviable what action be the church take to enable young people particularly those who have recently come to this country who may be of christian faith but not necessarily of the church of england faith to identify with church school and get that sort of education it may surprise my hon friend and the house that there be some church of england school in which all the child be from other faith that be because church school be community school and welcome all will draw his concern about fall roll number both to the diocese of london and to the national education department of the church of england however in my experience parent have pretty good nose for find their way to good school the result at st john about which have just tell the house should help in this case business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence april will include monday april consideration of lords message to the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill follow by debate on motion on hospice funding the subject for this debate be determine by the backbench business committee tuesday april second reading of the football governance bill follow by if necessary consideration of lords message to the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill wednesday

consumers bill wednesday may remain stage of the automated vehicles bill lords thursday may business to be determine by the backbench business committee the house will rise for the early may bank holiday at the conclusion of business on may and return on tuesday may may take this opportunity to put on record my deep sympathy to mr speaker on the loss of his dear father doug hoyle remember he as real character and an important figure in the labour movement over many decade serve both as an mp and then as peer he be proud northerner and represent the tradition of the labour movement know that he be incredibly proud of mr speaker and know how much mr speaker and cath care for he in his later year my thought be with they both the attack by iran on israel have rightly be condemn by all side of the house thankfully its intention be thwart and we join together in call for restraint and de escalation in the aftermath we can not let those recent event deter or distract from international effort to bring about sustainable ceasefire in gaza and create the condition for lasting two state solution as global conflict increase it be unacceptable that the government have reject recommendation from the cross party procedure committee for the foreign secretary to be accountable in this house it be simply not the case that he or the government have be forward lean in that regard as the leader of the house have say statement by his now deputy the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell have be few and far between and his appearance at select committees have all but dry up many time in these exchange the leader of the house have assure we that member would have the opportunity to question the foreign secretary say that when the procedure committee bring forward measure be sure those measure will be put in report november vol so why have she now block that or do she lose the argument in government she seem to struggle to be hear in government lately know that she be keen to talk about defence spending too although apparently no block she do she want to take the opportunity today know that she like will be concern to hear that the uk now spend less on defence as percentage of gdp than when labour be last in office the leader of the house be not listen to when it come to legislative business before the house either be really puzzled that she be unable to support flagship piece of government legislation as she apparently think it be unworkable forgive madam deputy speaker but be it not the job of the leader of the house to ensure that any government legislation table be well draft think through and will achieve its aim she chair the government legislation committee do she not she have more influence than nearly anybody else on the drafting of bill so what go wrong after our easter break we have return to groundhog day it might be new term but it be the same old story more decent conservative members announce that they be stand down treasury ministers hit the airwave and get the number wrong weak prime minister who can not face down his own party run scared from his own legislation and refuse to say how his cut to national insurance will be fund the former prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss still unable to show any contrition for her action directly cost mortgage holder hundred of pound month cabinet split and rival faction all on open display with ever more extreme position and platform take and yet more tory sleaze and scandal today revelation about the hon member for fylde mark menzies be extraordinary they raise very serious question about the misuse of fund and the pressure put on other to facilitate it perhaps more importantly they also raise question about how these issue be handle by the conservative party there be worrying pattern of cover up and inaction so can the leader of the house shed some light what do the chief whip the prime minister and the party chairman the right hon member for north west durham mr holden know and when why do it take the publication of the story today for the whip to be remove have this matter be refer to the police and if not why not it seem that yet again like with the hon member for hazel grove mr wragg and so many other recent case of sleaze and scandal the government be too weak to act decisively and instead choose to brush thing under the carpet the truth be that they have give up on governing and give up on win the next election it be all about save their own skin and the inevitable leadership battle can tell the leader of the house that we on the labour benches have be there before and it do not end well the public do not easily forgive politician who put party before country and do not focus relentlessly on fix the problem they face join the hon lady in formally convey my sympathy to mr speaker on the loss of his father have speak to he privately and write to he as well also congratulate dad walk on be award the petition of the year by the petitions committee for their important work on suicide prevention and wish all of they in total and everyone else run the marathon good luck on monday evening the very special jewish festival of passover begin like their ancestor before they jewish family around the world will gather around their seder table to retell the story of the jewish people exodus from egypt however this year many of they will be leave an empty seat open at those table for those still hold captive by hamas in gaza hope this will be the last jewish holiday where they be unable to celebrate with their family and wish chag sameach to all those celebrate also thank all hon member for their resolve and support with regard to israel security that be an important message that we send from this house the hon lady mention the issue of the foreign secretary and the government work in that regard be accountable to this house since the foreign secretary be appoint we have have eight foreign commonwealth and development office statement three prime ministerial statement on foreign affair general debate in government time on the situation in the red sea and westminster hall debate respond to by fcdo minister as well as oral question in both houses we be stick with the usual precedent of both houses the hon lady ask to comment on defence and be very happy to compare this government record with the last labour government record we have have the large uplift to the defence budget since the end of the cold war when we come into office we inherit defence budget and equipment programme with billion black hole on royal united services institute figure remember from my own constituency that portsmouth faslane and plymouth be have to state the case to continue to be naval basis in this country the previous labour government know their record with member of the armed force be poor because in they disenfranchise all of they by change the rule on voter registration the hon lady point to the vote on smoking think free vote in this place on such matter be good however whatever our difference of opinion in future year be hopeful there will be few fag packet around on which labour economic team can do their sum and think that be jolly good thing labour members seem to be continue to push their line on national insurance contribution good look to they in that respect but let just point out some of the reason why it will not get traction national insurance contribution receipt do not determine the nhs budget or pension it be only the labour party that have cut the nhs budget and it be actually labour policy at least it be when come into the chamber to support our tax cut hope that be helpful information for the hon lady the hon lady mention some very serious allegation and other incident that come to light during the recess these be very serious matter and some of they be under police investigation so she would not expect to comment on they but we take these matter very seriously we have take action again this week to improve online safety and other matter the deepfake phenomenon be more widespread than we might think and the public may well be fool into think that something be the case when it be not or that person they know be manifestly different and we need to expose such scam the hon lady talk about defence and someone might be tempt to believe person be commit to this nation nuclear deterrent but note that in reality the same person be content to serve in the cabinet of the last labour leader and that six of his front benchers vote to end our nuclear deterrent they might think that the labour party be the party of the nhs but as we know it be the only party that have cut the nhs budget they might be tempt by the sound of securonomic only to discover that that be build on unfunded pledge and unspecified tax increase someone might be tempt by the look of the shadow chancellor commitment to end unpaid internship only to find that she have use they herself or of labour campaign against fire and rehire only to discover that that be exactly what labour hq do under the current labour leader they might be suck in by talk about its wanting to protect pensioner and then learn that it will not commit to our triple lock and that hundred of thousand more pensioner be live in absolute poverty under the last labour government business might be flatter by email and online ad from labour unaware of the new regulatory burden that would be pile on to they under labour government my advice be do be tempt people should not be fool by shadow foreign secretary who nominate the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn to be prime minister shadow international development secretary who want to turn our armed force into hippy hit squad party that until last year have shadow minister for disarmament shadow energy secretary whose poor judgment on national security and our interest lead to disaster and to op shader shadow deputy prime minister who hold other to standard she do not think should apply to herself or party that talk tough on border but as of yesterday have vote time again strengthen they the leader of the opposition have spend four year in office post picture to his profile of neil kinnock tony blair and margaret thatcher do not be fool behind that profile sit man with no plan for this country except the vested interest of militant union and support for the argument of those who would do this nation harm it be deepfake labour lead by catfish keir do not fall for it rise order before we proceed may on behalf of mr speaker thank the leader of the house and the shadow leader of the house and all other member who have express their sympathy to he on the loss of his father lord hoyle doug hoyle be dedicated parliamentarian an inspirational kind and amusing gentleman and very proud father he will be very greatly miss and be sure the whole house will join in send our sympathy to mr speaker and his family our thought will be with they as they make arrangement for lord hoyle funeral call the

by those in the other place and the lords minister say that he would respond to number of point in writing if information be give by the minister that be not give to this house could it be put in write statement or put in the library many of the point especially those make by baroness hayter be important we need an inquiry into how thing get into the state that have to be expose by the four year review by dr hilary cass for which we all thank she one thing that have not yet happen but may happen in the next week or two be the publication of the report from the select committee on the holocaust memorial bill through its hybrid procedure it be come later than we anticipate and may contain some interesting recommendation or decision will the government say as soon as possible whether they intend to go on try to ram this proposal through they have already spend more than million achieve nothing in the last eight and half year so will they have roundtable and consider spend million get memorial up in the next two year during the lifetime of some of the holocaust survivor and move the learn centre to the imperial war museum thank my hon friend for that question and will certainly ensure that his request about the cass review be undertake he know that process be be go through at the moment for the memorial and will again ensure that the relevant secretary of state have hear

passover and about mr speaker late father and send my sincere condolence to he and his family since we last meet for business question the leader of the house have be keep busy and think that one of her social medium post on during the recess be particularly eye catch indeed it be unique because it ask her constituent to contact she directly so outraged be she by burn injustice it start damn

anger which be not just from the leader of the house but from member across the chamber be it child get sick swimming through human faece in the river of england or perhaps the endless strike in the nhs in england be it arm sale to israel or an economic crisis that be trigger by former prime minister now saviour of the west be it the cruel immoral illegal and ruinously expensive rwanda scheme perhaps the angry post be just response to the leader of the house constituent in portsmouth who be now furious rightly enough about the likely demolition of the brand new border control post in portsmouth which be among herd of such white elephant around the uk and direct result of the right hon lady ongoing brexit confusion that will cost fortune no that be not what prompt the outburst the leader of the house and many of her colleague be furious about england new football right they be so no the farce of the doom border post on the right hon lady doorstep have not figure in the busy social medium output we see from she her government disastrous brexit import charge be none the less come in on april cause even more costly confusion and raise very real concern about food shortage as well as her own local difficulty may ask the leader of the house for an urgent debate on these new brexit charge and the ongoing catastrophe of brexit which scot reject yet be force to suffer the ill effect of her constituent will be interested to hear an answer ideally before she waste more time launch into another anti scotland video script first should thank the hon lady for her concern

exporter in the world we be do very well be always keen to facilitate my constituent who wish to make complaint to all sort of organisation in their ability to do that just say to the hon lady that our nation flag be important to the people of portsmouth suggest that she might like to think twice before she mock that view these thing and these tradition be important they be not the worship of ash but the preservation of fire the hon lady have be busy too during the recess pen article about how much my colleague and hate scotland and the scottish people she have do it again in her opening remark and her question to at some point she will have to say why she think that be the case know that the scottish rugby team have be do well against england but that be not ground to justify her accusation against the snp seem hellbent on expose hate where there be none understand that of the hate crime report under the snp new law with make on april alone only nine will qualify under this new law and seven of those nine have now be dismiss police scotland deserve our thank and our sympathy be sure that those police officer join the force to do something much more helpful for their community it be only the conservatives who have stand against this lunacy and we will continue to do that other party have the opportunity to repeal this law and choose not to we on the government

the environment agency much to the annoyance of resident across calderdale this pause do not apply to permit apply for from local authority rather than from the environment agency do she agree that unless all permit be pause and all application be consider as part of this piece of work it look as if it be one rule for government ministers and another rule for everybody else from what know of the

and we should praise his local police force for its part in it the conservatives have cut police officer decimate our local neighbourhood team there be now few police officer and police community support officer in our neighbourhood team than in and the percentage of people report never see police officer on their street have double since can we have debate about the number of police officer and the conservatives claim about what they be do about it so that they can explain why they cut police officer in the first place we can also then talk about labour pledge to put neighbourhood team in every community think the hon gentleman have his fact wrong we have record number of police officer on roughly the same resource when we leave aside online fraud we have halve crime the outlier across the country be in labour control area they be in london under the current labour london mayor where knife crime and serious and violent crime have soar they be also in area such as the west midland where there be labour police and crime commissioner the stat speak for themselves person be more likely to be victim of crime if they be in an area that have labour police and crime commissioner our police have do tremendous job since we have halve crime on roughly the same resource that be what people get with the conservatives hajj begin in mid june when thousand of british muslims will travel to saudi arabia for their pilgrimage to mecca last week meet city of london commander khan who highlight to the grow issue around hajj fraud thousand of brits be be target by rogue

consultation that look at whether we need to reform the act be also an important piece of work for whitehall it have record number of response more than and although do not read they all read the one from healthcare professional they raise concern that the rule about refer people into such service be too restrictive and look only at one particular type of condition as oppose to the raft of condition that they be deal with hope that work inform whitehall it certainly lead to other review include the cass review think that be important these issue need to be grip but while we do so we need to send clear message to people who be tran that their right and their ability to lead good quality of life be also protect that be the aim of the current minister for equalities refer the house

on behalf of the gibraltar government several year ago again that be not strictly matter of order for the chair but it be now matter of record and thank the right hon gentleman also thank the leader

select committee statement on behalf of the procedure committee dame karen bradley will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of the statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not speech also emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not to the relevant minister front benchers therefore may take part in questioning start by add my own condolence to the many that have be express today to mr speaker and his family thank the backbench business committee for find time for this statement and pass my regard to the chair of that committee the hon member for gateshead ian mearns with permission would like to make statement on the government response to the procedure committee report on commons scrutiny of secretaries of state in the house of lords which be publish yesterday follow the appointment of the noble lord cameron as foreign secretary in november last year mr speaker write to the procedure committee ask we to examine how secretaries of state who sit in the house of lords could be scrutinise by this house the committee publish its report on january this year and follow its publication make similar statement to this house to explain our conclusion and recommendation in that statement urge the government to act quickly on the matter give the strength of feeling across this house the government send their response only after the house have rise for the easter recess it be for that reason that the committee be unable to publish it until yesterday afternoon once the committee have meet despite that hope all right hon and hon member have now have the chance to read the government response in full it be with regret that make this statement to inform the house that the government have reject our recommendation the reason put forward by the government for reject the recommendation that lords secretaries of state should be scrutinise by this house at the bar of the house be that it be untested as method for routine scrutiny and that our recommendation would have significant constitutional implication be sorry to say that find those argument unconvincing our report be clear that while our recommendation may be novel in the modern era they be not wholly untested moreover our recommendation be limit to this parliament to deal with issue that this house face now without set precedent for the future we be very clear on that suggest that the government have not make the case that our recommendation could have unforeseen constitutional implication and have fail to adequately set out what they think such implication could be the committee be still of the view that the government should agree to our recommendation to use the bar of the house to allow question to be put directly to the foreign secretary by all member of this house in reject our recommendation the government suggest that there be sufficient mechanism in place scrutiny in the house of lords and in select committees of both houses as well as response by other foreign commonwealth and development office ministers to member of this house at departmental question statement and urgent question to discharge the foreign secretary accountability to this house our report deal with those point in detail we be clear that we have great respect for the work that the house of lords do in its scrutiny of the government moreover the foreign affairs and international development committees do excellent work hold the fcdo to account as do other committees in both houses however their work complement and add to the scrutiny that be undertake in this chamber it be not and can not be substitute for that scrutiny as we note in our report select committees and this chamber have unique mandate function and purpose they be not synonymous the government say nothing in their response to make we think again about this matter all member of this house must have the ability to scrutinise fcdo policy by question the foreign secretary in this place the alternative proceeding through which the foreign secretary have be and will be subject to scrutiny have the potential to exclude some member of this house from be able to conduct effective scrutiny on behalf of their constituent suggest that this be an unacceptable state of affair and respectfully submit that the government response miss this key point entirely scrutiny by elect mp on behalf of their constituent be fundamental part of our modern democratic system and while welcome the appointment of my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell to the position of deputy foreign secretary early this week the point still stand that the current arrangement do not allow all member of this place to put their question directly to the individual with ultimate responsibility for the work of the fcdo lastly the government argue that our proposal risk undermine the constitutional balance between the two houses my committee respectfully disagree our report be clear that our recommendation be to enable scrutiny of secretaries of state in the house of lords at the bar of the house of commons not to require it or to summon such individual we recognise and continue to respect the right of the other place to govern its own affair however by reject our recommendation on scrutiny at the bar of the house on this basis the government be put the cart before the horse they be use concern about comity to pre emptively exclude the possibility of even have discussion with the other place about how to facilitate the arrangement we have recommend the government refusal to engage with our recommendation in meaningful way mean that we will never know whether the other place would be willing to engage with we in facilitate such opportunity for scrutiny of secretaries of state in the house of lords this be regrettable situation for we to find ourselves in the government response to our report be most disappointing it ignore the genuine concern of many member of this house that the holder of one of the high office in the land the foreign secretary be unable to be scrutinise by all the member of this house it do so at time of increase international uncertainty when the life of many of our constituent be directly affect by crisis abroad for which the foreign secretary hold ultimate ministerial responsibility the government response misread the mood of the house on this matter and undermine the principle of accountability of ministers to this democratically elect house urge the government to think again on our recommendation and to revisit this matter urgently thank the right hon lady we will now take question to the chair of the select committee and call the shadow leader of the house thank the chair and all member of her committee for their diligent work which be carry out in good faith in the expectation that their recommendation would be take forward do she agree with that there be wide support across this house cross party support for her recommendation and that the government have misread the mood of the house what plan do she have for the house to express its view on her committee report and perhaps to take forward its recommendation despite the government response to they thank the shadow leader of the house for her question she be correct that we as committee take evidence from all member of this house we listen to representation and we conduct an all member survey it be very clear from those response that there be desire to ensure there be opportunity for proper scrutiny by member of this house of the foreign secretary we be not as committee propose to do any further work on this matter as say in my statement urge the government to rethink their response and perhaps come forward with some other suggestion call as member of the committee patrick grady thank the chair for her statement be it not predictable that this be go to be the government response as say in the adjournment debate have on this topic just before easter if the government have want to make arrangement for the foreign secretary to appear at the bar of the house or be otherwise scrutinise by the house as whole they could have bring forward such provision without any reference to the procedure committee that also apply to the point make early about opposition day the government can at any time bring forward recommendation and change to standing orders would it not make more sense if the government present we as committee with their recommendation which we could scrutinise rather than ask we to come up with recommendation that they then reject out of hand thank the hon gentleman who be fellow member of the committee for his question think he be reflect the sense of frustration that be feel in the committee when we meet yesterday afternoon it be in the government gift to change any matter they wish to change they control the order paper and can make such decision as committee we stand ready to scrutinise and to be consult on propose change however it be often helpful if the government give we some indication of the change they may want so that we can at least spend our time productively in give advice on those recommendation rather than see our recommendation reject out of hand call as member of the committee kevan jones thank the right hon lady for her statement and for her work as chair of the committee she mention the announcement this week that the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell have be appoint deputy foreign secretary and she will also know that the foreign secretary have specific responsibility for oversight of he or she appear before the intelligence and security committee which sit on and obviously the nature of some of those issue can not be discuss publicly do the right hon lady have any information on whether the remit of the right hon member for sutton coldfield have be change so that he can reply to non secure question that member might have for example on the operation of the right hon gentleman make very good point the appointment of deputy foreign secretary be what happen in the past there be precedent for that for example when lord carrington be foreign secretary and in previous time it be something that we have be keen to see because it mean that the house have more opportunity to scrutinise senior member of the foreign commonwealth and development office team be afraid do not have sight of the change that may have be make to the portfolio of my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield and perhaps that be something that the leader of the house who be in her place and listen intently could inform the committee about at some point in principle no one should be in government who can not be scrutinise in the elect chamber represent the people of this country that be the principle that all government should apply and do not think that this appointment should have take place until that issue be sort out be there view from the foreign secretary himself lord cameron on whether he should be here answer question in this chamber the hon gentleman tempt but that be definitely above my pay grade the chair of the committee have in the view of the liberal democrats do great work on try to bring the noble lord cameron to the bar of the house she be right to say that the last time one of the four great office of state be occupy by member of the other place be lord carrington resign from the role of foreign secretary after argentina invade the falkland islands he do so partly because back benchers in the house of commons have be warn about that possibility and there be feeling that the foreign office have not heed their warning under lord carrington give that the uk relation with some of it adversary be as tense as they have be since the early do the right hon lady think that the noble lord cameron might want to avert such an outcome by answer question at the bar of the house the committee consider all the point carefully and look at the evidence and at precedent that be why we come to the conclusion that the bar of the house be the right place for scrutiny of secretaries of state in the house of lords we be keen to ensure that proper scrutiny could be do by this place because we as elect representative will often reflect what our constituent be tell we and what we be see on the ground in way that no other body in this place can do member of the other place do extremely good work in scrutinise the government but without constituent they be perhaps not able to reflect what we hear from people on the ground likewise member of select committees do not generally ask constituency base question in their work they tend to ask question on theme or on the overall topic of the day we have that unique role in this place and that be why we be keen to ensure that there could be some form of scrutiny we be disappointed that the government have reject that thank my right hon friend for the work she do on the committee and for be so mild mannered in report to the house today the feeling of the procedure committee do she accept that there be strong anger on the committee not so much about the response from the government we expect that they might reject our recommendation but about the nature of that rejection and the failure to answer any of the point or put forward any detailed justification for reject our recommendation do she agree that it almost make we member of the committee feel that we be hold in contempt by the leader of the house feel that my hon friend have make his point effectively and thank the clerks of the committee for help perhaps to tone down the response base on the committee meeting we have have there be also real concern that we do not receive the response before the house rise for the easter recess during which we be all focused on our constituency and not necessarily in westminster the need to bring committee member together and for the committee to be quorate mean that we be unable to report the response until yesterday that be another matter of great concern to the committee thank the chair of the committee and the committee for their excellent work on this piece be back bench member of parliament represent diverse constituency with many diaspora community from country that rarely get much of hearing in this place such as sudan bosnia and kurdistan do the right hon lady share my concern that whereas the secretary of state be an experienced statesperson with knowledge of the different area across the foreign office have more junior ministers represent the department here mean that they do not have that expertise across the piece it be right that all member of this place be able to question he accordingly think that all ministers in the foreign commonwealth and development office be exemplary and carry out their role with distinction the hon lady be correct to say that the secretary of state have unique role in any department and they have the overarching view that be why select committees call in the secretary of state at least three time year for an overarching evidence session on all the work of department be great fan of the noble lord cameron and delight that he be in his role think he represent the united kingdom superbly and would love the opportunity to see he at the bar of the house it would be incredible to see he because he would answer question thoroughly and rigorously and we as member of parliament would take much from those session back to our constituent on point of order mr deputy speaker the seriousness of what we have just hear from the chair of the procedure committee can not be understate the world be more divided and dangerous than at any moment can remember in my year in parliament we have war in ukraine war in the middle east and an increasingly assertive china last night the government effectively reject the procedure committee recommendation for the foreign secretary to take question from this house and it be untenable that in this time of disorder the foreign secretary great office of state for reason refuse to be accountable to this house my party think that have foreign secretary in the lords be absurd year ago in the day of lord curzon and the appointment of the first ever deputy foreign secretary this week be an unconstitutional sop we have not need it in year of this parliament and he be not the man who meet the foreign secretaries of israel of our arab partner or of the united states he simply do not have the accountability of the foreign secretary give what we have hear and give the strength of feeling across this house what now to get the foreign secretary to take question from member of parliament at this most dangerous of geopolitical moment be grateful to the right hon gentleman for the point of order and for give notice of it but he have hear the statement and the exchange on the select committee report include the response by the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley and be afraid that there be nothing can add to they from the chair thank the right hon lady for her statement and for answer seven question backbench business access to redress schemes relevant document correspondence from the chair of the committee of public accounts to the comptroller and auditor general on government compensation and financial redress scheme report to the house on january beg to move that this house recognise the challenge face by individual and business in access effective dispute resolution and obtain redress in case of injustice believe that the government need to address these specific challenge namely fragmented and inconsistent redress landscape consider statutory guidance to be an essential measure to ensure compensation and redress scheme follow common principle and lead to fair and independent outcome and call on the government to create statutory guidance with common principle for set up and operate redress scheme it be my honour to move the motion that stand in my name and that of the hon member for hazel grove mr wragg thank the backbench business committee for grant this debate also thank the chair of the public accounts committee the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier for her recent correspondence with the comptroller and auditor general call on public body to have redress scheme that be effective timely proportionate and fair samuel beckett famously write try again fail again fail well what if we learn nothing from our previous failure what if we simply fail fail again and approach the failure as in the past only to fail bit differently and with many of the same mistake as before that be the situation we face with compensation and redress follow scandal imagine that every member of this house will have receive correspondence from constituent who have be fail and treat unfairly in the wake of scandal rather than be able to access swift and fair redress they have instead be subject to further hardship delay and unfair treatment sometimes that mistreatment can be as devastating as the pain cause initially by the scandal there have rightly be significant attention nationally in recent month on the post office horizon scandal and in particular on the various scheme set up to provide redress to the victim of what be the most widespread miscarriage of justice in british legal history sub postmaster of post office in my constituency be one of the hundred wrongful convict janine powell be wrongfully accuse of steal from her post office branch in tiverton she be subsequently sack and arrest before be convict at trial in exeter in she describe feel confused dismayed numb that be because ms powell be sentence to month in prison serve five month she be send to prison just two day after her daughter birthday she say that the hard part of her wrongful imprisonment be leave her child she say ve miss out on do thing with they can get that back no amount of money could ever make up for what happen to ms powell but compensation can at least try to make up for some of the loss they face sadly the various post office compensation scheme that have exist have fail to provide swift and fair redress as know from another constituent case that be deal with accord to the law firm howe and co which represent sub postmaster the compensation scheme continue to be exceptionally slow and refuse to entertain application from person who be plainly entitle to apply this afternoon hope to outline that the post office case be but one example of wide problem no guidance exist on when and how compensation scheme should be establish or what an oversee body should look like that mean that each scheme have its own unique and dysfunctional set of rule reinvent the wheel each time scandal emerge mean that victim be fail by the very system that be mean to right the wrong of the past the hon and gallant member be make an important point about how we seem to have unique circumstance in try to overcome some of these issue for example the sodium valproate issue be raise through baroness cumberlege first do no harm report as with the infected blood scandal and the horizon scandal it have be outline time after time that redress should be forthcoming however the government again seem to be drag their foot why do he think that would be the hon member be exactly right to draw thread between several of these scandal that be partly because when new scandal emerge the organisation responsible be often the organisation charge with redress andrew bailey while chief executive of the financial conduct authority say in that it just do not seem to be sensible that every time one of these thing happen we have to set up something new beyond the post office scheme we have hear criticism both here and in the press on the infected blood inquiry as the hon member mention and windrush that criticism have point to intolerable delay or the problematic feature that often let the offend firm or institution off the hook be interested to develop my hon friend think about the financial conduct authority if be able will speak at great length about it later in the debate it administer the financial services compensation scheme which be fund set up by levy on financial service company themselves it be the maladministration of the fca or lack of proper regulation that often lead to these claim be bring essentially the people pay for the scheme have to do so because of the incompetence of the fca my right hon friend be exactly right the fca be not directly accountable to parliament but be accountable to parliament through the treasury too have have constituent find themselves in david and goliath scenario try to tackle issue of unfairness with the fca likewise in finance we have see the mis selling of interest rate hedging product and widespread financial misconduct against small and medium sized enterprise by the royal bank of scotland for example last year the all party parliamentary group on fair business banking conduct the first systematic review of compensation scheme in the uk and find flaw common to several of they scheme be frequently blight by unnecessary complexity delay and huge emotional and legal burden on victim often scheme be shroud in secrecy and lack proper independence be listen to the hon gentleman speech carefully and he be make some excellent point will he join in deplore the method by which organisation avoid their responsibility to many of our constituent for example the business of my constituent george dosoo ld partnership take on loan from rbs now natwest in he discover that sum of be remove without authority from the partnership account despite george obtain recent legal opinion indicate that his case have merit natwest maintain that the case be time bar and will not reopen it do the hon gentleman agree that time barring be another device that be far too often use by business and institution to deliberately undermine our constituent ability to obtain recourse the hon member be right about time barring have similar case with constituent of mine which might chime with hers nigel cairns be trap in what he describe as complete nightmare scenario with no way of escape after egregious misconduct by bank in nigel take out loan of from hsbc he have his house demolish in readiness to rebuild in preparation for the work the bank declare the termination and return of the loan that be in when the financial crisis be very much with we the bank subsequently agree to reinstate the loan but alter some of the term and condition so that the interest rate become double what nigel have originally agree to after year of repayment the bank declare that unless he could sell the property or repay the loan it would have to foreclose on he the financial ombudsman service refuse to look into the matter initially and subsequently mr cairns receive only for the stress and anxiety of the case the appg review look across compensation scheme find that over the past year the number of people affect amount to little over people when we consider some of the harrowing case we be describe today that number be thankfully quite small but it say to we that it be small enough number that these people could have timely redress and compensation if only we have body that could sort it out that bring on to another example infect blood during business question this morning the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson as she always do on thursday drive home on behalf of her constituent the need to compensate promptly those people affect by the infected blood scandal in the last hour we have hear of propose government amendment to the victims and prisoners bill to try to bring about compensation completely agree with the right hon member that by not set deadline for that compensation we allow this issue to run and run in the other place the liberal democrat peer baroness brinton seek to take that up with the government and propose an amendment that be much more vigorous in set timeframe for compensation but the government choose not to adopt it have constituent whose friend who have be affect by the infected blood scandal some of the tale that she have pass on be really harrowing her friend say in my be plan my funeral and feel like be contaminate and filthy meet and marry someone prepare to date woman with poison blood she speak of how it cause host of long term devastating side effect she continue lose my career as an it consultant it make infertile so have be unable to have family and we have we have to stop ivf and surrogacy attempt because become too ill to be parent ve have brain body psychological and emotional impact from this virus and then decade of exhausted fighting for an evasive and oft deny justice which cause its own damage include most recently the end of my marriage such people deserve to be compensate promptly they do not need the stress and worry of scheme that always seem to roll out into the future and of have to fight at every turn mass redress scheme be set up on an ad hoc basis they be voluntary and establish to tackle specific scandal follow failure of give organisation internal complaint procedure how do we ensure that the victim of our large and most damaging scandal and any unfortunate future victim be protect from unfair treatment and appropriately compensate we need the framework for redress to be improve to ensure that we do not make the same mistake again this debate be call to action for ministers the government must establish clear framework base on good practice the hbos read compensation scheme be another example in after year six individual be sentence to cumulative year in prison for their role in fraud that leave its victim in the word of the sentencing judge cheat defeated and penniless eight year on we have have more than two year of the discredit griggs review and further two year review the review and come up with new recommendation we be now in the fourth year of the foskett panel we would think that by now that we would have get it right but all the perpetrator of the crime be out of prison the victim have yet to be compensate and serious question remain about the panel there be set of underlie principle that would establish common sense bedrock for any compensation scheme and how it should be build on the composition of the foskett panel and the huge delay in the compensation due to those defraud in the hbos scandal there have be allegation that lloyds bank have big part in decide who be appoint to the panel would that not explain the delay and why people be not be pay the compensation that they believe they deserve the hon member be right that in redress scheme the perpetrator of the injustice be often charge with try to put it right of course the perpetrator have vested interest indeed it be not even vested it be just an interest in try to pay out as little as possible and in accept as little culpability as it can do the hon member agree that many victim be annoy by the way that these scheme become feeding frenzy for lawyer who in many case be the only people who ultimately benefit what really stick in the throat of many victim be that many lawyer may be get more out of the scheme than the individual affect be grateful to the right hon member for his intervention probably nobody in this place know more about the horizon compensation scheme than he do lee castleton one of the sub postmaster affect by the scandal say that during the past year million have be pay to some of the victim but we ve have million plus pay to lawyer we need set of underlie principle we need collaborative approach and process timeliness independence recognition of adversity transparency broad eligibility great accessibility and legal cost clear appeal mechanism and finally fairness and efficiency the hon and gallant member be kind in give way move back to the sodium valproate scandal we keep say that justice delay be justice deny but in that case it be not only child but grandchild who be impact because it look as though the effect of sodium valproate disorder be be pass on to grandchild as well scheme need to be not only fair but pragmatic so that once compensation be deliver they can still be open to claim say that thinking of the further after effect of one of the big scandal in the health service since thalidomide the hon member be exactly right about how young generation can be affect we have recently see attempt by some horizon victim and indeed child of victim to seek compensation the tragedy of his point about justice delay being justice deny be that old victim of these scandal be die before they see that justice and before enjoy any of the compensation that they deserve set out nine underlying principle that would establish common sense bedrock for compensation scheme to deliver those principle for fair redress and to guarantee independent oversight we need an arm length body to design and adjudicate the scheme the exist voluntary mechanism for redress be far too fragmented we need standing independent body that can provide consistency for victim of scandal no matter the sector which can be activate whenever new scandal emerge it should be constitute of expert so that it guarantee independence of judgment and should be accountable directly to parliament for the expenditure of any public fund and for its overall conduct critically victim must also have representation on the panel the structure would come at no extra cost to the taxpayer as the current compensation framework often prove lengthy and costly for both victim and taxpayer take together the nine uk redress scheme whether active or complete study by the all party parliamentary group on fair business banking have cost at least billion that figure cover not only the amount of compensation that have go to victim but as we have discuss the fee to solicitor accountant and firm that have engage to undertake review and indeed firm that be review review more often than not victim be leave feel cheat they eventually cling on to some sort of late inadequate consolation of redress and compensation in the case of the post office many of the sub postmaster who be expose to the scandal have still receive little compensation because most of the money be swallow up we need lesson to be learn from the array of scandal that have set out be curious to hear what the minister have to say about the proposal for an arm length body to deal with situation of the kind that and right hon and hon member have describe it be pleasure to follow the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord and be grateful to he for introduce this important subject be sorry that it have not attract more attention from hon member on both side of the house how often have we say there be nothing new under sun will start my remark by refer to august tanya price have whooping cough vaccine at the age of six month shortly after she develop convulsion and month later she be describe as motionless and expressionless be in debate in this house by her mp the late robert adley who be my predecessor but one as mp for christchurch although at that time the constituency be christchurch and lymington robert adley work tirelessly for month to try to obtain redress from the health service for tanya injury which be cause by the whooping cough vaccine that be year ago under labour government but little have change in the government institutional reluctance to admit to medical failure and institute redress scheme robert adley describe fight tanya battle as fight the nhs which he describe as be like spar with giant octopus that be all those year ago but do not see that the situation have change in his adjournment debate in the house of commons on march robert adley say this fight have be go on for long time certainly in the last four year group of parent have seek to get what they see as justice for their child but they have have precious little satisfaction the battle be in many way repetition of the thalidomide debate the result be decay confidence in all the immunisation programme it represent flirtation with tragedy particularly when most of the other vaccine appear to be safe harmless and have little or no disadvantageous side effect he rightly severely criticise the position adopt by the secretary of state in his refusal to consider compensation and until recently his refusal at least to discuss the problem report march vol it would be wonderful to say that thing have move on one of the consequence of the thalidomide scandal be the setting up of the royal commission head by lord pearson which take some five year to report eventually do so in it be set up follow the robens committee on safety and health at work and in the light of concern about thalidomide when the pearson report be publish it be welcome by the then prime minister as comprehensive review it be design to remove unnecessary litigation time delay and all the rest when get redress for people who have suffer medical injury induce by vaccine or other drug paragraph it be long report recommend the following we conclude that there be special case for pay compensation for vaccine damage where vaccination be recommend by public authority and be undertake to protect the community we have reach this conclusion when we be ask by the government for our view the pearson committee also recommend strict liability for vaccine damage sadly those recommendation be not implement although we do get the vaccine damage payment legislation of have be campaign to get that legislation bring up to date so that it be relevant to the circumstance of all those who have suffer loss and damage as result of do the right thing and take their vaccine it have be an uphill struggle the most recent information have be that there be so many application under the vaccine damage payment scheme that the government can not cope in three year only out of more than claim have be successful those be the figure as at january of those claim be still await resolution have be outstanding for more than six month and some for more than month that be directly damaging to all those people who be think of engage in civil claim which the government keep advise victim to do make civil claim against large multinational pharmaceutical company or the government for that matter be an expensive business have constituent whose father have the compensation but for whom that be wholly inadequate because of the severity and longevity of the injury and disability that he sustain as result of the vaccine he be find it nigh on impossible to get access to justice because solicitor will not take up his call even start an action will cost ten of thousand of pound that be an intolerable situation and one which all those year ago lord pearson be try to avoid the government feeble response be if you think you ve be injure by vaccine go and seek compensation through the court it do not work quite like that as sadly have be see by all those people whose case it have already be establish be cause by vaccine one would think that if the vaccine damage payment scheme have establish that an individual damage be cause by the vaccine as night follow day the government would concede liability in civil action far from it they insist that individual must fight the case before the court it be about power be it not as the hon gentleman rightly say the individual do not have the financial mean or expertise to take forward those case against either corporation or government in the post office scandal the post office spend million of our public money defend case that they know they would not win because they be try to stop the truth come out and to bankrupt and stop the individual from conclude the case that be right these be deep seat institutional failure this be not party political issue but one that affect everyone in this country this house be unable to persuade government and the official serve they to get real about what many people be suffer as result of the delay it seem as though the government policy perhaps lead by the treasury be always to postpone the inevitable the hon member for tiverton and honiton refer to the contaminated blood scandal find it unacceptable that those people whose case have be establish as deserve proper compensation be still wait there be similar case in the post office scandal as the right hon member for north durham mr jones say and in the sodium valproate case which have give rise to huge report which hope briefly to come to later go back to the issue with which be primarily concerned because chair the all party parliamentary group on vaccine damage there be now get on for claim under the scheme almost half be yet to be deal with so people be wait for their claim to be resolve under the system that operate if their claim be reject by the independent panel they have the right to have their case review that process itself generate further delay sometimes in excess of year meanwhile there be three year limitation on be able to bring civil action from the time the cause of the civil action arise raise this issue with the prime minister in private meeting and at prime minister question few week ago be pleased to say that follow that have meeting set up with the secretary of state for health and social care next week but will not hold my breath because just do not see any willingness on the part of officialdom even if there be willingness on the part of ministers to address these outrageous injustice it go to the heart of trust in public service and in government if people can not trust the government to do the right thing if they take the vaccine and it turn out to have be very bad for their health the deal should be it always use to be that the government look after they and see they right but that be not what be happen instead those people be be put through the ringer and enormous amount of bureaucracy and time be be waste and to very little effect except that the treasury can probably say well we can actually guarantee that we will have to spend this amount of money now year ago when be shadow treasury minister look at the issue arise from the equitable life scandal that be failure by the treasury own team of regulator to protect investor in pension scheme under equitable life at one stage they be think to be as good as invest in the consolidated fund you may remember mr deputy speaker that everybody be join in have equitable life pension well the regulator be asleep on the job the ombudsman find that that be the situation and order compensation the government refuse compensation and say that they would make ex gratia payment as be the case today we know that much of the money that be eventually set aside have not yet be deliver to the victim of the equitable life scandal and that the treasury be refuse to distribute the money say well that be basically win for the treasury be it surprising that confidence in our institution and in government with small rapidly diminish today debate be of fundamental importance hope that the cabinet minister when he respond will come up with some specific proposal on what will be do in relation to all the individual case that will be refer to in this debate as well as deal with the deep seat institutional problem to which have refer the minister without portfolio my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey with whom have previously raise this matter in cabinet office question and who at one stage think would respond to this debate be charge with ensure that we address the issue of the time bar on vaccine damage claim would be very grateful to my hon friend the minister if when he respond to the debate he can give we some positive news on that point even if not on many other the covid vaccine damage payment scheme be not strict liability scheme and it be not even compensation scheme but it be well than nothing why be it however that the maximum payment under the scheme have not be update since it would now be about if update why be we update everything else in line with inflation but not the vaccine damage payment scheme for people for whom take vaccine be disastrous again we can not get any answer out of the treasury or the government sometimes there be expression of sympathy but they be not much use what we want be action what justification can there be for erode the value of vaccine damage payment to the extent that have refer to the cumberlege report independent medicines and medical devices safety review be set up in in response to concern about the primodos hormone pregnancy test the use of sodium valproate in pregnancy and vaginal mesh the review which be lead by baroness cumberlege publish its report in july it make number of serious and compelling recommendation include the establishment of an independent redress agency if the hon member for tiverton and honiton who introduce the debate think that the government be go to respond positively to the suggestion he put forward just ask he to look at the record that be an ex conservative health minister make clear recommendation on page to set up an independent redress agency new independent redress agency for those harm by medicine and medical device should be create base on model operate effectively in other country the redress agency will administer decision use non adversarial process with determination base on avoidable harm look at systemic failing rather than blame individual how long do it take for the government to respond to that report they publish their response not in but in july exactly one year later which fit the pattern we be discuss it take they year to respond to the report and they cursorily reject its recommendation for new redress agency state we do not accept this recommendation we do not believe that redress agency would make product safe and support our commitment to patient safety we also believe it be already possible for government and other to provide redress where this be consider necessary the government therefore have no plan to establish an independent redress agency it take the government year to prepare that wording and explanation all one can do really be despair there be an opportunity today for the minister to say well that be all under previous government now we have new government and they will accept all the recommendation of the cumberlege report the cumberlege report also recommend that discretionary scheme should be establish for sodium valproate hormone pregnancy test and pelvic mesh that would provide discretionary payment for the cost of additional need cause by the harm associate with those product the government response also reject that recommendation note patient have the right to take healthcare provider to court for clinical negligence or manufacturer to court for product liability it far explain on page while the government be sympathetic to the experience of those patient who give evidence to the report our primary focus be on improve future medicine and medical device safety it be therefore crucial that we focus government fund on initiative that directly improve future safety include specialist mesh centre and support for family affect by medicine in pregnancy for this reason redress scheme will not be establish in response to recommendation that be the situation in relation to the hapless individual who be at the wrong end of that particular nhs procedure more recently and before we have get as far as any inquiry into it we have be face with the prospect of have to deal with the scandal of all those young people who be live with the consequence of be give puberty blocker at the behest if not the recommendation of the nhs when sir chris whitty be ask about that on the radio early this week he seem totally unapologetic almost to the point of diffidence although he be insistent that we should do something about people who be engage in smoke tobacco or vape so another compensation issue will arise in relation to all those people who be persuade by the nhs to do the wrong thing one recommendation that do come out of the cumberlege review be for the establishment of this sound really great patient safety commissioner for england when in my capacity as chair of the all party parliamentary group on vaccine damage approach dr hughes and ask whether she would take up the case of the victim of vaccine she be very sympathetic but say and this come back to the issue of the culture that she have only the equivalent of one man and dog in her department she be be starve of the resource that would enable she to fulfil the remit that she have be give by the government which again be absolutely intolerable she explain that she do not have time to deal with the vaccine damage issue because perfectly reasonably she be concentrate on sodium valproate and pelvic mesh on february this year she publish her report set out further recommendation for redress in relation to those matter include recommendation for the creation of an independent redress scheme to provide both financial and non financial redress the government have not yet respond to that report perhaps the minister will respond to it today in february in response to parliamentary question the health minister responsible say the government be now carefully consider the recommendation and will respond substantively in due course that be just not good enough especially as the government seem to be rely on some very feeble initiative to which they have draw attention there be now this be exciting news madam deputy speaker new risk acknowledgment form to be complete by those for whom valproate be prescribe there be also claim gateway on the nhs resolution website for those wish to embark on clinical negligence claim the hughes report criticise these arrangement and criticise the claim gateway description because there be no new legal framework to enable people to engage in litigation and no guarantee of help with legal aid we hear that child who challenge the decision by north london comprehensive in relation to the wearing of religious symbol receive legal aid money amount to how be that possible when people who want redress because they have be do down by the national health service do not get anything at all in the foreword to her report dr hughes say the case for redress have already be make by the first do no harm review so my report would primarily focus on how to provide redress rather than why hope that in his response today the minister will accept that the government should now focus on how to provide redress rather than why redress be need in her foreword dr hughes also say all those we speak to have approach this process with openness and goodwill despite the considerable challenge they face as time progress these challenge intensify and understandably there be now grow sense of frustration and anger among patient confidence in the government to do the right thing be erode over the year while these patient have be suffer have see other healthcare scandal in this country rightly receive recognition and redress from thalidomide to vcjd and most recently the infected blood scandal fairness demand that those harm by valproate and pelvic mesh receive the recognition and redress to meet their need if the government agree with that why do they not say so now why be they continue to kick the can down the road and deny people access to the compensation that they rightfully deserve have speak for long than expect madam deputy speaker but as have say there be long history to this hope it will not be another year before another member of parliament for christchurch stand up and say year ago former member for christchurch be argue this very point in the house let we learn from history let we not be complacent let we get angry for action it be pleasure to follow the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope learn about many different redress scheme many of which have not even consider so he have do the house service this afternoon also congratulate the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord it be real pleasure to be able to speak in such an important debate and thank he for introduce it when injustice have occur and particularly in case of widespread injustice it be imperative that those who be wrong be provide with meaningful avenue of recourse proper justice can not be achieve until victim receive the redress to which they be entitle but as we have hear this afternoon time and again that simply do not happen what we often see be an excessively bureaucratic process administer by the party at fault move at snail pace while the victim redress be minimise and they continue to suffer indeed someone say to just today the folk in suit and boardroom always seem to benefit from the misery and hardship of other while the actual victim be last in the queue for redress the right hon member for north durham mr jones refer early to the number of lawyer who have benefit from the scandal involve post office ltd while the victim themselves have not receive proper compensation we be all painfully aware of the well document issue that have plague various compensatory scheme in the united kingdom other have already mention the windrush infect blood vaccination and of course the most widespread miscarriage of justice in british legal history the post office horizon scandal without proper redress justice be deny for victim who can not find closure for what be often deeply traumatic chapter of their life through my work as chair of the all party parliamentary group on post office be sadly all too familiar with the suffering of horizon victim who have shoulder the burden and have have to fight tooth and nail to get the financial redress they be entitle to despite everything they be still be subject to humiliating and derisory offer even alan bates who valiantly lead the campaign for justice for sub postmaster and take on the post office and win recently speak of the pitiful offer of redress he receive he highlight to the business and trade committee the perennial delay and the deadline miss by the post office and the government who be administer the three compensation scheme similarly campaigner christopher head the young horizon victim tell that the offer he receive be just tiny fraction of what he and government appoint forensic accountant have estimate he be entitle to regularly meet sub postmaster victim in motherwell and wishaw and to see the effect on individual at first hand be truly awful despite my repeatedly advise they to apply to the horizon shortfall scheme because many of they be not prosecute they want nothing to do with any of the scheme because they feel traumatised by what they have already go through and the thought of deal directly with post office ltd again cause they great hurt the application form for the redress scheme for horizon be legally complex even dan neidle legal expert have say that he would require legal advice when fill they out and the amount of money give by post office ltd to victim be derisory and token as have already be say however lawyer be make million of pound from the misery of other in addition post office ltd do not make it clear on the form that applicant could claim for damage to their reputation mean that many folk have already settle for far less than they should have far there be the absence of an option to claim punitive damage which mr neidle say lawyer would spot immediately but layperson would not and it be really difficult to come back on this shockingly post office ltd have continue to attempt to suppress the truth by warn sub postmaster who receive an offer under the hss that they could not legally mention compensation term to anyone include other applicant the press their family or their friend that be totally inaccurate and highlight the need for an independent adjudicator to provide oversight the minister have say on the floor of the house that no one will be pursue for speak about horizon compensation but that do not help someone who be already traumatise it take one of my constituent about year to admit that he have be pay into his post office and have take out another mortgage to try to cover the cost it be ridiculous that on top of everything else people be ask to sign non disclosure agreement an applicant to the hss have describe the process of try to get fair redress as soul destroy we have already hear that lee castleton have show that lawyer be make more money than the victim of horizon if any good have come out of the horizon it scandal it be that the affair have demonstrate the need for statutory guidance and for an independent oversight body to administer compensation scheme as have be call for already today for that reason support the motion the government must create statutory guidance with clear principle for operate redress scheme it will save victim of future scandal there will be future scandal from the additional pain and suffering that horizon infect blood windrush and vaccination victim have have to endure be hopeful about yesterday announcement of government amendment to the victims and prisoners bill that would establish an arm length body to administer the infected blood compensation scheme regulation around payment application procedure and appeal sincerely hope that the government be finally learn from the failure of redress scheme in the past last month the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report on women against state pension inequality find that thousand of woman bear in the be entitle to compensation that could and should lead to the payment en masse of financial redress to the waspi woman who have campaign tirelessly for year my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson have secure an important debate on redress for the waspi woman it be essential that any compensation scheme that be set up to remedy this injustice be administer fairly independently transparently and efficiently if lesson be not learn from the failure of redress scheme such as the one for horizon victim proper justice will not be achieve and thousand of victim will have be fail by the uk government again be look forward to hear the minister response agree with the hon member for christchurch that it be really difficult to understand why more mp be not here to stand up for their constituent regardless of whatever scandal they have be involve in and whatever compensation scheme to which they be look for redress hope the minister be listen carefully and hope to hear good response later on it be pleasure to follow the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows who have do fantastic work in this area on occasion we have be join at the hip in our approach to the post office thank the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord for open the debate which be very timely agree with the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope that it be disappointing that there be not more member here like he remember when thursdays be full day but now they seem to be optional extra for members of parliament that be show both my age and his declare an interest as member of the horizon compensation advisory board congratulate the appg on produce the report which identify the unbalanced power relationship when the citizen come up against the mighty state or corporate world we have compensation scheme when thing go wrong but to get to the truth in the first place usually take number of year the post office horizon scandal be good example so the victim have already fight to try to reach that point in many case the victim certainly those of the post office scandal and other too want compensation but most of those speak to also want the truth and an acknowledgment that they have be damage through no fault of their own in the case of the horizon scandal by the post office and in the case of some of the banking scandal by the disgraceful activity and greed of corporation as say it be regrettable that in most case the victim spend year try to get redress when there be public acknowledgment that something have go wrong they be usually at the back of the queue and forget about when compensation scheme be produce which be one of the issue that the appg report highlight when we be design compensation or redress scheme we should put the victim at the centre they be mainly over bureaucratic and complicated not just for the victim but for those try to administer they who in many case be try to do good job but get bogge down in the detail even when we try to take the lawyer out of the process one of the hurtful thing for many individual be that legal cost usually take up more of the financial pot than what go to the victim will talk little later about the horizon compensation scheme but the postal service minister the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake be try to cut through that knot by have single pot with fix sum that would not only make it easy for victim to understand the scheme but cut the duration and expense of legal proceeding both for the victim and for the government the minister have be criticise by some party for do that but think it be good step forward however even when we get scheme that we think should be easy to administer we get the greed of certain lawyer as the hon member for christchurch do be go to give historical example the mineworker compensation scheme in the end think that scheme pay out over billion for victim of vibration white finger and coal dust it should have be quite simple to administer because it have basically chart with the number of year that someone have work and the effect in term of the amount of damage that have be do but we see feeding frenzy of lawyer who not content that they be get their legal cost pay by the government prey upon the victim to deduct money from their compensation people might think that be bit of an anorak on this subject but that be one of my early campaign lord mann who be the hon member for bassetlaw at the time and expose the greed of not only the lawyer but sadly some trade union in my case the durham area of the national union of mineworkers these scheme should be quite simple to operate but every time we have scandal we go back to the drawing board and reinvent the wheel that think be the problem be not sure that we could design scheme that could cover every single instance but we could certainly have some foundation on which to build have see this at first hand on the advisory board give credit to the civil servant in the department for business energy and industrial strategy who be try to administer the scheme but they have go back to square one in the early day of the advisory board be actually refer back to the mineworker compensation scheme as way of try to simplify the system think that we need from the government in response to this report some work to look at get in place bare framework for compensation scheme that could be adopt when we get these type of scandal understand that in all this there be worry about the financial implication and sympathise with the minister because he have the treasury hover in the background however if we get to situation where we be pay out more in legal fee than to victim surely it would be simple to cut out the middleman and pay the money directly to the victim that framework which think the appg refer to need to be put in place as matter of urgency there be another thing that always strike which have see in the post office scandal frankly do not blame the victim do they trust the post office one iota no they do not would if have be through what they have be through no would not it seem that every time it be the people who be involve in the system who determine not only how the scheme be design but how it be administer find that appalling that be not just the case with the post office scandal it be true of some of the banking scandal too that have to change we can not have the people who create the problem try to administer the redress scheme because then victim do not trust what be go on will come to the historical shortfall scheme for the post office scandal in minute but my feeling look at how it have be administer by the post office be that it be design in the early day to try to reduce the amount of compensation so that the post office do not have to go to the treasury to fill the gap that be the complexity that we have generate we have fragmented and inconsistent system which lead to waste of money and frustration for the victim and slow thing down want to touch on couple of scheme will start with the post office horizon compensation scheme which know more about than some of the other we have three separate scheme and my fellow member of the advisory board ask why would we start here we all agree that we would not want to but we all feel that we could not unpick it and have one scheme because it have already be put in place we start off with the historical shortfall scheme which be design by the post office to try to get redress for some of the case that come forward but there be serious issue the first be with disclosure of evidence by the post office do not mind put it on record that on occasion think have it be lose or be they just frustrate the system think that it in some case it be just frustrating the system the second issue be that the post office be administer the scheme many individual be ask to make application without any legal advice at all and lo and behold the advisory board to be fair to the minister he have take on board our recommendation now have to look at some of those case again because of the way the scheme be administer right from the start it be not fit for purpose we then have the group litigation order scheme the famous include alan bates who take the post office to court and secure the landmark judgment that be completely separate scheme from the hss the glo scheme be initially resist at first the government line be that the postmaster have settle the case in the high court basically because they be outgunne by the government and the post office who use tsunami of public cash to spend million on lawyer but it be now come out of the inquiry that they never have case to defend they be try to defend the indefensible just think million spend on lawyer we could have pay the victim out of that we could have cover at least part of one of the scheme through that alone we understand victim anger when they see that happen we then have the overturn conviction scheme which come out of the or individual who have already be through the court of appeal and have their conviction overturn that will be the redress mechanism for all the other victim who will have their conviction quash when the legislation pass parliament that again will be different scheme from the other very early on the postal affair minister introduce the one off payment to people and he have now introduce payment in other scheme for people to accept as final offer without go through the evidence or anything like that people might say that that mean that some people will get more money than they lose that do not really bother give the trauma they have go through when the alternative be go through long laborious administration process we would pay as much as that out for lawyer anyway why should it not go to the victim credit to the postal service minister he have bring these payment forward we must try to have such payment in other compensation scheme we be in danger of have fourth scheme have meeting with the postal service minister last night and as have previously tell the house we be now look at the pre horizon scheme capture to be fair to he he be determined to get to the bottom of what the post office do in prosecute and bankrupt people if the government accept that victim be wrongly prosecute and in some case bankrupt which scheme do they fit into do they fit into one of the three exist scheme or will we have to generate yet another scheme that show the complexity of these argument when compensation be need would resist come up with fourth scheme we have to try to adapt some of the other scheme and we on the advisory board will obviously work with the minister lesson need to be learn from how the post office have handle this and that could be the basis for the cabinet office work in look at the pillar that be need all scheme and certainly the post office scheme have to disclose information the post office have be notoriously slow in disclose the information need to progress claim have some of that be deliberate in the past think it possibly have but what do we do where the record no long exist be sure some of the record no long exist in the example raise by the hon member for christchurch do we just say that no one have claim no think we need to take quite generous view if it can be prove for example that people have lose out because of the damage from scheme and if it can be prove that they be not just make it up we need mechanism to deal with that otherwise victim be go to feel that they will not get justice interestingly have more information on the pre horizon system capture than the post office do have full set of document all the software and all the floppy disk from the early capture case when put this to the post office be ask where get it from and say that one of the victim who contact have very assiduous wife sadly mrs tooby be no long with we who keep everything it say something that have more evidence than the post office the hon member for christchurch talk about litigation well how would person litigate that it be pretty one sided argument the post office have no evidence at all in those case it know that the evidence exist but it do not have the box of evidence that have again try to avoid litigation should be part of the process because as the hon gentleman say it be costly people do not have access to that kind of cash even if they do it be also costly to the government who win the lawyer and we do not get the swift redress that be need other scheme have be mention and evidence on the windrush scheme have be lose landing card record and other such thing have all be destroy by the home office so how do we do it we have to take sensible approach and to be fair to he know keep praise he the postal service minister have where the information do not exist we should err on the side of victim we should not say we can not move forward because we have no evidence that have be one of the problem with the windrush scandal have also work with lgbtq veteran who be dismiss from the armed force because of their sexuality which be great example of the government set the parameter of an inquiry before it be set up lord etherton do very good job with his inquiry but we have ridiculous situation in which the government say in advance that the compensation have to be cap at million keep ask why million apparently the only reason apart from the treasury want to keep control on expenditure be that the department see what the canadian scheme cost and say that it be roughly the same thing the government do that before set up the inquiry to be fair to lord etherton he have no choice but to recommend million have look at the case and meet some of the individual concern fight with pride be great organisation and there be no way that that compensation be go to be enough tell the minister for defence people that if he think he be go to get away with million it be completely for the bird people have lose wage pension entitlement and other thing that need to be take into consideration if we be not careful people will say actually it not worth go through this scheme we just litigate and go all the way that be another example of how the treasury or somebody else set limit beforehand be not good idea the other example be the infected blood inquiry the government argue that we have to take time to make sure we do it properly agree with all that but bluntly we know it be about save money and it be possibly about kick the inquiry until after the election in the hope that it will be somebody else problem be it go to be costly yes no amount of compensation will address the damage do to the contaminated blood victim and their family have read their testimony but it will help to right some of the wrong the government need to stop kick this football around and work on cross party basis to agree the way forward get into this through my constituent tom brown who be fantastic individual who fight very hard and with determination because he have not steal but he pass away before christmas as the hon member for tiverton and honiton say it be sad that people be die before they at least get some redress for the harm that be do that can not be right many more infected blood victim will pass away before they get compensation follow the appg excellent report we need to build the pillar of framework that can be put in place for such scandal that should apply not only to the government but to the corporate world too my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier chair the public accounts committee which be look at this and we need to change the treasury mind on accept that we will have more of these scandal in the future whether we like it or not we should be mindful of that in the account by put consolidated funding aside for these type of compensation scheme if we have that framework and that treasury thinking of keep that money aside we could at least then not keep reinvent thing which be what we be do the sadness be that we keep make the same mistake over and over again which be unjust for the victim inefficient for government and just feed those in the legal profession sorry to keep have go at lawyer to point where they get more than the victim which can not be right we have to approach this issue as the all party group do on cross party basis as it be go to affect not just this government but future government most people across the house would want we to have system that ensure that people get compensate when thing go wrong so some consensus across the house in design such system or framework would be worth get if we could do that we would show the public something that go to the point the hon member for christchurch make people may say that the government and parliament can not do thing but we can if we get our act together and work across the party to get what we all need which be redress for the these individual it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for north durham mr jones do so with small measure of trepidation as recover lawyer it be year since leave legal practice so it give certain perspective he be right to say that we be talk about the imbalance of power between the big corporate government body and public body and the individual private citizen beyond that the real problem be about culture because nothing in nature or law say that big corporate public regulator or public body have to treat people badly that be the choice of the people who make up those body that problem be not new as have be listen to this debate have be reflect on the fact that not long after be first elect to this house in one of the first piece of casework in which become involved relate to resident in the south end of shetland whose asbestos roof have all fail follow the grounding of the braer off the south end of shetland some year early the casual observer might think it common sense that those roof have work perfectly functionally for decade and then suddenly after tanker full of gullfaks crude be dump on top of they thing start to go wrong the problem be that they do not go wrong immediately it take time for their failure to become apparent as consequence those people be at the tail end of those who be claim from the international oil pollution compensation funds everybody believe before the braer that the sum put into the iopc fund could never be reach but of course the braer maxe out the fund by the time the asbestos roof claimant come along there be no money leave to pay the compensation however money be leave to defend court action which be what happen when my constituent raise one have never understand the judgment in the case but my constituent lose and as consequence be leave have to carry their own loss be certain that have there be more money in that fund at the start their loss would have be meet so yes this be about the imbalance of power but it be also about the culture of the organisation concern an understanding be require on the part of these body be they corporate or public of the purpose for which they be there that be what wish to draw the house attention to today last night be fortunate to host showing upstairs of bbc documentary entitle king of the swindlers and the parallel with the post office horizon scheme and its victim be there for all to see there be only couple of hundred victim of the king of the swindlers whereas as we know thousand of sub postmaster be affect by horizon the king of the swindlers concern ponzi scheme perpetrate by financial adviser in the north east of scotland alistair greig he be eventually convict of fraud and sentence to year imprisonment which be later reduce to on appeal the victim come from everywhere from shetland in the north down through orkney along the highland east coast and the moray coast through aberdeen and down into angus they be all people who have live and work as builder tradesman or shopkeeper save bit here and there they put their money into this ponzi scheme and lose out the constituent who first bring this to my attention lose out to the tune of and his mother lose alistair greig be responsible for his fraud but he be able to carry it out as consequence of the serial ineptitude and incompetence of the financial services authority later the financial conduct authority journalist dale haslam of aberdeen evening express who have do tremendous work expose what go on point out to last night that if the fsa have get it right the first time greig wrongdoing be bring to its attention he would have be stop after only one victim however it miss the opportunity not once not twice but three time to stop what he be do as consequence the number of victim run to hundred those who lose out be all small business people who have work hard save here and or there they put all that money together and trust it to alistair greig usually on the recommendation of friend family and other because that be how business be often do in such community these people do not make that money by flip property or come up with great wheeze in the city it be all hard win eventually in desperation they raise legal action against sense network ltd the company that stand above greig in the financial food chain but they lose twice in the first instance and at appeal the legal action pursue by the victim who have the determination courage and stubbornness to pursue it do serve purpose eventually all the victim be allow compensation from the financial services compensation scheme that of course come with an cap so my constituent who have lose be immediately down however those victim of alistair greig who support the legal action and make the compensation for everybody possible be leave with legal fee bill of million they be have to pay some each although the exact number vary so my constituent start with come down to and be leave with something in the region of let we not lose sight of the fact that alistair greig be able to do what he do only because the financial services authority and the financial compensation authority be poor at do the job that this house charge they to do invite various people to the screening of king of the swindlers last night invite the legal team include the solicitor who act for the victim will be happy to introduce she to the right hon member for north durham because she be sterling example of what good people in the legal profession can do as member of what would still regard as caring profession hate to think that have give the impression that be down on all lawyer some of my good friend be lawyer if the system be implement fairly people can get proper legal advice without it cost fortune do not disagree with that see enough of that in my time in practice the right hon gentleman know of my experience with the historical shortfall scheme and of go into hand to hand combat with the lawyer who be instruct by the post office in that case we be able to make progress for my constituent local solicitor anne robertson sole practitioner operate in orkney take on one of the three big firm in london and leave they run for cover the victim be leave with million legal fee because the inadequacy of the regulator leave they with no option but to do what they do we invite the regulator to the showing last night invite they in the middle of march they reply last week in letter say no sorry we have nothing to add we be not go to come foolishly the fca give time to reply and have telephone conversation on friday night as leave shetland on ferry to go to orkney with chris wilford the head of public affair and mark francis the director of enforcement and market oversight apparently that be proper job title think it be some sort of ironic term but that be what be in his contract the response be of course we be accountable but we do like be accountable to you this be an informal process all be ask be for they to come along sit in room and watch documentary along with the people who have lose their life saving to this man and explain the decision that they have take that be all they have to do they could walk out of the room at the end of the night and would be able to ask no more of they but they be not even prepared to do that think would be up against some really slick type but have rarely come across two more nervous sound individual it be your reputation it precede you that could be right but doubt it my reputation be as friendly and approachable character we go through the process and eventually say if these people have not take that court action how much would any victim of alistair greig have get back the silence be absolutely deafening let it run for as long as could and eventually say well think understand now why you be so reluctant to come to the house of commons next wednesday the call do not go on much after that but do say that think that the matter require escalation and ask they to call back on monday with arrangement for to speak to the chief executive do not get call but do get an email on monday say that they have nothing furth to add the chief executive of the financial conduct authority be nikhil rathi interestingly couple of year ago that job command salary of per annum calculate that the prime minister salary be about of what we pay the chief executive of the fca for job like that it often feel that the more you pay the less you get contrast the lack of moral courage of people like that who will not sit in room with the people whose life have be affect by the decision they have take to that of some of the people who be in the room last night include the solicitor philippa hann and robert morfee at first the judge in the sense network case be not go to turn up but he be there in the room we expect judge to plead the independence of the judiciary and rightly so but out of respect for what these people have be though he be prepared to turn up watch the documentary and share the space with they that speak well to his strength of character another person who be in the room be judy greig the ex wife of alistair greig who be responsible for the scheme she divorce he after his crime come to light he make himself bankrupt but she refuse to do that so she have end up carry some of his debt she be now year old she be work in supermarket and still support the victim of her husband criminality her remarkable strength of character be in contrast to that of people like the chief executive of the fca who despite the very well fund taxpayer salary that they get simply lack the decency and moral courage to sit down in room with their victim that be why think that the question of culture be at the root of the issue since become interested in the last few day in the detail of what be go on in the fca have find very little to offer comfort apparently the fca say that of its staff be earn salary below the per year set by the joseph rowntree foundation as the minimum amount that people need to earn to reach an acceptable standard of living it be possibility that the fca will establish its own hardship fund in if there be enough demand among staff this be an organisation where the chief executive be pay year some of the commentary on the culture in the fca be pretty damning in one anonymous online report former colleague describe the ceo as very high iq but not as much eq emotional quotient as we know culture come from the top of an organisation downwards unite the union that represent many fca worker talk about the toxic environment for staff representative who have be give minimal information by their boss again this come down to culture how the fca treat its staff read across to how it treat people like my constituent who find themselves in need of its service we set up the fca for reason and the fscs for another reason the fscs be only suppose to be there in case the fca fail in any way it be pay for by company in the financial service sector which be regulate so they pay for the regulation and for the failure of that regulation this be something that the government seriously need to look at soon in the meantime if the fca want to do anything to persuade or anybody else in this house that be wrong about the culture within that organisation it can put the final sum of million in cheque to the claimant who be the victim of alistair greig and midas financial solutions call the snp spokesperson thank all hon member for very thoughtful debate this afternoon have enjoy all the contribution which have raise some very important injustice will confine my observation to four issue windrush the women against state pension inequality campaign or the bear woman horizon and the infected blood scandal each one have cause hardship each one have be scandalous include in the way that people catch up in these scandal have be treat and be give warm word but very little action all involve miscarriage of justice and because of the delay in redress we find that many victim be unfortunately no long with we because they have wait so long we should take some time to reflect on that during this debate there be people who have just not see that justice not see that redress and not see that compensation first let turn to the waspi woman we welcome the publication of the long overdue report by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman which have find failing by the department for work and pensions and have rule that the woman affect be owe compensation however it be staggering that as the chief executive of that organisation say the department for work and pensions have clearly indicate that it will refuse to comply that be unacceptable the department must do the right thing and it must be hold to account for any failure to do so believe that if the will of this house be test on that issue it will join all of we who believe that the department for work and pensions must acknowledge its failing and urgently deliver fast and fair compensation scheme for the woman affect member could of course support the private member bill in the name of my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown who be try to force the government to publish proposal for that compensation scheme for woman bear in the we also have the windrush scandal just like so many other issue that have be raise by hon member today it be shameful that people have be wait so long for compensation from the government and that people have sadly pass away in the meantime this year mark the fifth anniversary since the launch of the windrush compensation scheme yet nearly claim from the windrush scandal be still to be settle by the home office great grandfather who have help advise thousand of victim of the windrush scandal on compensation have say that he fear that the government be wait for we to die off hear that phrase all too often when discuss issue such this there be real sense from people that they believe that the government be wait for the victim to die off the windrush compensation scheme have be painfully slow with people have die while their claim be be process do the hon gentleman agree that the delay also add extra heartache not just because the individual have sadly die but because then there be usually legacy case which be pass on in will and that then lead to further complication far delay and further agony for the family involve be delighted that the right hon gentleman have make that perceptive point when the other place discuss the amendment in relation to infected blood that be the sort of debate that it be go to have it be the government intention that the estate will be pay but what the right hon gentleman say will confuse matter both the other place and this place will have to think about what that will mean the other issue with the windrush scandal be that the home office be in charge of the compensation scheme an independent body should administer that scheme the government try to do something similar with the infected blood scandal when they be very resistant to an independent arm length body be set up despite sir brian langstaff recommendation it be clear that the government be nervous about that the only reason that they table their amendment in the other place in relation to an independent compensation scheme in that particular scenario be that the will of the house force the government to accept an amendment to set up that independent body do hope the government will consider set up an independent organisation to administer the windrush compensation scheme as that be far well position to take as have mention infected blood madam deputy speaker let say that welcome in part the amendment that have be table in the other place what be miss from that amendment be timetable people be wait for justice they need that timetable to know what be go to happen it be unfortunate that the government have not build on the amendment that be pass in this place through the victims and prisoners bill there be be afraid concern that the government amendment in the other place be water that down wish to pay tribute once again to constituent who have be affect by the infected blood scandal affect by windrush and involve in the waspi woman case the last case that will mention be the post office scandal before the hon gentleman move on to his last point do he agree with that trust in politic have take real dive the cover up and then the length of time that it take to address the case of wrongdoing only far harm the public trust in politic and politician in the case of the equitable life scandal despite the ombudsman say that people should receive full compensation around of victim have still only receive of what the government have acknowledge that they be owe that be despite the ombudsman make it clear that finite resource should not get in the way do he agree that an independent agency be vital to stop the public trust erode even far think that be true get the sense that there be an anti politic feel out there that be not just direct at some individual it be systematic issue think that people get very frustrated at the systematic delay that can take place in order to find redress wish to pay tribute to my hon friend the member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows and to the right hon member for north durham mr jones who have do fantastic work in highlight the horizon scandal do hope that the government act swiftly because we have to remember that sub postmaster have die without see justice believe that justice for all be vital because justice delay be justice deny order before call the shadow minister just want to emphasise to those who might be want to participate in the next debate how important it be to get back for all the wind up include that of the snp spokesperson it be rather discourteous not to do so thank you congratulate the hon member who secure this debate and the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord who open it and raise some very important issue in respect of deliver appropriate redress scheme in timely manner today we have hear from the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope about vaccine damage and from the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows about the post office and the constraint of non disclosure agreement my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones have bring his expertise and track record of campaign to the chamber to speak on the post office and the miner compensation scheme and we hear from the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael on save scheme and the miss opportunity by the watchdog to prevent people from become victim of that scheme by definition those who be eligible for redress scheme will already have suffer detriment and many as we have see with the infected blood scandal and the post office horizon scandal will have spend year battle for recognition and justice and suffer avoidable hardship we therefore owe it to they to ensure that we get the redress scheme right and that they be set up as promptly as possible and operate as efficiently as possible while ensure that we protect the public purse from fraudulent claim learn from previous scheme so that we be not constantly reinvent the wheel or repeat mistake and build up corporate expertise be therefore of vital importance each scheme will however have its own complexity and sensitivity and it be important that they be fully recognise as my right hon friend the member for north durham highlight victim should be at the centre of design redress scheme the national audit office produce briefing in build on the experience of some previous compensation scheme such as the miner chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and vibration white finger scheme which be all too familiar to my right hon friend to and to other colleague who represent former coalmining area the nao briefing stress the importance of the right governance and project management commit sufficient effort and appropriate skill to set up scheme consider the capacity need design out the likely bottleneck or delay and be prepared to deal with external pressure there may well be further lesson to learn since then in january my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier who chair the public accounts committee ask the national audit office to conduct thematic review of government compensation and financial redress scheme and the national audit office agree to do so look forward to read that report sadly as we have see in instance such as hillsborough the infected blood scandal and the post office horizon scandal long before get to any form of redress scheme actually get to the truth in the first place can be an uphill struggle with victim vilify sham shun imprison and financially ruin on december last year when the government publish their response to the hillsborough report the opposition along with the victim family be bitterly disappointed that the government stop short of propose hillsborough law which be why raise it at prime minister question that day this week we mark the anniversary of hillsborough tragedy as hon member will have hear my right hon friend the leader of the opposition raise the propose law again with the prime minister yesterday but we still receive no positive response the purpose of hillsborough law would be to prevent such hideous cover up by the authority which be an appalling affront to the survivor and the devastated family of those who die and leave they have to struggle for far long to get justice the purpose of the propose hillsborough law would be to put legal responsibility on public official to tell the truth in any form of formal inquiry or proceeding and to ensure that individual would face criminal sanction if they breach that law to be honest it be extraordinary that that be not already the case importantly the propose hillsborough law would also provide victim with parity of legal funding in inquest that would avoid the sort of david and goliath situation where victim simply can not afford to challenge the authority all public body need to be open minded and even handed when consider complaint or hearing from whistleblower and not rush to cover up and silence concern and hound whistleblower out of organisation those in charge of public body need to contemplate the thought that mistake may have be make system may be at fault and there may be individual who do not hold to the ideal of public service or inappropriate culture within an organisation often early recognition and acknowledgment of problem could help to bring justice soon to victim prevent further victim and ultimately save the public purse instead it seem to take year of struggle heartbreak investigative journalism and even tv drama before the victim voice be hear and believe and justice be deliver in term of whistleblower think of the senior paediatrician in the letby case who raise concern even though he be senior paediatrician his concern be dismiss and letby go on to murder again all the more tragic because it could have be avoid to return to the redress scheme it be all very well look at good practice and try to build on previous experience to streamline matter and avoid reinvent the wheel skilled civil servant can have the very good guideline in the world but without political will from the government to prioritise victim will continue to wait and sadly some may never live to receive their compensation on whether people survive to get justice draw attention to baroness cumberlege first do no harm report on the harm cause by mesh sodium valproate and primodo lot of those victim be already die my mam be one of the victim of mesh she will be in january and hope that she live to see some compensation and redress do my hon friend agree that these thing really have to be speed up because it be not fair when people have be harm in this case by the state through medical intervention redress should be forthcoming quickly indeed my hon friend make an important point recently the government have dither and delay on three high profile redress scheme will turn first to the windrush scandal which reveal the huge injustice in our citizenship and nationality system the scheme be set up in but home affairs committee report in point out that in early the average time from claim to payment be some day even in february this year the home office own datum show that some of live claim be drag on for more than six month as we have make clear in this house labour be determined to ensure that the windrush generation and family get the compensation and justice that they be owe if necessary we would place the windrush compensation scheme outside the home office if it continue to fail labour have plan to restart and improve community engagement and outreach work to encourage application to the scheme and speed up compensation payment to ensure that every victim get every penny of the compensation that they deserve as part of our commitment to the recommendation of the wendy williams review labour would establish windrush commissioner to monitor the compensation scheme and the re establishment of the major change programme and the windrush unit within the home office and to be voice for the family affect to ensure that scandal like windrush can never happen again my heart drop at the idea of another commissioner the point which my hon friend make early be that we need ministers who will drive thing forward good example be the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who on number of occasion have call poacher turn gamekeeper he do excellent work on the banking scandal and he have drive thing forward because he be minister who actually care about the victim and be prepared to make tough decision within government indeed without political will thing can not be drive forward as my right hon friend say ministerial intervention be crucial turn to the infected blood scandal the opposition be disturb to hear the news yesterday evening that the government be yet again delay the compensation scheme by try to remove from the victims and prisoners bill requirement to set one up within three month of the bill become law yet another miss opportunity yet another delay in sir robert francis kc produce his report compensation and redress for the victims of infected blood recommendations for framework in april last year whole year ago sir brian langstaff produce his second interim report of the infected blood inquiry as the minister know there be absolutely no reason why the government can not go ahead with set up scheme before the publication of the final report on may time be of the essence every week that pass without further government action matter those who be infect with contaminate blood be die at rate of one every four day the labour party want to ensure that justice and compensation for victim and their family be deliver as matter of the utmost urgency but we have still not hear the government final decision on compensation they tell we that they will not make public any final detail until after the publication of the final report in may urge they yet again to speed up the process of deliver justice to victim and their family include by get on with the work need to set up the structure of the compensation scheme so that victim be compensate as soon as possible the post office horizon system offences bill afford we the chance to make huge stride in right the wrong of the past and we on the labour benches be pleased to give it our full support this have be an interesting and informative debate the government should always try to learn from past experience and do their utmost to get redress scheme right make they transparent and easily accessible to victim while protect the public purse it be pleasure to respond to thoughtful debate in which we have hear some very good speech hon member have have the opportunity to display the considerable expertise that they have build up often while deal with difficult constituency casework it be reminder to we all that we be here to serve the need of our constituent and to help they find redress when hardship difficulty and sometimes the system get in their way it be pleasure to hear experienced member of the house hark back to the glorious day when we have full work thursday share their desire for that and not just because we would have have more people in attendance for this debate it be particularly good to hear the consider speech of right hon member for north durham mr jones in which he savagely attack lawyer look forward to the leader of his party reading and consider his remark we be here to debate the detail that have be raise thank to the diligent effort of the all party parliamentary group in write to the government with its thought about how we might make general improvement the government firmly believe that access to redress be fundamental in uphold justice and fairness in our society it be imperative that individual have avenue to seek recourse when they have be wrong or harm in recognition of that the scheme through which the government provide redress be numerous the government have do more than most in the past few year to address historical wrong in the infected blood inquiry be set up and in october interim payment of be make to everyone in the uk infect blood support scheme the windrush programme be set up in the horizon shortfall scheme in the overturn conviction scheme and the lgbt veteran scheme in and the group litigation order compensation scheme in yesterday my right hon friend the paymaster general set out our next step in support the victim of the infected blood scandal the government have be steadfast in our commitment to provide diverse compensation scheme that cater to vary need and circumstance we remain committed to uphold the rule of law and ensure that all citizen have access to effective mechanism for resolve grievance and hold institution accountable there be rightly considerable interest across the house in how we can ensure good practice be grateful to be able to engage with some of those idea today although acknowledge the interesting idea moot by the appg think we should sound note of caution we must be wary of any approach that would set up uniform system for redress and compensation each set of circumstance be often very different and scheme need to be capable of reflect those difference in order to ensure that the affected individual get the good possible redress any reform process would need to ensure that we do not lose personal understanding of the claimant who be access the scheme and that we provide adequate support and understanding of their personal experience urge hon member to keep claimant at the centre of our thinking during consideration of any reform that have be at the heart of what hon member have say in the debate do not disagree with the minister agree that victim should be at the centre and that no two scheme will ever be perfectly the same but there be broad framework what tend to happen it certainly do with the horizon scheme be that people try to reinvent the thing every time surely we could put in place some parameter that civil servant could use as template when face with future compensation scheme be go to come to that point although the right hon gentleman be right that there be currently no public guidance that do not limit the sharing of knowledge between departments and policy area there be great deal of dialogue and share learning between official when scheme come into existence the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord suggest in his opening remark that the wheel be always be reinvent that be not the case learning process happen within government do not suppose that lesson be not be learn and that one set of civil servant be not pass lesson on to another set rather this be about victim have the reassurance that when there be perceive conflict of interest they have somewhere else to go the point be make be very much that we have internal scheme of learning and we ensure that each new scheme learn from the experience of those that have go before it rise will give way one more time to the right hon gentleman but be run out of time that be not my experience when we be set up the advisory board for the horizon compensation scheme ask official to look at the mineworker compensation scheme which be massive scheme the problem be that with the turnover of civil servant corporate knowledge be lose we need corporate knowledge to be hold centrally in departments possibly in the cabinet office otherwise thing leave to departments do not happen because people leave the right hon gentleman be right the government require mean of retain corporate knowledge that be something that have be work on since come to the cabinet office month ago will not go into it now but we be put in place number of novel programme to ensure that as people move on we retain their learning not just with regard to redress scheme but more broadly across government he be right about that although there be richness in have civil servant who have work in many different departments and have broad understanding of how government work there be sometimes danger that in have that rotation we lose expert knowledge will move on to some of the progress that have be make on the major scheme that the government have under way in respect of the horizon it scandal let reassure the house that the government be determine for postmaster to receive the compensation that they deserve as of march this year approximately million have be pay to over claimant across three scheme million on the horizon shortfall scheme million for all payment include interim payment on the group litigation order scheme and total of million for all payment include further interim payment on the overturn conviction scheme with regard to the windrush scandal as of february this year the home office have pay over million across claim on infected blood as mention early the government have pay over million in interim compensation to those infected and bereaved partner register with exist support scheme since let turn to the specific point make by other contributor alas my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope ascribe to great power than possess be unable today to respond formally to the cumberlege review but he will be aware that the government be in the midst of very serious consideration of its finding and recommendation and know that he will hold our foot to the fire to ensure that that formal response come soon to go back one more time to the right hon member for north durham be grateful for his acknowledgment of the work do by my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake his comment about lawyer aside very much agree that we need scheme that reduce the opportunity for legal opportunism we owe that to our tax pay constituent and also to those who have be wrong the government understand that there be broad lesson to be learn from scheme that have go on in the past but also from the four big scheme that be currently under way it will also be necessary for we to consider the response of the national audit office to the letter write early this year by the chair of the public accounts committee the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier so that we can well understand how we can build on the good work that have already be do to help our constituent when similar wrong befall they in future be very grateful to all member who have participate in today debate often prompt by conversation that they have have with individual in their constituency and therefore often pay great heed to just one person case in recent year there have be one or two positive development on access compensation for example the interim compensation award that we hear about have help to speed up redress but there be still some serious problem that be common to so many of the case that we have use to highlight the problem this afternoon we can no long have the same organisation that be responsible for the original harm also responsible for adjudicate what be fair compensation even in case where there be not conflict of interest victim might perceive that there be and as we have hear they have nowhere else to go so there need to be the right of appeal we can not have the ludicrous situation in which an individual or small business who be subject to mis selling for example have no recourse but to go back to the very bank that lend they the money in the first place we need an independent expert arm length body that could oversee redress scheme and would provide cost effective way to tackle mass scandal it would ensure speedy resolution that place the burden on those who commit the wrongdoing not the victim who be catch up in these appalling situation the recommendation of the appg on fair business banking be an excellent way of introduce that framework conclude by thank all member who take part in today debate question put and agree to resolve that this house recognise the challenge face by individual and business in access effective dispute resolution and obtain redress in case of injustice believe that the government need to address these specific challenge namely fragmented and inconsistent redress landscape consider statutory guidance to be an essential measure to ensure compensation and redress scheme follow common principle and lead to fair and independent outcome and call on the government to create statutory guidance with common principle for set up and operate redress scheme response and excess death relevant document petition launch public inquiry into excess mortality in england and wales petition investigate uk excess death not relate to covid beg to move that this house have consider the pandemic response and trend in excess death and call on the inquiry to move onto its module investigation into vaccine and therapeutic as soon as possible we be witness to the great medical scandal in this country in live memory and possibly ever the excess death in and its cause be complex but the novel and untested medical treatment describe as covid vaccine be large part of the problem have be call an anti vaxxer as if have reject those vaccine base on some ideology want to state clearly and unequivocally that have not in fact be double vaccinated and vaccine harm intelligent people must be able to tell when people be neither pro vax nor anti vax but be against product that do not work and cause enormous harm to percentage of the people who take it be proud to be one of the few member of parliament with science degree it be great shame that there be not more member with science background in this place maybe if there be there would be less reliance on whips office briefing and more independent research and perhaps less group think say to the house in all seriousness that this debate and other like it be go to be pore over by future generation who will be genuinely agog that the evidence have be ignore for so long that genuine concern be disregard and that those raise they be gaslit smear and vilify one do not need any science training at all to be horrify by official deliberately hide key datum in this scandal which be exactly what be go on the office for national statistics use to release weekly datum on death per in vaccinate and unvaccinated population it no long do so and no one will explain why the public have right to that datum there have be call from serious expert whose request have amplify repeatedly in this house for what be call record level datum to be anonymise and disclose for analysis that would allow meaningful analysis of death after vaccination and settle once and for all the issue of whether those experimental treatment be responsible for the increase in excess death far more extensive and detailed datum have already be release to the pharma company from publicly fund body jenny harries head of the uk health security agency say that this anonymised aggregate death by vaccination status datum be commercially sensitive and should not be publish the public be be deny that datum which be unacceptable yet again datum be hide with impunity just like in the post office scandal professor harries have also endorse recent massive change to the calculation of the baseline population level use by the ons to calculate excess death it be now incredibly complex and opaque and by sheer coincidence it appear to show massive excess of death in and and minimal excess death in under the old calculation method try and test for decade the excess death rate in be an astonishing after the pandemic be over at time when we would expect deficit in death because so many people have sadly die in previous year some premature death in alone be now be airbrush away through the new normal baseline shocking thing happen during the pandemic response in march the government conduct consultation exercise on whether people over certain age or with certain disability should have do not resuscitate order know as dnr impose upon they document summarise the proposal be circulate to doctor and hospital it be mistakenly treat as formal policy by number of care home and gps up and down the country who enact it at the same time multiple hospital introduce policy that they would not admit patient with dnr because they think that they would be overwhelm the result be that people die who do not need to die while nurse perform tiktok dance the average time to death from experience covid symptom and testing positive be day it be little know fact that the body clear all the virus within around seven day what actually kill people be that some especially the vulnerable have an excessive immune response doctor have be treat that response for decade with steroid antibiotic for secondary pneumonia infection and other standard protocol but they do not do so this time even though the virus be long go doctor abandon the standard clinical protocol because covid be new it be not they send people home tell they to take paracetamol until their lip turn blue and then when those people return to hospital they sedate they put they on ventilator and watch they die the protocol for treatment be binary choice between two treatment track once admit ill patient be either ventilate in intensive care or if they be not fit for that level of care give end of life medication include midazolam and morphine the body responsible for that protocol which be publish on april be call the national institute for health and care excellence or nice give midazolam and morphine to people die of cancer be reasonable but there be side effect which be that those drug have respiratory depressant effect it be hard to imagine more stupid thing to do than give respiratory suppressant to someone who be already struggle to breathe with the symptom of but that be exactly what we do can the minister explain why midazolam be remove from the same update guideline the antecedent of on november as it be remove be it now consider and admit that it be mistake to ignore the warning of so many expert about include that specific drug midazolam in when it be introduce it have be confirm in letter from ministers to family whose loss of love one be down to this protocol that minister be now say that doctor and nurse should have treat the individual patient with their own knowledge rather than strictly follow nice guideline if legal case for unlawful killing be bring can the minister tell we who be go to be take the blame will it be nice will it be nhs england or will the individual doctor and nurse be hold to account interestingly nice have now remove these alternative protocol include from its website although every other historical protocol be still there for reference could the minister tell we why nice have remove this protocol from its website be it ashamed of the harm it have cause it certainly should be what can we learn from this we learn that very few doctor dare challenge what they be tell protocol with no author be distribute and doctor fall into line there be huge stark contrast in how death and illness after vaccination have be record compare with those after covid after positive covid test any illness and any death be attribute to the virus after the experimental emergency vaccine be administer no subsequent illness and no death be ever attribute to the vaccine those be both completely unscientific approach and that be why we have to look at other source of datum excess death to determine whether there be an issue first however want to address the phrase safe and effective the fear deliberately stoke up by the government promote the idea of be rescue by saviour vaccine the chanting of the safe and effective narrative begin and the phrase seem to hypnotise the whole nation safe and effective be the sale slogan of thalidomide after that scandal rule be put in place to prevent such marketing in future by pharma company and they be prohibit from use safe and effective without significant caveat that do not matter this time because with vaccine the medium the government and other authority turn into big pharma marketing department and it be very hard now to hear the word safe without the echo of the word and effective but they be not safe and effective in march when the majority of uk citizen have already receive these novel product pfizer sign contract with brazil and south africa say that the long term effect and eﬃcacy of the vaccine be not currently know and adverse eﬀect of the vaccine be not currently know that be verbatim from the pfizer contract these so call vaccine be the least effective vaccine ever be there anyone leave under any illusion that they prevent any infection when he be at the dispatch box for prime minister question on january even the prime minister in answer to my question could not bring himself to add and effective to his safe mantra in his own word he be unequivocal that the vaccine be safe the word safe mean without risk of death or injury why be the prime minister gaslighte the successful claim make to the vaccine damage payment scheme total million in compensation for harm cause by the covid vaccine have these people not suffer enough already those victim be the tip of the iceberg by the way it also should be note that the maximum payment be only so each of those victim get the maximum possible award which should tell we something the same compensation scheme pay out total of only million between and with an average of only eight claim per year and that be for all claim for the entire country for all vaccine administer so much for safe how about effective on october the then prime minister the right hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip boris johnson even admit that the vaccine do protect you against catch the disease and it do protect you against pass it on look at the level of the virus find in sewage show that the post vaccine wave be of the same order of magnitude and duration as the previous wave this prove that the vaccine change nothing they be not safe and they be not effective those who impose these vaccine know full well that they could never prevent infection from disease of this kind an injection in the arm can not do that only immunity on the surface of the airway and the lung can prevent viral infection antibodie in the blood can not in dr anthony fauci word it be not surprising that none of the predominantly mucosal respiratory virus have ever be effectively control by vaccine he continue this observation raise question of fundamental importance if natural mucosal respiratory virus infection do not elicit complete and long term protective immunity against reinfection how can we expect vaccine especially systemically administer non replicate vaccine to do so they know that the so call vaccine would never protect from infection which explain why they never test for protection from infection only few day ago the association of the british pharmaceutical industry rap pfizer on the knuckle for the sixth time and say that its marketing practice have bring the industry into disrepute it be ask to pay paltry in administrative expense with no fine on top the person head the abpi at the moment be also the head of pfizer uk the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency have statutory duty to carry out this work and it have hand its responsibility to the industry this be an outrageous conflict of interest let we turn back to excess death the australian government have launch an inquiry into australia excess death problem australia be almost unique as case study for excess death as it have the vaccine before it have covid its excess death be not so easily blame on the long term side effect of virus like we it see rise in death which begin in may and have not let up since the impact be evident on the ambulance service first south australia see increase in cardiac presentation of to year old that increase peak in november before covid hit we see similar deeply worrying effect here in the uk call for life threaten emergency rise from per day to per day in may and that number have never return to normal by october despite it be springtime in australia headline report that ambulance be unable to drop off patient in hospital which be already at full capacity mark mcgowan premier of western australia say that he could not explain the overwhelmed hospital our hospital be under enormous pressure this have be something no one have ever see before why it be be hard to know in april yvette queensland health minister say about the most urgent ambulance call call code one do think anyone can explain why we see jump in code one we just have lot of heart attack and chest pain and trouble breathing respiratory issue sometimes you can explain why those thing happen but unfortunately they do think we could explain this if we be to look at the link to the vaccine roll out omicron do cause some excess death in australia from onwards however there be huge chunk of excess death prior to that which doctor have not be able to blame on the virus could those death be cause by the vaccine very few people dare even ask that question it be important to remember how the vaccine be make traditionally the key to make vaccine be to ensure that the pathological harmful part of the virus or bacteria be inactivate so that the recipient can develop an immune response without danger of develop the disease in stark contrast the so call covid vaccine use the most pathological or harmful part of the virus the spike protein in its entirety the harm be systemic because contrary to what everyone be tell the lipid nanoparticle encapsulate the genetic material spread through the whole body after injection potentially affect all organ at the time everyone be be reassure that the injection be break down in the arm at the injection site regulator ought to have know that those be problem furthermore it be now plentifully evident that the drug result in continued spike protein production for many month even year in some people the death thus far have be predominantly cardiac but there may unfortunately be many more death to come from these novel treatment which may induce extra cancer death dr robert tindle be the retired director of the clinical medical virology centre in brisbane and emeritus professor of immunology this month he publish paper highlight the multiple potential harm from the vaccine include harm to the immune system as anyone who know anything about biology will know anything that disrupt the immune system can potentially increase the risk of cancer there be other reason to be concern about cancer be induce by these vaccine cancer be genetic disease disorder that arise from error in dna allow cell to grow uncontrollably moderna have multiple patent describe method for reduce the risk of cancer induction from its mrna product that risk come from the material interrupt the patient dna it turn out that an mrna injection have very high quantity of dna in it and that massively increase the risk of disturb patient own dna bad still the dna that be inject contain sequence that be hide from the regulator that be the or simian virus promoter region which have be link to cancer and have be find in the pfizer vaccine that be no accident yet again crucial information be hide from the regulator and the public with absolute impunity an independent study in japan publish last week have find link between increase cancer rate in japan and those who take the first and subsequent booster vaccine perhaps that explain why pfizer acquire cancer treatment company for report billion early this year in conclusion the evidence be clear these vaccine have cause death despite that they have be describe as safe and effective however for proportion of people who take they the vaccine have cause serious harm and death and they will have raise the risk of cancer for many more nor be they effective the vaccine do not prevent infection or transmission and when the data be look at objectively it show that the vaccine do not prevent serious illness or death those be hard truth to face but we must face they if we want to learn the lesson of the last few year at some point we will have to face up to all the evidence that be build it be fairly convincing month ago when first speak out but it be unequivocal now it be time to take the politic out of our science and to put actual science back into our politic ask the house to support the motion today and for baroness hallett inquiry to open module on the safety and efficacy of the experimental vaccine give the evidence call on the government once again to immediately suspend the use of all mrna treatment in both human and animal pende the outcome of that inquiry applause no no we will have to clear the gallery if clapping continue will order it if necessary as we have just witness feeling be very strong on this issue and large number of people have suffer directly or indirectly as result of have vaccine for most people the vast majority the vaccine be very good news and they make an enormous contribution to the public health of the country but that do not mean that we should turn blind eye to those for whom the vaccine be bad news in the early debate today reiterate my request that the government take effective action through the vaccine damage payment scheme to ensure that those people for whom the vaccine be bad news receive proper compensation as the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen remind we the maximum payment under that scheme be that figure have not be update in line with inflation since have it be update it would now be about why do the government not update it relatively small number of people be involve but it seem as though there be reluctance on the government part to face up to the reality that for small proportion of people the vaccine be bad news when we have this debate initially soon after the out of the vaccine the government be unequivocal in say that the vaccine be safe and effective and with no qualification at all subsequently astrazeneca issue essentially warning notice to practitioner which say that they should be cautious about the roll out of some of the vaccine to some patient people who wish to make claim against the vaccine manufacturer the government civil claim to supplement the that they have already be award be find it difficult to get access to lawyer to pursue their claim particularly if those claim arise from vaccine administer after astrazeneca issue its first warning against the safety of its vaccine in certain circumstance large number of people across the country look to the government to intervene first to ensure that the vaccine damage payment scheme be update and secondly to ensure that the people who apply under that scheme have their claim deal with in reasonable timeframe many of those claim be not there be more than claim and plus have not even be resolve yet the delay extend to month or more the consequence for many claimant be that they be unable to begin their civil action but civil action have to be bring within three year of the cause of action arise if it be not to be affect by the limitation period have ask the prime minister have meeting with he and have raise this at prime minister question whether the government will intervene to ensure that the three year limitation period do not apply to people still wait for determination of their claim under the vaccine damage payment scheme if they wish to go on and sue the government or the manufacturer it be matter of simple equity and justice have yet to have substantive answer from the government be due to meet the secretary of state for health and social care next week and hope that by then she will be able to assure she be lawyer as well as secretary of state that nobody will be deny justice as result of the government delay in administer the vaccine damage payment scheme very much share the disappointment of the hon member for north west leicestershire who introduce this debate that module of the public inquiry have be postpone last august there be preliminary hearing and there be some potent advocacy by the lawyer represent the victim group who want to give evidence in module that evidence will be extremely compelling when it be hear by the inquiry it be big disappointment to those group to and to other that module be postpone we have be tell that it have be postpone until january next year the reason for that seem rather weak and feeble but the inquiry be independent evidence that be to have be give in july will now not be hear until january next year the implication be serious for those seek compensation for their suffering but it be also significant for that other group of people that be because module deal not just with vaccine but with therapeutic there be big issue about therapeutic because evusheld the therapeutic that be mean to be available in particular for those who be suppress and not able to take the vaccine be never approve by nice second version of evusheld be be bring forward but that have also still not be approve my constituent bernard mathysse have write to in recent month to draw my attention to letter send on march to the prime minister by group of charity concern with the issue it call for the government to intervene and ensure that an early decision be make on what can be do to help immunocompromise people who can not access the vaccine in any event my constituent say that france have give emergency authorisation to evusheld and have get it into patient within month of authorisation he believe that other european country will do the same the united states have give pemgarda another drug emergency authorisation and so on why can we not get commitment from the government to ensure that evusheld be available to clinically vulnerable people my constituent also write to in july express the need to fast track an essential pre exposure prophylaxis drug the consequence for he be that he and his wife have be in effect shielding for about four year they meet friend only outside they do not travel on public transport or go by aeroplane they ask the family to test before visit they mask indoor and they have to assess every situation to gauge the risk involve that obviously mean that they have much restrict and isolated life to their detriment but that could be resolve if the evusheld issue be take seriously by the government if module have be hear this summer perhaps baroness hallett as an interim recommendation could have say the government must get on with that be hugely enjoy my hon friend speech too have constituent who be immunosuppressed and unbelievably still shielding which be put huge pressure on the family do not the slowness of the decision over this therapeutic stand in sorry contrast with the rapid decision take on vaccine in the first place exactly one of the inhibition there may have be on the government part be that to justify the use of emergency vaccine it be necessary for they to believe that there be no alternative of course if those alternative measure have be recognise as suitable way of provide some protection to individual against that would have undermine the vaccine manufacturer case that they need emergency authorisation for their vaccine without go through the normal testing procedure the continue slowness of the government in respond to request for licensing of evusheld reinforce the feeling out there among many people that something funny be go on here and that if we have come forward with those therapeutic measure at the beginning many life would have be save such an extensive vaccination programme would not have be need and the government would have save lot of money there be an issue there but that be why the part of the motion that regret the postponement of that element of the inquiry be important we can debate academically or in political circle the issue of the excess death but it be interesting that the government concede that there have be excess death the house of commons library briefing produce on april for this debate say the government have acknowledge an increase in the number of excess death in england and wales and have attribute these to combination of factor such as the prevalence of heart disease flu and heart disease the emphasis be on heart disease but many people feel that the increase in heart condition and disease have be exacerbate by the very vaccine that people be persuade to take to protect they against accord to an article last year dr thomas levy say that on his estimate vaccine be cause heart injury in at least of people who receive the covid injection he estimate that minimum of million americans now have heart damage by covid vaccine and although there no way of be certain at this time he say it within the realm of possibility that over million people in america have some degree of heart damage from the injection not myocarditis but heart damage that will be detectable with troponin test there may be link between the propensity of vaccine to damage people heart and what the house of commons library interpret the government figure concede be an issue of excess death attributable to heart disease the hon gentleman make good point that there be not single medical intervention that do not also have risk the medical profession will always acknowledge that but be it not about balance of the benefit against the risk ultimately the judgment be make by those who support the covid vaccine that the benefit far outweigh the risk impose by the vaccine agree that the benefit outweigh the risk but do not think we have ever have system in this country where we license drug on the basis that they will do more harm than good to those who take they if the drug be potentially significantly harmful to large number of patient those drug do not get their licence and why should they with respect that be exactly what we do antibiotic cause anaphylactic reaction that kill people we give antibiotic to people know that very small portion of they will be kill by they but overall they save many more life than they take that be why they get licence the key question be do the people who be be prescribe the antibiotic know that there be risk that they will die as result of they be prescribe if so they be tell that but nobody who be affect by the vaccine be tell that they be anything other than absolutely safe and effective that be the basis upon which lot of the litigation will be found agree with my hon friend hon member be suggest that the benefit of the vaccine outweigh the risk they suggest in these debate that there be always balance to be make and agree but do they acknowledge that there be risk attach to the vaccine and that the excess death that we be describe can be attribute to the vaccine they might suggest that the risk be outweigh by the enormous benefit of the vaccine by save life but if they be suggest that there be risk that could help explain the excess death that be not the government position their position be that there be no link between the vaccine and the excess death if they be suggest that there be link but it be outweigh by the benefit that be different argument rise order you can not intervene on an intervention call sir christopher chope madam deputy speaker the enthusiasm be unbounded will happily give way to the hon member for bath wera hobhouse if she wish to make the point to in an intervention that she would have like to have make to my hon friend the member for devizes danny kruger thank the hon gentleman for give way this be the point be it not there have to be absolute certain evidence that there be that link to the covid vaccine that still have to be prove in my belief will the hon gentleman give way order it be important that the hon gentleman answer the first intervention before take second thank you madam deputy speaker that be very wise advice take the hon lady point but the government be reluctant to concede at the beginning that there might be risk associate with all this now we have see that some people have be adversely affect and in certain circumstance have even lose love one we would expect the government to look after people who have be adversely affect which be the whole ethos of the vaccine damage payment scheme when it be set up the government be fall down on their responsibility on that and as result that be add to vaccine hesitancy the proportion of people who be accept invitation from the health service to have yet another booster be plummet because increasingly people realise that in their particular circumstance the risk may outweigh any possible benefit thank the hon gentleman for give way the chamber ask for link we know that the excess death be predominantly in cardiac arrest heart problem and stroke we know that the vaccine work supposedly by induce human cell to produce spike protein to be attack by our own immune system and create the immune response we know that the vaccine do not stay in the arm it travel all over the body through the blood supply blood vessel be line by endothelial cell the mrna go into they and make they create spike they be attack by the immune system that explode into the blood supply and that be blood clot if it go to the heart you have heart attack if it go to the brain or the lung you have stroke or pulmonary embolism that be the link interruption order this be the final warning it be simply not acceptable for there to be clap in the gallery when particular member speak if there be any repeat of it will ask for the gallery to be clear just want to be absolutely clear that that be the position will take because it be not what happen in the chamber or the gallery the hon gentleman have put on record what he want to say in that intervention all be say be that as the chairman of the all party parliamentary group on vaccine damage receive large number of letter not just from my constituent but from across the country from people who have be adversely affect do not think anybody be challenge the authenticity of their circumstance or the complaint they make be go to close know lot of other people want to participate in the debate with one such letter that come not from one of my constituent but somebody else she give her name but will not repeat it she say after receive my vaccination experience severe adverse reaction that result in hospitalisation these reaction encompass stroke like symptom include seizure tremor inability to work or talk irregular heart palpitation low oxygen level vertigo brain fog memory loss balance issue tingle high blood pressure and more despite undergo extensive examination recent diagnosis of functional neurological disorder have highlight my ongoing struggle with headache decline eyesight and daily seizure before vaccination be healthy year old however now be severely disabled unable to work and fill with uncertainty about my future especially with the imminent arrival of my baby unfortunately my situation be not unique thousand of individual be suffer similar consequence despite assurance of safety many have be leave with life alter disability or bad be write to urgently request an investigation into case like mine to address the impact of vaccine relate injury she go on to give the batch number and to quote the rather lame response from the mhra the hon gentleman have just illustrate very clearly the fundamental difference between some of the point that have be make about prophylaxis and anaphylaxis when people be give drug that could precipitate or trigger an anaphylactic reaction they be give prophylactic cover to prevent that the hon gentleman be talk about the consequence as describe by the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen of spike protein embed itself throughout the body prompt systemic inflammatory response that be not acute as with anaphylaxis but chronic that reaction to the vaccine be very different from normal allergic reaction that be anaphylactic and will be treat appropriately be most grateful to the hon gentleman for bring his scientific expertise to the debate because be no scientist be mere lawyer may try to add some further clarity there be actually range of side effect many of which occur over time ibuprofen for instance be another medicine that we might consider safe and call safe and large number of people take it but eventually after many year some will suffer stomach bleed that cause they to pass away as result of take too much ibuprofen over time although that be medically allow and consider to be safe be afraid that the attempt to give scientific explanation be base on flawed understanding of medicine and side effect which have be demonstrate by numerous people on the other side of the debate will not be able to adjudicate on whether my hon friend or the hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey be right but look forward to my hon friend be able to make his own speech and to its being subject to scrutiny by the hon gentleman that be spectacle to which think we be all look forward be listen carefully to what my hon friend be say and be sure we all feel very sorry for the young woman in the case that he have describe but be there not the potential that when vaccine be give in such great quantity to such large cohort of the population there be more likely to be correlation than causation between the effect there be no doubt that people be ill before covid and before the vaccination be deliver but my problem be that do not know the answer to that question interruption the hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey say he do but be not sure how he can what will say be this should not all of we be call for further research on this issue to find out what the fundamental truth of it be rather than listen to those who make assertion that have not be approve by scientist part of the answer to my hon friend question be to be find in the adjudication of the independent medical adviser who have be look at claim make under the vaccine damage payment scheme they have conclude that in several hundred case there be no doubt that the adverse consequence that be the subject of complaint be cause by the vaccine and that have give rise to the compensation in large number of other case the medic have conclude that the condition suffer and complain about be cause by the vaccine but have not cause sufficient disability beyond the threshold to trigger payment give the evidence provide by the doctor who be act independently on behalf of the vaccine damage compensation scheme there be now no doubt that for some people the vaccine be fatal or cause severe damage or injury that be not in dispute and the more people understand that the more they will realise that it be over the top for the government and ministers to pretend at the beginning of the vaccination programme that these vaccine be go to be different from almost all other know medical intervention and vaccine in other word they be not absolutely safe and effective the failure to say that have severely undermine trust in the system which be why we need lot more debate like this rise order before call the next speaker want to be absolutely clear for the benefit of everybody who be watch our proceeding or participate in they that if there be any more interruption from the gallery and it have to be clear will have to temporarily suspend the house which may mean that those who want to participate will be deny the opportunity to be clear be try to create situation whereby everybody can have their say it be pleasure to follow the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope who have do remarkably good work on vaccine damage people co chair his all party parliamentary group sister group the appg on pandemic response and recovery which have allow to see that we have whole body of expert opinion before we medic lawyer expert in childcare and whole range of politician have come to very different view on what the right response to covid be and in some case on both the law and the science itself before go any far let say that my experience of the appg and of climate change or global warming debate be that science and politic make very uneasy bedfellow there be often an attempt in political debate to resolve matter that be only resolvable by look at the evidence do more experiment and find out the truth of the matter which be not always possible in debate where people feel very strongly about thing want to talk about something we have not really talk about so far the disease itself people have different view about the damage do by covid some people think it be harmless and just another flu whereas some treat it as though it be the plague it be neither it be nasty disease for some people who get it but its major characteristic be the profile of people who be kill or make ill by it it affect old people much more severely think the median age of those who die be for man and for woman so it be disease of the elderly those below be relatively safe some die but not many that be know at the beginning of the epidemic this come back to the point about politic and the protection of government politician be more important than look at the science rational response to disease with the profile of would have be to put cordon sanitaire around those people who be vulnerable because of their age or because they have other disease such as lung disease and to let the rest of we go about our business and take the risk as we do every year with seasonal flu but the government do the opposite they lock everybody up and send untested people back from hospital into care home where they infect other people which lead to spike in death at the same time the government be tell we that they be follow the science have scientific background it be not in biology but have degree in chemistry and believe in follow the science and find out exactly what be go on the science be not follow and not only because the response do not follow the natural profile of the disease in their early statement people from the nhs and both chris whitty and patrick vallance say that mask be complete waste of time and that lockdown be ineffective because there would be peak six month later that would probably be bad than if we have not lock down that advice change very quickly believe under political pressure again think that be mistake one country that do follow the science sweden make mistake it make the same mistake that we make by send infected people back into care home but it do not lock down and it do not restrict people freedom or it do so in only moderate way it come out as about the good of comparable country in europe in term of death another consequence which we see in every debate in this house be that there be no money leave we spend billion on covid lot of it waste we can read national audit office report on the test and trace system which be money almost totally waste there be also the money give to people who could quite easily have go about their job the business need the money give the decision that the government have take but the government should not have take those decision will the hon gentleman accept that some of his comment be more relevant in hindsight than they might have be at the time in march it be difficult to predict the path of the disease we have see picture from around the world of hospital department overwhelm by those turn up with respiratory problem and government not only here but around the world have to respond to that in hindsight of course what the hon gentleman be say be accurate but at the time we have to react in the way that we feel would protect the high number of people and protect department from be overwhelmed that require we to act quickly perhaps mistake be make but they be mistake in hindsight agree with the hon gentleman to point in march when the first decision be make nobody know what be go to happen there be panic to go into lockdown which be understandable while people be see what be go on but very soon after that people do know what think be and be indefensible be to carry on with policy that we know be damage the economy and be not protect people therefore vote against my own party which support the government and more on this issue go through the lobby with small number of colleague from my party and the hon gentleman party to say that what be happen be wrong and that the damage be do by the policy be probably bad than covid it might be hindsight for march and april but not for the rest of the time and the second lockdown once we know the profile of the disease we know that we be damage child go into school and meet eight and nine year old who be lock down when it be know that child be not at risk very small number of child die and as far as know they all have comorbiditie stand to be correct so covid be essentially safe for child we have damage both their mental health and their ability to learn go into school from time to time as be sure the hon gentleman do and teacher tell that it be very difficult to catch up be still annoyed about the response and do not think it be hindsight go through the lobby with minority of colleague one of the two failure of our democracy normal check and balance be that this place be not function as the easter holiday be extend surely the most important thing in crisis be for our democratic institution to function properly we could not ask proper question and there be no follow up we keep our select committee go but with the good will in the world it be pale imitation of what have go before there be complete failure to insist on more accountability from the government while the economy be shut down some of we although we be not very many come here to try to keep it go our democracy second important check and balance be the fourth estate these publication be not normally my politic but with the exception of the daily telegraph and the spectator and the daily mail to certain extent the rest of the medium lead by the bbc be quite uncritical of what be happen people say that bbc reporter be tell not to criticise and not to ask difficult question and political journalist not specialist health journalist who might have ask more pertinent question be send to the press conference it be political question but it be also science and health question we be really let down by the bbc primarily and by other part of the medium the hon member for christchurch and other hon member have talk about the hallett inquiry support the inquiry but have see the way it have go have give myself good talk to do not think will ever again support an inquiry do we really want to spend half billion pound on this inquiry attend the previous debate on recompense and we hear how lawyer be get fat on all these inquiry do not know when the hallett inquiry will report but it may well last for year and cost half billion pound it certainly will not provide we with any advice on what to do if there be pandemic next year suspect that advice be what we all want by the time it report there may have be another government or two and it will be historical document sweden be not perfect society but its inquiry have report the motion before we call for the fourth part of the inquiry which will be on vaccine but be the inquiry really the technical body to do that do not think so in the first stage the inquiry have show an extraordinary bias towards believe in lockdown would want to know number of thing from an inquiry do the lockdown work do they save life have they cost life where do the virus come from the inquiry be not even look at that and it be not deal with any of those thing but it be take long time it have make it abundantly clear that it be go to look at the impact of the virus on social division and poverty be member of the labour party and can tell the inquiry because know that poor people come off bad from disease it can go back to look at the black report from believe it be if it want to see that as it talk about both regional and class disparity we do not need to look at this issue as we know that poor people do badly when there be epidemic that have be true for all time the hon gentleman be make an eloquent point give our experience of inquiry be it the current covid inquiry or the ongoing post office horizon inquiry be it any surprise that even the sub postmaster have come to the conclusion that there be no justice in these inquiry and they be now consider bring private criminal prosecution to get their own justice no be not surprised about that inquiry take long time and their report and recommendation often gather dust have never make this point before and hope be not go off piste too much madam deputy speaker but every time there be an horrific murder of child we get report with odd recommendation and the question be do that protect the next child no it do not do not believe that these inquiry do we need serious cultural change in many of these organisation rather than another report on something that be an easy thing to say and very difficult thing to achieve let come on to the other part of the debate which be about excess death and the number of death it appear that just over people be kill in this country by or die of covid have my doubt about these figure from the beginning on number of occasion right from the start of covid the science and technology committee hear from statistician we have sir ian diamond and professor spiegelhalter in to talk to we about the statistic we hear from people from what be now the uk health security agency but be then name part of the nhs we ask they whether they have the statistic on the difference between people who die from covid and those who die with it if someone be die of cancer and go into hospital there be fair chance that they would have get covid because there be not perfect protection within hospital such person would then be register as have be covid death but clearly they be go to die of cancer from the very beginning that obscure the statistic number of statistic be use to profile the cause of death during the pandemic but ultimately the most reliable statistic come from the death certificate where clinician have to make judgment about whether something be cause or an association those figure be reliable and they match and mirror the other figure so we have to be careful about disparage the statistic that be use to monitor the profile of the pandemic over time in the rapid way we need and the more authoritative and credible figure that do demonstrate quite close match and help in genuinely understanding who do and do not die from covid the hon gentleman make fair point but happen to know that in some local authority instruction go out to the people who be register death essentially to say if there be cough involve in this we want it down as covid there be different process because the health service be not work under if the hon gentleman want to correct be happy to allow he to do so to come to that conclusion one have to say that individual clinician join in conspiracy to lie about what be on death certificate we can cast these aspersion but someone have to fill that certificate in and do not accept that individual doctor deliberately mislead with what be on someone death certificate that be what the hon gentleman be suggest be not suggest that at all be suggest that at that time when it be difficult to examine people because there be distance between clinician and the people who have suffer death there be temptation and view that covid should go on the death certificate suggest no conspiracy though do not believe in conspiracy the hon gentleman will be aware that the astrazeneca vaccine be withdraw eventually in the uk and around the world it be withdraw because of the rare of blood clot on the brain it be not put down on any death certificate in the uk by doctor until after the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency admit due to international pressure that there be that risk after that the death certificate start to appear with vaccine relate harm put it to the hon gentleman that that be because doctor be intimidate by the idea that their reputation would be smear for put anything down as vaccine harm or by have the gmc on their back the hon gentleman have make his point do not believe in conspiracy do believe that from time to time one get view both in profession and outside profession that push judgment in one particular direction believe there be one point on which we can reach consensus in the debate government ministers say that the vaccine be safe it be particularly egregious when that be say about child but no vaccine or treatment as right hon and hon member have say be safe think it be mistake to say those thing the hon gentleman have make sensible serious point minister here and in other country know that when they set up the global vaccine study for those who want to know about this afterwards not during the debate bmj article reference look at some rare side effect and acknowledge some of the other side effect but those who start say we should not have have the vaccine be wrong and those who think that anyone believe any treatment be completely safe be wrong as well be not familiar with that particular paper but agree with the hon gentleman that nothing be ever safe and vaccine have an overall benefit be vaccinate against covid as have be vaccinate against many thing over my lifetime vaccine have make the health of this country and country around the world that can afford vaccine much well over many year far to that may suggest that this should not be binary we do not acknowledge that some people have clearly have severely negative side effect from the covid vaccine that should be acknowledge and there should be compensation and support without completely throw out the whole vaccine programme of course want to move on to excess death over the last couple of year since covid and the figure during covid one of the way of measure the impact of covid be look at excess death during covid they be measure against five year average that be the gold standard it be the way it have be do and that give quite large figure that be interesting give what have happen when the excess death per year over the past two year have be look at the office for national statistics have move away from that basis and on to different one and the figure be come down we need an anonymise account of those excess death this be part of recent westminster hall debate because that will help we to understand what be go on the pharmaceutical company have be give that information but ministers just give reassuring statement that there be no evidence that excess death be cause by the covid vaccination by the mrna vaccination how do they know they do not tell we that we need to know first how they have come to that conclusion and secondly if that be fair reasoned and balanced conclusion we also need detailed look at the anonymised statistic so that we can ask further question about the problem that be worry we that certainly worry and so that we can make well decision in future may start by pay tribute to all the member who have speak in the debate have great respect for they all it be particular privilege to follow the hon member for blackley and broughton graham stringer he be hero during the covid period while so many of we be blindly follow what the government tell we to do he stand almost alone in make up his own mind also acknowledge the leadership of my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope and the work that he be do to support the many many family and people who have suffer adverse reaction and be proud to support he in that work have great affection and respect for my hon friend the member for crewe and nantwich dr mullan who be do valiant job stick up for his perspective in this debate he be sit directly behind the minister so be not sure whether he be able to speak none the less respect the position that he have take also wish to acknowledge the work do and the speech make by the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen please do not start cheer because mr deputy speaker will close down the debate he be not popular with member on the conservative benches but think that we have an obligation to take what he say seriously and to examine the evidence that he have bring to the house he have an absolute right to make the case that he do in this place finally before get on to the point in my speech let mention my hon friend the member for south basildon and east thurrock stephen metcalfe he make the essential point that we need more evidence fundamentally we need the government to be more open and to instruct the agency of the government the regulator and the health service to provide the datum that we need to get to the bottom of this issue implore the minister to respond to that point in her wind up disagree with the suggestion from the hon member for north west leicestershire that some fishy business be go on in how the ons have be calculate excess death in recent year who know perhaps there be some fishy business go on but the ons take the right decision to change the methodology as carl heneghan and other have point out the previous method of account for excess death of take an average over five year actually lead to an exaggeration of excess death number during the pandemic and in sense contribute to the great anxiety that many people feel which encourage the lockdown so it be right to rethink how excess death be calculate we know by all the different measure that many more people be die now than be before the pandemic that might be account for simply by an age population by long covid or by the effect of an nhs under pressure but as we have hear today there be significant evidence that other factor be at play in particular the impact on people heart and increasingly young people heart deserve attention the british heart foundation report last june that since the start of the pandemic more people have die than would have be expect that be surely significant cause for we to take this question seriously the question raise by the hon member for north west leicestershire be whether the vaccine have contribute to this increase in excess death hesitate to wade into this debate because be not scientist recognise the point make by other particularly the hon member for blackley and broughton that science and politic be uncomfortable bedfellow we know that there be adverse effect from the vaccination everybody acknowledge that it be question of the extent to which those effect have be manifest my particular concern this go back to my point about request for evidence be whether the system that oversee the licensing regulation monitoring and analysis of medical treatment in general and vaccine in particular be up to scratch there be so much speculation in the debate about what be go on and what be true and what be not but we seem to have some fact that we can all agree on the first be afraid be that the mhra be significantly deficient in the way it operate the cumberlege report this be reference in the early debate raise concern about the way treatment be regulate and license that have not yet be address be afraid that through the covid episode many of the same concern be manifest in relation to the vaccine we now know that the mhra know about the effect of the astrazeneca vaccine on blood clotting as early as february but issue warning about that only some month later in april month after other country have suspend the az vaccine the mhra also know about the prevalence of heart problem and myocarditis in february but do nothing about it until june that year in the intervene time million of people be vaccinate without the knowledge that the mhra have as have be say we find out recently that pfizer misrepresent the safety and efficacy of the vaccine there have be very little comeback against it for that and no meaningful fine as we hear just few thousand pound be charge in expense the regulatory system that oversee the pharmaceutical company be surely deeply conflicted not least due to be partly fund by the pharmaceutical company that it be set up to represent it be significant and of concern that they have make so much money out of the vaccine and so far do not appear to be make due recompense for some of the acknowledge harm be not talk about the wilder claim that their vaccine have be responsible for will the minister enlighten we on whether the indemnity against civil and government action that the government award to the vaccine manufacturer at the beginning of the production process still apply if it transpire that the company mislead the government and the public about the safety and efficacy of their product the inquiry have be mention there be so many unanswered question and apparent red flag that it surprise that the medium and parliament be not more up in arm about excess death be surprised that more attention be not be pay to this question the fact be that this scandal if it be scandal suit no one in high place in our country it be true that we have an inquiry but as the hon member for blackley and broughton say surely it be ask the wrong question it be very concern that the module look at the vaccination programme have be postpone it strike that the inquiry be essentially ask the wrong question it be really just ask why we do not do more lockdown quick that seem to be its prevail question for the expert not whether the whole response be the right one and crucially in the light of what we now know whether the final response of mass vaccination programme be as safe and effective as be claim we be rightly proud in this country of the effectiveness speed and operation of the vaccine production and roll out it be triumph of effective collaboration between government and the private sector the operation of the roll out be victory that all people can acknowledge but it be not enough to say that the roll out be do well be it do safely do it need to be do on the scale on which it be do particularly do young people need to be vaccinate at all we all remember kate bingham and other say early on that the vaccine be only for the old population these question be increasingly be ask by the public and raise in the medium let conclude quickly with what have be do hope that we will get more answer from the minister than have have so far from the government on april year ago yesterday write privately to the secretary of state ask he for evidence that justify the government assertion that there be no link between the vaccine and the excess death do that because have so much correspondence from people raise that concern say be write privately in this way rather than raise the question in parliament because be determined not to give credence to unscientific conspiratorial accusation nor to undermine the vaccination programme in public if it be indeed entirely safe and effective do not want to do this in public want to give the government the opportunity to give the evidence so that could pass it back to constituent but be afraid that the reply receive from minister be the one that we have already hear the bland assertion that combination of factor flu old age and so on probably account for the excess death the rest of the letter be all about what the government be do to combat excess death and the answer be mostly more vaccine do not think that be good enough year roll by the evidence seem to mount and more and more people be raise this concern so join the hon member for north west leicestershire the hon member for blackley and broughton graham stringer my hon friend the member for shipley sir philip davies who could not be here today he want to explain that he be on important constituency business but be very much here in spirit and other in write this time public letter to the government ask the same question in more detail we ask specifically what be the evidence for the definitive statement about safety and efficacy the government say there be no evidence link excess death to the vaccine if so that be great news but may we have the evidence on which that assertion be base secondly we ask will the department for health the mhra and the uksha release the datum that be need to understand what be go on the datum that we be ask for be already make available privately to pharmaceutical company for they to use in their safety study of the vaccine why do they get it but not the public why can not independent scientist look at that datum be sorry to say that we have reply neither to that letter which be write in february here we be in april nor after month to the freedom of information request that go to the agency do not know why the government would not want to release the datum it may be that the datum could be misuse and misrepresent one way around that might be to invite research application from our very sophisticated research ecosystem researcher could be give access to the datum if they come forward with particular research project they would then be able to report on it with external verification that they have actually use the datum supply and not drift too far from it that sort of practical suggestion should be consider would be interested in hear the government response to that we be ask for anonymise datum that pose no risk to any individual if the data be open and public and the whole purpose be scientific interrogation and analysis it should not be possible to misuse it we need as much sunlight on that datum as possible let end by repeat the commitment that hope we will get from the minister have be ask for anonymised record level official mortality datum include vaccination status that information which be already be share with drug company should be share with parliament and the public if that be not possible could the minister explain why secondly what be the source for the definitive statement that the government have make most recently in october and that dare say they might make again today about there be no evidence of link between the excess death figure and the vaccine hope that there be no link take the vaccine at least the first two jab as do most of my family and my constituent be sure that most people in the public gallery take it we all do hope that the hon member for north west leicestershire be wrong to assert that there be dangerous connection be reluctant to be brand conspiracy theorist and still do not want to give credence to unscientific assertion but we in this place be here to take risk the risk of ridicule and contempt in exchange for the privilege of be here and think it be right that we raise these concern on behalf of the public even when there be some political cost too many people be die and we must understand why will begin by pick up on few of the point that have be raise this afternoon first there be parallel with very important report that we receive last week and to which the government respond on monday the cass review when concern be first raise about what be happen in gender identity development service those of we who speak up at that time suffer both political and public pile on that be very uncomfortable it give no pleasure to have be vindicate by the content of the cass review certainly when the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen first raise his concern on this issue he be also subject to political and public pile on the reason raise that be that this can not be how we tackle thorny issue we must have much more reasoned and mature approach to these thing where ideological position be not sacrosanct and we have the flexibility to engage with and look at the point that be be raise my second point be about the discussion regard correlation versus causation it be fair enough to say that correlation do not necessarily mean causation but it be sufficient evidence for we to start ask question about what be actually there that be fundamental question that anybody who have be involve in any scientific endeavour must surely understand my next point be slightly more difficult issue to raise because it be quite emotive like many other in this chamber have have two vaccine and booster my family have the same but there be question about the presumption that that be what save life we can not prove that unfortunately that be just not the way it work but what we do have to grapple with be the fact that the treatment we be give like any agent can cause harm we have responsibility to interrogate those concern which be why be very disappointed that module of the inquiry have be delay my last point be about the record level datum and the importance of how it be tabulate the methodology for assess excess death have change that might be reasonable change in practice at time of peace if you like but we have just come through very difficult period with the pandemic change the methodology immediately afterwards seem perverse at well and deeply concern at bad because it be important that from this moment on we be able to understand how trend be change in directly comparable way with change in methodology that become impossible so it be not good idea just in term of scientific rigour it be problematic will start off my contribution by expand on some of the comment make during the debate on january because we have very limited time to speak in that debate want to take we step back away from the emotive issue of whether there be correlation causation and relationship between excess death and the covid vaccine and remind ourselves of the principle that underpin how clinical trial should be conduct the ethical principle that underpin those trial have their origin in the declaration of helsinki and be consistent with internationally publish good clinical practice guideline and obviously all of the regulatory mechanism that fall out from those guideline anybody who have be involve in clinical trial of any type will know that as have say any agent have the potential to cause injury or harm that be just the nature of the beast and one of the thing we try to establish during clinical trial be to find out the harm however minimal or maximal it may be so as to mitigate it manage it or rule the agent out because it be too risky perform such test rigorously be the foundation of good clinical practice and make these comment as someone who have be involve in the management and delivery of clinical trial over many year think that as politician as clinician and as the industry we all carry duty of honesty and candour in these matter with the hon gentleman experience and he have look at the pfizer trial document be it not clear that pfizer only trialle the experimental vaccine for eight week with vaccination group and placebo group and then it vaccinate the placebo group so how can anyone tell anybody what the long term effect of these vaccine be when people be only ever monitor for eight week after vaccination thank the hon gentleman who make really important point the answer to that be that it be impossible and that be the fundamental point we can not measure late effect if we do not have evidence of late effect would the hon gentleman inform the house in what be normally do what percentage of medicine be normally subject to longitudinal study before they be put on the market be sorry but do not quite catch the hon gentleman question can the hon gentleman tell the house what percentage of medicine that normally go to market be subject to longitudinal study which be what he be talk about before that be do that be not actually the point be make be make the point that any clinical trial whether something be rule in or rule out be subject to gcp guideline and it be up to the medical research ethic committee to sign off the protocol indicate dissent well the hon gentleman can shake his head but that be my experience work at university college london hospitals and the royal marsden and those be the principle that we apply in such context can only speak to my experience be not member of the abpi so can not give he those type of datum be talk about gcp as general principle if he do not believe in gcp as general principle that be different discussion be no apologist for big pharma company but do the hon member not acknowledge that there be time pressure in produce vaccine to mitigate all the thing we have hear about lockdown our economy be stall and all the rest of it do he not acknowledge that there be time pressure thank the hon lady for her question think we all understand the situation that we be in be not use retrospectoscope to say that thing should not have be do in the way they be do however they should have be conduct absolutely in accordance with gcp guideline and that be the fundamental crux of the matter be not suggest for moment that that be not the spirit in which the various company enter into this but we be talk about will the hon gentleman give way will the hon gentleman let finish the point be make be sorry but have now forget the point be go to make to the hon lady do not think anybody enter into this to do the wrong thing but there be fundamental question about how we move thing forward now and whether harm be inflict as part of the administration of these agent will the hon gentleman give way will give way one more time be very grateful raise this because the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen make point about timeline say that the trial be do in eight week and ask how the vaccine could possibly be safe the reason why mention longitudinal study be that common deliberate attempt to mislead people about what go on with the vaccine be to suggest that because the trial be do over short period of time it could not possibly have be do correctly typically trial take long time because it take long time to recruit the right number of patient and to do the work in such trial the same number of patient go through it over long period but that do not change the baseline datum which be base on how many patient there be we do not typically use longitudinal study and that vaccine trial be do by use lot of people in short space of time to create the same amount of evidence thank the hon gentleman for that clarify point people have speak to who be involve in those clinical trial have raise serious and significant concern about the way that their experience after the drug be administer to they and the impact that it have on they in an acute way be either minimise or write out of trial datum that be serious allegation and everyone should be interested in understand the detail it be certainly not what would understand would fit within the principle of gcp and there be serious question about how trial study be conduct as the hon member for north west leicestershire say the longitudinal element of that be impossible we be now see that but that do not mean we can ignore it absolutely not the principle have be outline be there because they be the basis on which good science be establish and base let move to some of the question that we must raise and answer today openly and transparently and with full access to ons record level datum be not say that that should be disclose to all and sundry but surely the government can not defend the position that they be not willing to release that information to interested clinician and clinical academic as minimum those be the people who need to interrogate the datum it be of little relevance to do not have the mean or academic ability to interpret it but it be something that interested clinical academic should have access to let move on to what we know about some of the issue surround mrna technology we know that it do not replicate locally as we be assure it would do on launch it metastasise to distant tissue and replicate spike protein systemically distant from the site of administration that be problematic for number of reason accord to the university of london professor of oncology and principal of the institute for cancer vaccines and immunotherapy professor angus dalgleish this have precipitate various serious and sometimes fatal consequence due to antibody development mediate by the spike protein will not go into the detail of that but at meeting convene by the hon member for north west leicestershire professor dalgleish tell we that the uk government and their agency be in serious denial about this issue result in many death be poorly understand let give couple of example vaccine induce immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia be one of the principal cause of blood clot formation which can cause stroke pulmonary emboli and other cardiac relate event include heart attack all of which can be life limiting or fatal another antibody link to the spike protein exert an effect on myelin and be associate with guillain barré syndrome and transverse myelitis which be swelling around the spinal cord professor dalgleish believe that that constitute medical negligence because the fact be there for all to see he contend that many death be as direct result of unnecessary vaccination furthermore he advise that there be great number of yellow card in mhra for covid vaccine than for all other vaccine record and nothing have really be do in recent write answer to it be confirm that the mhra have receive spontaneous suspect adverse drug reaction report relate to the vaccine up to and include february this year across the united kingdom of those report be associate with fatal outcome of course the true number be unknown that be the nature of yellow card reporting as only fraction of adverse event be report and that be probably because of limited public awareness about some of the potential consequence and complication of vaccine and the well understand under reporting of those adverse event that be important because the yellow card system be key element of safe and effective clinical care if thing be not be evaluate properly can think of no great betrayal of the mhra clinical governance responsibility suggest that accountability for that must be swift and decisive the rigorous assessment of these datum be essential and must be action urgently will the minister now engage with the mhra and invite it to come to the house to explain the fact on these report another issue which arise from far write question that table relate to the role of the mhra it have crucial role in fact it be statutory function to provide post market surveillance and to operate the yellow card system but the minister respond to my question about the assessment of the potential implication of the bmj article pfizer biontech vaccine be likely responsible for death of some elderly patient norwegian review find by state the mhra communicate safety advice base upon consideration of the totality of evidence from all relevant information source rather than the strength and limitation of individual datum source surely fundamental step in any meta analysis of publish datum be to interrogate the robustness of those datum and for the public to have confidence that that be happen that point link right back to where start on the cass report one of the fundamental failing that the report identify be circular citation among various different organisation they be validate one another position to create false impression that there be an evidence base for the practice they be involve in if the mhra will say we do not interrogate the datum when we do meta analysis who do who will validate the datum if can hand over to the mhra whole load of number and it will just count they and accept that have say my methodological rigour be robust that be not good enough as far as be concern the minister response to my write question be that the mhra do not assign causality at the level of individual report as that be not its responsibility if that be the case whose responsibility be it who be interrogate the datum and make that decision if no one be how can we get from correlation to developed picture of causation that be an essential step it raise fundamental question about that responsibility and the reliability of the datum that the mhra be rely on if we be to learn anything from the general implication of the cass report we must have clear steer from the mhra on how these fundamental scientific principle will be observe and uphold will canter through some important publish evidence which come back to the correlation causation discussion in study look at cardiac inflammatory marker in patient receive mrna vaccine steven gundry observe that mrna vaccination numerically increase marker previously describe by other for denote inflammation on the endothelium and cell infiltration of cardiac muscle in patient population receive the vaccine study by fraiman et al note that the excess risk of serious adverse event identify in their study point to the need for formal harm benefit analysis that suggestion be wholly consistent with the principle set out in the declaration of helsinki and be an ethical imperative in pre print lancet study by nicolas hulscher et al include lead cardiologist peter mccullough and yale epidemiologist harvey risch review autopsy after covid vaccination and find that of the death be attributable to the vaccine that study which be publish online be then swiftly remove allegedly for issue with ideological rigour wonder whether it be the mhra that do the assessment of its rigour surely those datum and finding however problematic some of the methodology might have be demand further scrutiny not removal december lancet regional health study by jonathan pearson stuttard et al examine excess mortality in england post the pandemic and the implication for secondary prevention it state many country include the uk have continue to experience an apparent excess of death long after the peak associate with the pandemic in and number of excess death estimate in this period be considerable it note that overall trend tend to be consistent across the various method it continue the cause of these excess death be likely to be multiple further analysis by cause and by and sex group may help quantify the relative contribution of these cause ask again should we not at least be curious about this the study continue the great number of excess death in the acute phase of the pandemic be in old adult the pattern now be one of persist excess death which be most prominent in relative term in middle aged and young adult with death from cvd cause and death in private home be most affected that be completely different clinical picture it continue timely and granular analysis be need to describe such trend and so to inform prevention and disease management effort document recently disclose as part of freedom of information lawsuit against the us food and drug administration indicate that the agency be aware that the safety monitoring system for pfizer vaccine be not sufficient for assess associate heart condition when it license the company vaccine those document also reveal numerous manufacturing concern with pfizer batch that be release to the public and show that the fda know about phenomenon know as vaccine associate enhanced disease in those who be vaccinate and experience breakthrough let we move on to what we do not know we have have no real progress on the point raise in the debate particularly on record level datum we need either that datum to be release to clinical academic and other or cogent explanation for why that be not happen why be those concern keep hide by the fda be similar concern or issue be hide by the uk government some of the point make about the delay in the mhra take action on clinical impact be relevant to that point accord to house of commons library briefing the government operate vaccine damage payment scheme which have be discuss in both this debate and the previous one provide only one off tax free payment which be currently modest to applicant where vaccine have cause severe disablement datum on vdps claim relate to vaccination be not routinely publish so we do not have particular metric that establish how many claim be be make against those vaccine the most recent datum be from september accord to the nhs business services authority at that time it have receive claim relate to follow medical assessment claim just under award and be reject further claim be find to be invalid we need to understand why that be what be claim be measure against and who be interpret the clinical assessment information we must also ask whether the exclusion criterion be reliable give the concern raise in the debate base on the datum that have here there be currently unresolved claim of which have be unresolved for more than six month if the successful claim receive the full payment the total cost will be around million if there be further successful claim from the unresolved case the associate cost will be furth million be advise that the government set aside some funding for this issue but this have the hallmark of the contaminated blood scandal write all over it we must get ahead of the game and make sure that people get the compensation that they desperately need at time when it be important to they there be another question why be the government so willing to pick up the tab on vaccine injury however inadequate the scheme be give the fatality and the significant life limit impact on the victim these concern have be amplify significantly follow the publication in the spectator australia of an account by genomics scientist kevin mckernan of his accidental discovery it state while run an experiment in his boston lab mckernan use some vial of mrna pfizer and moderna covid vaccine as control he be shocked to find that they be allegedly contaminate with tiny fragment of plasmid dna his concern have be consider far by professor angus dalgleish who note that the contaminant simian virus be sequence that be use to drive dna into the nucleus especially in gene therapy and that this be something that regulatory agency around the world have specifically say be not possible with the mrna vaccine these promotor be also well recognise as be oncogenic or cancer induce genetic material other scientist have confirm those finding professor dalgleish further note to put it bluntly this mean that they be not vaccine at all but genetically modify organism that should have be subject to totally different regulatory condition and certainly not be class as vaccine worryingly professor dalgleish also note that oncologist have contact he from across the world and the consensus be that this be think to be precipitate relapse in melanoma lymphoma leukaemia and kidney cancer he conclude with the following warning to advise booster vaccine as be the current case be no more and no less than medical incompetence to continue to do so with his cited evidence be medical negligence which can carry custodial sentence thank the hon gentleman for his contribution and his quote from professor angus dalgleish who remind the house be the most cited oncologist in the uk invite he here to witness this debate since he have some input into it he could not attend because he be speak at conference in berlin on this very issue thank the hon gentleman for that point of information and for acknowledge an important scientist in this debate it be great honour to have work in the same institution as professor dalgleish as he provide great leadership on this technology he make valuable and impeccable contribution to this problem he conclude that piece by say no if or but any long all mrna vaccine must be halt and ban now will the minister answer the following question be big pharma be exempt from liability and if so why the loss of trust in big pharma be substantial and worryingly because of that the value of vaccination itself have be deeply damage personally say this frankly will never accept another mrna vaccine and be far from alone will the minster agree to full disclosure of the datum and an investigation of the fact will she also commit to instruct the office for national statistics to release the record level datum or will it take someone like new zealander barry young whistleblower imprison for publish its record level datum to surface concern about the covid vaccine programme as we have see with the horizon scandal the government must never bury the fact when life be be lose and future destroy there be no great betrayal in closing the foundation of good clinical practice be under threat will put that in context with the december pathology research and practice paper on gene base vaccine from rhodes and parry they give the follow warning pandemic management require societal coordination global orchestration respect for human right and defence of ethical principle yet some approach to the pandemic drive by socioeconomic corporate and political interest have undermine key pillar of ethical medical science none of these clinical expert be quack or conspiracy theorist as the government say so often during the pandemic we must follow the science congratulate the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen on secure the debate and the backbench business committee on grant time for it thank member who have contribute include my hon friend the member for blackley and broughton graham stringer and the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope for devizes danny kruger and for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey it would be remiss of not to thank those who participate with extensive intervention include the hon member for south basildon and east thurrock stephen metcalfe the father of the house the hon member for worthe west sir peter bottomley who be no long in his place the hon member for crewe and nantwich dr mullan and the hon member for bath wera hobhouse we have have good and think fairly measure debate give the strong feeling hold on both side of it it be probably important to accurately define the subject we be discuss here today the term excess death be not new nor in any way derive directly from the pandemic it be key statistic continuously track by government of all colour and political persuasion over number of year it be datum that help ministers to keep inform and to inform policy development and measure to improve health outcome in our community vaccine in the pandemic be and importantly remain an essential tool in our fight against will the shadow minister give way on that point will not give way be just open disagree with the hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath in this respect think it be evident from the covid death datum during the pandemic throughout the lockdown that covid relate death come down significantly almost immediately as the vaccine be roll out what we can say as the hon member for christchurch do in his contribution be that for many million of people in this country the vaccine be success and it allow we to return to life that be as near normal as possible however we must not underestimate the fact that be massive killer in this country we only have to look at the wall across the river from the palace of westminster to see the impact have on community up and down the country and the opposition remain firmly of the view that the vaccine play massive fundamental role in return life to normal as happen with any form of medical intervention there have be instance of harmful side effect no one dispute that and when those be find they should of course be properly investigate the efficacy of drug need to be review over period of time and the science need to be fully understand and respond to that think be true of any drug that be available on the national health service should also say that the hon member for christchurch raise some very fair point about the covid vaccine damage payment scheme we have have debate about it in westminster hall and think he be right to raise those concern as eloquently as he do will always be open to the testing of scientific evidence but as number of member have point out today for million of we the vaccine have be game changer in overcome the bad fear of they have allow we to return to normality and most important of all they have save life we do need to understand more about why for some they have cause reaction and in some case may have tragically lead to fatality which be why think the hon member for south basildon and east thurrock be right to say that we need to get to the bottom of that datum but investigation and review should not be allow to frighten people who to this day be still deeply vulnerable away from take the covid vaccine booster and it be important for we to send out the message that those who need the booster should have they should put it on record that be fully vaccinate that be supporter of the vaccine when they first come out and that be supporter of they now and will continue to be think that they play huge role in manage serious disease my concern at the moment be that the tone of some of this debate be undermine not only the reputation of our scientist but the efficacy of vaccine programme in the future do not want to shut down the debate about the topic we need to find way of fill the evidence gap and hope we can do that collectively by encourage research so that potentially wild and untested theory do not fill that vacuum could not agree more with the hon gentleman we know that there be cohort of people for whom the vaccine have lead to reaction and we know that there be tragically cohort of people who have die we need to learn more about the impact of this set of vaccine on that cohort but for the vast majority of people the vaccine have be huge success and we should not let people think that they be at risk from they in fact many people who be be ask right now to take the vaccine because they be immunosuppressed be at risk of not take they and we need to ensure that they be protect too be fully vaccinate and because of my own ongoing health issue have just be invite for my next booster which will be take we know that the virus itself have be key driver of excess mortality and it continue to have an impact across our community to this day understand that and understand that covid affect many people still struggle with long covid in fact my long covid have be much bad than the actual covid infection that get in march way before any vaccine be even dream of there be lot of people who be in far bad situation because they have not yet be able to return to work or to near full fitness even to this day still struggle with the impact of covid infection right at the start of the first wave of covid in march and it debilitate for the good part of two year million of clinically vulnerable people the hon member for christchurch rightly raise this continue to shield and live with the constant reminder of the impact that the virus can have on they because they be not able to take the vaccine and they do not have the necessary level of protection for their own health need to be able to return to anything like near normal lifestyle he mention evusheld and evusheld and very much support the right of clinically vulnerable community to access those drug so that they can regain the freedom that we have all benefit from will continue to communicate with those community and where can seek to amplify their concern yes covid be part of the picture but across the board we have see an increase in the incidence of major condition such as cancer diabete and heart disease all of which have contribute to the figure on excess death the way to fight back against those number be to inform people responsibly about their health and wellbeing and about the measure that be in place to protect they it be also about ensure that our health service be fit for the future we need an nhs that be root in the community that it serve ensure that people can access care when and where they need it the nhs must embrace new technology as essential for diagnose and treat people as quickly as possible and it must move from be national sickness service to put prevention front and centre only by do so can we have an nhs that learn the lesson from the pandemic and ensure that where mistake be make in the past they be learn from and not repeat in future pandemic that be the kind of thing we need to do as parliament and it be the kind of thing that hope the next labour government will be able to do until then we will fully support the current government in make sure the message be send out loudly and clearly that the vaccine be the good way of protect yourself and your loved one from what be still terrible virus apology for my croaky voice will try to respond to all the point that can thank the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen for secure this important debate as the opposition have rightly say it be important that we have the debate in measured way because there be strong feeling on all side those who have concern about vaccine lockdown and the way pandemic be manage be right to raise they but it be also right and proper that people express the view that vaccine protect people and that difficult decision have to be make as the hon member for blackley and broughton graham stringer highlight it be much easy to come to different conclusion with hindsight it be really important that as we go forward still live with covid we continue our discussion in measured debate on all side in recent week we have see the impact of people not be able to speak freely about their concern regard the post office or the tavistock centre as say we have have number of debate on this issue include in january when acknowledge that the hon member for north west leicestershire be correct to say that we have see excess death in recent year however excess death be not new they be happen before covid and have happen since then as well it be important to look at the figure because the office for national statistics indicate that the number of excess death have be reduce year on year since the high in when there be excess death in england can only talk about england because health be obviously devolve and the government in scotland wales and northern ireland will have their own datum in that number go down to and in there be just excess death in england it be important to remember that every single one of those be person family member and love one but it may reassure hon member greatly as it do that the ons have report negative excess death for every week so far in after pandemic which we have be out of for quite some year we would expect deficit in death so why have we not have deficit for the past two year in which we have not have the covid pandemic the hon gentleman may have miss my last sentence before his intervention say that the ons datum show that in every week in so far we have have negative excess death that go specifically to his point we be not complacent though as set out in previous debate when we have see those rise in excess death and we have see significant excess death we have look at that datum to see the cause behind it whether it be the vaccine covid or other factor we have be work so hard and be really pleased that we be now start to see negative excess death let highlight some of the work that we have be do in look at those figure we have an incident of high flu prevalence in with peak of of flu test be positive that be highly likely to be because we lock down the country for two year and people immune system be not use to flu that be why last winter we bring forward our flu vaccine and extend it the year before to the over we recognise that people immunity to flu and respiratory illness be low because we have lock they down think that we need to be honest about that this winter as result we have see few admission and few death from flu and respiratory illness we have also see challenge with other health condition such as diabete and cardiac disease for which people would routinely have come forward for check routine treatment and access to appointment be difficult even now give the backlog of examination and test that need to happen when we look at this we see that last year the rate of death from cardiovascular disease be high than expect with there have be more than excess death that be why we be reinveste in our nhs health check it be on pause during covid when people could not get their blood pressure or cholesterol check and could not go on smoking prevention programme we restart those and as result excess death from cardiac disease be start to fall we want to use the opportunity to roll out our new digital health check we recognise that access to gps be sometimes difficult but this roll out be expect to deliver an additional million check in the first four year we also have million pilot to deliver cardiovascular check in the workplace again that be about make it as easy as possible for people to get check we have our pharmacy first roll out as well that be all for general health purpose we know that all these thing contribute to excess death rate want to touch on the crux of the matter which be the covid vaccine that have come through in all these debate be not health minister at the time so do not have to make these difficult decision but the hon member for blackley and broughton be absolutely right as the pandemic preparedness minister want the finding of the inquiry have to make difficult decision now about potential future pandemic that may never happen but could happen tomorrow we just do not know the result of the inquiry with regard to lockdown face mask and vaccine will all be really useful information and at the moment be not much the wiser on those result on module want to see any evidence about vaccine safety because that be how we learn think we be all sing from the same hymn sheet we want to do the good but during the pandemic when we watch tv footage from around the world and the medium be often push we to lock down hard fast and long we have to make difficult decision without the benefit of hindsight go back to the ward during covid and look after covid patient who be be treat for cancer we lose many of they and we lose number of staff too have see this from both side of the fence of all the concern point that the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen make in his opening speech particularly abhorrent be the suggestion that people who be not eligible for ventilator be essentially condemn to death that be deeply disturbing thing to say and it do not reflect my experience be privileged to volunteer on the frontline as the minister do and see staff battle as good they could to save people use all the medical treatment available whatever the patient age will the minister join in pay tribute to those staff who work so hard to save as many life as they could absolutely and thank my hon friend for his work during those difficult time we do not have vaccine in those day and we do not know how long covid be go to last reassure the relative who be listen to this debate that we treat every single patient in the good way we could if they need ventilator we often have to ship they out of hospital to get they to ventilator but they get one if they do not need ventilator we treat they we do not leave people to die and reassure relative who might think that we do that it certainly be not my experience of look after patient it be important to look at the datum on covid vaccination the office for national statistics publish datum last august show that people who receive vaccination have low mortality rate than those who have not be vaccinate give that of the population have be vaccinate with either one or two dos or multiple do it be almost impossible to determine correlation versus causation vaccinated people will feature highly in excess death number because most people have be vaccinate which be why we need to go through the datum really carefully and not just take the first datum at face value the covid virus continue to circulate and we be now live with covid some people be still very vulnerable to covid although the current variant be obviously less severe than the initial variant we have just have our spring vaccine roll out and those who be invite should please go to get their vaccine we know that it make difference to the most vulnerable over this winter after both the flu and covid vaccine roll out we have see significant reduction in hospital admission when will the immunosuppressed have access to evusheld will it be this week next week sometime or never that be clinical decision but now that we have the omicron variant the evidence for evusheld effectiveness be not as compelling return to the crux of the matter there be risk and benefit to every single medicine when the regulator or nice be weigh up whether to license or fund product if the advice come to we be that with omicron the benefit of evusheld do not outweigh the risk we have to take that advice people be not currently be advise to shield but recognise that people be very nervous particularly when they can not have the vaccine we be in constant touch with nice and the mhra on this but we have to respect their decision if it be feel that product will not benefit patient will the minister give way will give way one more time as have only few minute leave thank the minister for give way she be very generous use her medical experience can the minister explain to the house be befuddle by this how systemic vaccine inject into the arm into the blood and create an antibody response can stop an infection of the airway and lung by respiratory virus it have never happen and it do not happen this time either do it how can it do that that be actually what antibodie do will answer some of the many question that have be ask in this debate reiterate that no medicine or vaccine be completely risk free even simple paracetamol have the potential to kill people if it be not take properly and people with certain condition might not be able to take it at all we have monitor system in place the mhra which know have come under criticism take stand when in april follow concern raise through the yellow card system it reduce access for the and then for the when concern be raise it absolutely take action there be now recommendation about the type of vaccine and about whom we vaccinate bear in mind the current evidence have say that no vaccine be safe which be why we have the vaccine damage payment scheme hear concern about that and have meet my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope to discuss it we take the scheme off the department for work and pensions and move it into the department of health and social care to speed it up and get claim turn around more quickly we have have more than claim of which have be award roughly speak the majority of claim be decide on within six month and the vast majority be decide on within month of course we want to speed up on those we recognise the time limit of three year which be why we be work as hard as we can to get through as many claim as possible so that if people have be affect by the covid vaccine they get some help and support through that funding my hon friend the member for south basildon and east thurrock stephen metcalfe raise the issue of research we be absolutely research the issue of vaccine not just future type of vaccine but their safety there be million from the national institute for health and care research go specifically into vaccine safety and encourage all member to keep an eye on that as the evidence come forward have to give the hon member for north west leicestershire few minute to reply so will just say that we take this issue extremely seriously know that as minister will be responsible will the minister give way will not as have to let the hon member for north west leicestershire respond we take this issue very seriously have be as open and transparent as can be if there be concern we will always look into they but there be no doubt that covid vaccine save life there be no doubt that some people have experience harm from they we acknowledge that and we want to help and support people who have be affect but the vaccine do get we out of the pandemic and we need to be mindful of that as well with the leave of the house mr deputy speaker let thank all the hon member who have take part in debate that have be robust as it should be give the gravity of the issue wish this debate be not need wish the experimental vaccine be safe and effective but they be not the long we go on not admit the problem the big the problem that will come and the great the harm that will continue to be cause those in this house can continue to deny that the vaccine be cause harm and death and the legacy medium can continue to censor all report of vaccine harm and excess death but the people know in increase number because they be the one who be lose their love one and relative urge the government release the control level datum and

interim report of the infected blood inquiry without delay and the petitioner remain etc new build homes standards north yorkshire motion make and question propose that this house do now largan may start by thank you mr deputy speaker and through you mr speaker for grant this debate value the opportunity to raise issue during this adjournment debate perhaps no one value that more than the hon member for strangford jim shannon who be usually fixture at these moment but have send his apology for not be here today have mention the new housing development and estate be build across harrogate and knaresborough in the house before indeed have be run fair deal for new estate campaign the essence of which be to ensure new estate be finish in timely way within fair deal mean both the length of time involve and the quality of work by house builder the campaign have be run for over year it start when resident in new build property come to to seek support for the problem they be have with their new home be of course extremely happy to help with their case and take they up on their behalf with house builder have make visit to see the issue at first hand and correspond and meet with house builder there be too many individual case to detail in this debate we be talk about over case locate across harrogate knaresborough and some surround village so the issue be not limit to specific geography the development include king croft garten close harlow green swincliffe mews and other there be great variety of issue both in range and severity but they can be divide into two group issue with individual property and estate wide issue estate wide issue cover matter such as drainage road surfacing street lighting street signage and play area or simply be good neighbour during the final build out of an estate by keep road as clean as possible and make consideration for delivery time and the type of vehicle use have have complaint about how long it have be take to finish estate and how the focus can seem to move on when much of an estate have be sell one issue that be regularly raise be about drainage for open space play area or individual home have see block drain as well as stand water significant enough to reach front door and threaten to flood individual property which be very worrying for resident equally have see huge excavation and remedial work from house builder indicate that they have be take action and show how much work be require to put thing right on issue face individual property we must remember that new home be not just financial transaction but major step in anyone life it be emotional and exciting but move house can also be stressful however it should not be the start of long chain of dealing with the house builder to correct problem issue raise with range from totally inadequate guttering to very patchy fitting of insulation from window pane separate from their frame to poorly fit bannister and from wall have to be rebuild to bathroom have to be take out and replacement fit that be just snapshot because the list be long have be deal with number of different house building company national and local large and small include taylor wimpey avant homes and harron homes this debate be about speak up for individual but it be possible to draw some theme together because there be some common element which will highlight the first be to get it right first time resident know that there be likely to be some snag when they move into new build people be sensible and they be practical but that be not what be talk about in some case the sheer number and scale of they have simply be wrong one resident forward his list to and it be more than item long then there be the severity of the problem have meet resident who have have whole bathroom take out and refit or who have have to totally move out of their property during remedial work with all the disruption that that bring be think of one case where that be especially true because they have young family another common problem have be the way that customer have be deal with during this process which have be source of deep frustration resident have report challenge contact customer service the frequency of staff change have be cite which mean that be no continuity of understanding of the issue raise also cite be the need for house builder to be more proactive in their communication that basically mean get information out to everyone about what be happen and when keep people inform have raise this point with house builder and in all case they have recognise that there have be communication problem no one have attempt to deny it and indeed they have seek to correct they in some case this have mean new customer service helpline for development and in other case it have mean more senior oversight of outstanding issue mention at the start of my speech that the time take to solve problem have be too long again to be fair to all some case have be resolve quickly but can think of place where some resident have be live for three year that have yet to see finished road surface or finished open space that be simply too long when start this fair deal for new estate campaign it be specifically to support constituent in harrogate knaresborough and the surround village but have also be contact by number colleague from right across the house who have be experience similar problem in their constituency too this problem be obviously much more widespread and be perhaps something for the ministerial team to consider be absolutely sure that we need more new housing in this country but win the argument for it mean that house be deliver in way that enhance community and where the build quality be high harrogate knaresborough and the surround village be hugely desirable place in which to live we have strong economy quality service high quality of life and powerful sense of community it be not therefore surprising that the demand and need for housing be high but this be all about get it right for resident have be happy to take up case and urge anyone struggle with issue in their new build to get in touch with as will be happy to help they that be about issue resolution and that be obviously important but also want to ask how we ensure that we do not have issue to resolve in the first place how do we ensure that we get thing right first time have few request for my hon friend the minister in his department dealing and conversation with the sector how be quality monitor can the new home ombudsman play big role there be new home quality code which detail fundamental principle that register developer have to follow but what happen if developer be not register and if the principle be not follow one challenge raise by house builder have be difficulty in get the skill they need in the workforce they have experience shortage of people with the necessary skill that be quite common feature in an economy that have be strong in job creation can more be do to develop supply chain of skill via apprenticeship know that my hon friend the minister have strong view about apprenticeship this important point apply not just to house builder but to their supplier have have several conversation in which supplier failure have be cite and change of supplier have lead to problem be resolve look far ahead know that the government be work on future home and building standard particularly around energy efficiency microgeneration and insulation and that be positive work would be grateful therefore if the minister could update the house basically want to see more people own their own quality home and experience happy future when they move in thank my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough andrew jones for secure this important debate the minister for housing planning and building safety have ask to offer he meeting to discuss these matter in great detail as fellow yorkshireman bear and breed know that my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough share my enormous pride in represent constituency in god own country have huge respect for his tireless work over the year to promote the interest of the hard work people and family of north yorkshire his constituency like mine be make up of strong community that be proud of their past and aspirational for their future which he and know must be build on bedrock of good quality housing safe warm decent affordable home that provide the solid foundation that people need to get on in life and unlock their potential good home hold the key to our plan to level up opportunity across yorkshire and around the country while help our local economy to grow that be why be proud to support the secretary of state and the minister for housing planning and building safety in deliver those home through our long term plan for housing with million new home build in total since of which be in yorkshire and the humber however as my hon friend rightly say the standard of some new build and the estate that they be part of be simply not up to scratch like he have hear of case where developer be move on to new project before the place that they be build be properly finish leave resident to deal with the extensive snagging or to live in limbo on unadopted road such as those in the estate that he mention that be not fair not right and frankly not on while recognise that most new development across the country be already of decent standard construct by the many good building firm operate nationwide we be clear that more need to be do to address homebuyer concern where standard have fall short we have be take action to ensure that happen reform building control as part of the big change to the construction sector in generation and strengthen warranty to give homebuyer great protection my hon friend ask how my department monitor quality in our work with the sector and whether the new home ombudsman will play big role be pleased to tell he that quality be at the heart of our plan from the future home standard to our work to improve redress with the new home ombudsman which once launch will help to drive up quality across the industry my hon friend also ask what happen if developer be not register with the new home quality code the new home quality code be voluntary but through the building safety act we legislate so that we can bring forward single code of conduct which will be statutory that be also recommend in the recent competition and markets authority report to which we will soon publish our response my hon friend ask about the shortage of relevant skill in the workforce and whether apprenticeship can help to address it as former apprentice that subject be close to my heart as know it be to his that be why be delighted to tell he that we be already work to boost skill training across the industry by fully funding for young people up to the age of new apprenticeship work for small business and that we have amend the apprenticeship levy so that small and medium sized enterprise will have great opportunity to develop the skill that the industry need my hon friend request an update on future home and building standard particularly in relation to energy efficiency can tell he that from next year the future home standard will ensure that all new home produce on average upwards of less carbon dioxide emission than those build to the requirement through the work of our new building safety regulator introduce under the building safety act we be improve construction standard across the industry let directly address some of the constituency matter that my hon friend raise local authority can use section planning obligation to secure commitment from developer to provide appropriate facility for new build project such as those he mention include play area road and drainage it be up to developer and local planning authority to agree matter relate to the timing and funding of delivery and it be right that local authority retain such decision in the meantime we be work with the building industry to ensure that it take this issue seriously ultimately it be private developer not the state that hold the key to raise standard only by local and central government work together with developer can we ensure that new home be build in yorkshire and across the country be safe decent warm and finish to high standard and that buyer in my hon friend constituency and elsewhere be treat fairly we must all play our part to ensure that that happen question put and agree to house adjourn
