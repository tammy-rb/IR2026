tribunal without the need for new evidence give that the uk government will be examine today by the un committee on the rights of persons with disabilities follow its special inquiry that find that the threshold have be meet for grave and systematic violation be it not time to replace the flawed and outdated pip system with framework that be fit for purpose of course we always keep all benefit under review at the department include pip and the assessment process as the hon lady point out there be rightly an appeal process for those who be not happy with the conclusion of those assessment we keep those under review and can reassure she that they represent relatively small proportion of the total number of application regional variations unemployment and inactivity what recent assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of regional variation in level of employment and inactivity the regional employment gap be significantly low than in jobcentres take place base approach to deliver targeted support that reflect local need and the local economy health equity north research show high level of economic inactivity in the north east due to disability or ill above the national average visit the jobcentre in newcastle and be very impressed by the dedication and hard work of the staff but know from the public and commercial services union that one in four universal credit manager take time off in for mental illness which be three time the figure before we be the only country in the not to have the same level of employment as before the pandemic be those high rate not because of record nhs waiting list low staff morale and general government incompetence as the hon lady find within our jobcentre we have highly skilled people help people to find work we have high number of people with disability in work than in more than million and we intend to ensure that work coach can work carefully and sensitively and attend to people need in recent month the welsh affairs committee have hear from young adult about their experience with the benefit system we have be strike by how this group of young people want to work and feel that they can work but they have be write off as long term sick and pass to the long term sickness benefit roll by jobcentre they feel incredibly let down do the minister agree that we can not afford to be sign off so many of our young people on long term sickness that be why we have workwell the back to work plan and the occupational health group lead by dame carol black look into fit note reform it be also why we have youth employment coach and the youth hub we be work to ensure that there be the right attenuate support include kickstart the sector base work academy programme and boot camp only last week meet steph who be year out of work and grateful for the help that she have have help people into work what step he be take to help people into work jobcentre plus provide variety of different support to

hon friend agree that it be important that school and business work together to ensure that young people have the qualification and skill they need to progress into work once they finish full time education could not agree more with my hon friend it be exactly why we have youth hub provide advice and support on not just get into work but other important matter to young people such as housing their health and debt management be talk to the royal national institute of blind people which represent the blind and partially sight it tell of an employee who say be newly employ and be unable to fulfil my role it have be extremely stressful and frustrating and this be because of access to work do the minister agree that without have access to work in place within the first four week of someone enter work it be incredibly difficult for they to maintain that position be pleased that the hon lady raise access to work because it be extremely effective the grant can be there year in year out and be up to maximum of along with other approach it have very much lead to our meeting our employment goal for disabled people in half the time that we set in over million more disabled people be in work by what be the government do to use apprenticeship to help young people engage with the labour market to tackle level of economic inactivity and to give they the opportunity they need to get the career that they want my right hon friend raise economic inactivity which be low in our country than in the united states france and italy it be below the average of the oecd the and the european union apprenticeship play very important part in produce those good figure though there be of course always more to be do not least through our approach of engage extremely closely with employer both at the national level and through our jobcentre as somebody who have fight really hard over the last four year to overcome the difficulty present by long covid be sure that the secretary of state will appreciate that significant number of the people not in work because of health condition will have some form of post viral fatigue link to long covid what assessment have he make of the effect of long covid on the workforce and what be he do to help people who have it get back to work the hon gentleman specifically raise long covid which be one of many health pressure in our society and post covid in many other country that be also affect by the virus we have number of approach include universal support which place people in employment and give they critical support for up to month we also have workwell and we be look at occupational health and what tax incentive we might put in place to encourage employer to do more on that front we be do great deal call the shadow minister arguably the big barrier to growth in the uk and to turn around the prime minister recession be the supply of labour follow the chancellor back to work budget in the autumn and all the measure unveil since then some of which the secretary of state have just reel off do the office for budget responsibility upgrade or downgrade its forecast on employment growth in the budget day ago one of the most important figure in the spring budget economic and fiscal outlook be recognition by the obr that there will be net more people in employment as consequence of that fiscal event and the one that precede it in the autumn what the hon lady can not get away from be that economic inactivity in our country be at low level than in every year under the last labour government what the secretary of state can not get away from be the fact that as have already be say our employment rate have not return to the post pandemic level he can not answer the question because the truth be that the obr downgrade its forecast the unemployment forecast be bad the reason for that be truth that the british people have know for long time now these ministers sit on the treasury bench have no idea no plan for job no plan for growth they be do it be time for general election have already refer to the additional job that the obr suggest in its forecast but the hon lady can not get away from the fact that we have record level of payroll employment in our country and near record low unemployment let we contrast that with labour record it always leave unemployment higher than when it come into office economic inactivity be high than it be now in each year of the previous labour government and we have more people in absolute poverty after housing cost under labour as direct consequence welfare reforms what his plan timetable be for the roll out of welfare reform we be bring forward number of important reform to our welfare system at pace phase of our universal support have already be activate and phase will be later this year next month we will announce workwell area about third of england that have be successfully select and will be roll out live this autumn thank the secretary of state for list all those reform the data be clear that after week out of work the chance of someone find work start to fall off rapidly therefore there be need for more intensive and tailor support could he update the house on the additional jobcentre support roll out and when my constituent might get access to those benefit we be keen to do that ajs to which my hon friend refer have be roll out in part of the country at six week but shortly will be extend and strengthen for two week at the week stage of the unemployment journey that be part of the more intensive condition that we apply to ensure that we help and in many circumstance require people to go back into work some of the poor people know in my constituency work for themselves hill farmer have see drop in their income over the last four year the welfare system do not work for they because they be pay less than the minimum wage access to universal credit be less for they because of the minimum income floor will the secretary of state urgently look at that so that small business owner especially hill farmer in my constituency be not make even poor because of the government rule the hon gentleman be right inasmuch as universal credit for the self employ have to recognise the fact that sometimes there be inconsistent level of income month to month that be why we have minimum income floor and the arrangement around that know he have rural agricultural constituency recognise some of those issue and be look closely at they social security benefit vulnerable people what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of his department support for vulnerable people who claim social security benefit in british sign language happy sign language week everybody it be key priority for the department for work and pensions to provide effective support for our vulnerable customer we provide training on how to support customer mental health and we have six point plan for support claimant who may be at risk of suicide or self harm the dwp regularly review process to make improvement through colleague and customer feedback and through the work of the serious case panel the government estimate that of household on legacy benefit would fail to move to universal credit under manage migration however by last december have not manage to do so and as result have their benefit stop this be matter of real concern the dwp will now ask more vulnerable people who be wholly reliant on benefit to transfer what will the government do to ensure that those vulnerable people do not fall out of the social security system thank the hon lady for her point about vulnerable customer who have come into our curtilage and purview the minister for employment have remind that we will take this very slowly and will engage with and support customer customer can speak to help to claim adviser at citizens advice and we will ensure that we listen to they in addition to the financial support provide to personal independence payment claimant what progress be be make to refer claimant proactively to the wide support available in their community thank my hon friend for highlight this point there be the household support fund help to claim and opportunity to pop into the local library to get additional support for example there be also an extra million out there on top of the billion through to the end of this month would say to anybody the benefit calculator be out there and do talk to the cab and your local in swindon today the government be in geneva defend their policy to the un committee that be investigate the uk for breach of the convention on the right of person with disability include article on the right of disabled people to social protection give that drastically cut disabled people social security support between and and austerity be find to be responsible for avoidable death how will the new wave of austerity announce in the budget affect the health and wellbeing of disabled people be pleased to have

difficulty in fill vacancy with local people particularly in the food and drink sector the seafood sector in particular be still in transition away from dependency on overseas worker which could take some year what datum can the dwp provide on the measure that local business have take to maximise the employment of local people and what other support can the department offer to attract worker to area of low unemployment such as banff and buchan there be the wage pay through the rise in the national living wage my hon friend local jobcentre and the range of access to support be sure we will be discuss all these issue tomorrow at the roundtable with seafood processor that will be attend along with the minister for legal migration and the border my hon friend the member for corby tom pursglove call the chair of the select committee large number of people in banff and buchan be economically inactive they be not claim benefit so they be not eligible for employment support from jobcentre but the select committee recommend last summer that such people should be eligible would that not be in their interest and in the interest of employer struggle to fill vacant post at the moment and therefore supportive of much need economic growth we always take these matter very seriously and keep they under full review cost of living food bank use what recent assessment his department have make of the potential impact of change in the cost of live on level of food bank use what recent assessment his department have make of the potential impact of change in the cost of live on level of food bank use food bank be independent organisation with dwp have no direct role in their operation we do however monitor the use of food bank through the family resource survey and the next instalment of that will be later this month nearly people need help from ealing foodbank last year some of they be child under it be amazing that the food bank and its volunteer be there to help but it be national shame that it be need what be the government plan to reduce dependence on food bank this be the government who have oversee reduction in the number of child in absolute poverty since despite the chuntering from the opposition front bench unfortunately the figure be far bad under the last labour government than they may be at the moment the hon gentleman ask directly what we be do we be again put up the national living wage by substantially more than inflation this april the chancellor have already bring in national insurance cut that will be worth to the average earner benefit themselves be go up by next month we have also change the arrangement for local housing allowance which mean that million people many of whom be on very low income will be well off by an average of year while on the campaign trail meet the daylight centre and serve rushden both have see their service user increase in number even with the extension of the household support fund which they both welcome what can the secretary of state do to expand the eligibility of the fund improve uptake and increase the value of the healthy start payment may welcome the hon lady to her place in answer to her question will simply point out that there be much speculation before the spring budget about whether the housing support fund be go to be extend in my opinion the chancellor take exactly the right approach and the fund have now be extend for further six month call the snp spokesperson research from the trussell trust reveal the devastating truth more than half of people receive universal credit run out of food in january and could not afford more and million universal credit claimant have fall into debt because they could not keep up with essential bill will the secretary of state back the trussell trust joint campaign with the joseph rowntree foundation and commit to legislate for an essential guarantee in universal credit to reduce food bank use and ensure that everyone have protect minimum amount of support in order to afford life essential yes or no the most important thing be that this government recognise that the good way out of poverty and the good way to address the circumstance that the hon lady describe be through work that be why the chancellor reduce taxation make work pay ever more and why the national living wage be to be increase by close to this april follow similar increase around this time last year benefit be go up by and increase by this time last year have already mention local housing allowance and of course we have now have eight consecutive month of real wage growth as inflation have fall jobcentre darlington what step his department be take to increase the support offer by jobcentres in darlington the team be work tirelessly with darlington borough council tees valley combined authority and other partner to deliver through job fair swap and skill bootcamp thank my hon friend for her answer and may be the first in the chamber to wish she very happy birthday in addition to the issue that she have highlight may highlight the wonderful work that darlington jobcentre have do in set up its facebook page do she agree that it be template for other to follow and will she come to darlington and meet my fantastic work coach thank my hon friend it be seemingly quite large number on my birthday card today my hon friend have be fantastic champion of his local jobcentre and have campaign vigorously to ensure that darlington be at the forefront of innovation will be meet his team in april have be to seven jobcentre since the last dwp question and will make sure that his work coach be at the top of my list the minister in her response to the hon member for darlington peter gibson have emphasise what she will do for his local jobcentre whatever she will do for darlington she will also do for the rest of the united kingdom include my constituency of strangford across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland how can we work well with further education college to get our young people ready for the job that become available talk regularly to colleague in the department for education ensure that those skilled boot camp swap make people job ready because they have not only the experience but guarantee interview that be the way we be drive those number up support for pensioners what step his department be take to support pensioner what step his department be take to support pensioner what step his department be take to support pensioner in we will spend over billion on benefit for pensioner in great of gdp include forecast billion on the state pension thank my hon friend for his reply south derbyshire pensioner have be in touch with follow the budget email to say that it seem to offer they nothing would he be kind enough to set out today the help that the government have give and be give to pensioner to help they realise that nothing be far from the reality of what conservative government be give they be grateful for that question the answer could not be far from nothing this be government with prove track record of support pensioner include our commitment to the triple lock in april we will see the state pension raise by this year after an increase of last year mean that it will be full high in cash term than it be in very much welcome the record on support pensioner that my hon friend have just outline number of pensioner in my constituency have contact about the effect of fiscal drag they may have very modest private pension that be now be drag into tax when they never expect it to be what step be my hon friend take in conjunction with the treasury to ensure that we can get pensioner on modest private pension out of tax this be the government who have nearly double the personal allowance since ensure that most of the low earner do not pay income tax indeed thank to the personal allowance around of individual do not pay tax and of course any pensioner solely reliant on the state pension do not pay income tax do my hon friend agree with that while the conservative proudly continue to support pensioner in their hard earn retirement with the triple lock and other cost of live support measure it be disgraceful that the labour mayor of london have hammer pensioner and work people in bexley by increase council tax by approximately per year and ultra low emission zone charge to per day be sure my hon friend agree with that the mayor of london seem to spend more time pay extremely expensive salary to some of his key employee around greater london of course ulez have an effect on pensioner whether they be go to the shop visit their family or attend hospital appointment they will be the one to pay the price for the mayor overweene ambition in early december my constituent be inform by the dwp that they must renew their personal independence payment entitlement they be tell that if the necessary form be not return by january their pip could be stop on christmas day the dwp inform my constituent that as the form have not be return their pip entitlement have be stop and they owe some money my constituent return the form in early january long before the deadline but they have have no response since then and nor have they receive their benefit could implore the minister to intervene in this astounding case and work out exactly how this error could have occur thank the hon lady for her question if she write to with further detail will ensure that the relevant minister be able to look into the case with more than million pensioner now pay income tax many as we have just hear as result of frozen allowance and almost million not receive pension credit to which they be rightly entitle do the minister think it might be time to improve the uptake of pension credit be pleased to be able to say that application to receive pension credit be currently increase quarter on quarter indicate dissent if the hon gentleman will wait and listen to the answer will explain what we be do to increase uptake of pension credit not only do we have major nationwide campaign our late one feature harry redknapp we be also carry out experimental campaign such as write to all those pensioner who be in receipt of housing benefit to make sure that those most likely to be eligible for pension credit be be target to take it up it be all very well people apply for pension credit but the well advice centre in my constituency have identify massive delay in people get the pension credit for which they be eligible one constituent get in touch with in february have apply for pension credit in august and they be still wait for the application to be resolve result in backdating of more than would that money not have be much well in the pocket of pensioner who need it right then rather than wait indefinitely for the dwp to get back to they be obviously disappointed to hear of that constituent experience but it be not something hear very often about pension credit we have an excellent delivery record and an extremely low level of complaint southend indomitable pensioner and waspi woman frances neil and deborah dalton come to see on friday on behalf of the waspi woman across southend with the ombudsman final report due within week will the secretary of state please commit to come to the house to make statement so that these issue can be fully air as be sure my hon friend be all too aware be not able to comment until the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report be publish when will this miserable government wake up to the fact that there be shortage of skilled labour in this country and at the same time that we have an army of pensioner who could be retain in the workforce if they be give the right incentive to carry on work there be good relationship between work and stay healthy so will the minister act be not sure whether the hon gentleman be volunteer himself for post commons career but there be many job opportunity for pensioner across the country indeed many people work on attendance allowance in my part of blackpool be in their and and they be do fantastic job we put an awful lot of effort not just through the mid life mot but through the old worker support in our jobcentre to make sure that we match jobseeker to the right job for they call the shadow minister time and again pensioner have be let down by this government they suspend the triple lock break key manifesto promise their disastrous mini budget knock hundred of billion of pound from pension pot and their failure to get grip on the cost of living mean that pensioner be mainly live in cold home over the winter and have choice between heating or eat against this backdrop be the minister at all surprised that almost one in five pensioner be now live in poverty it be as if the shadow minister have not notice the almost of cost of living payment make to pension credit recipient across the country over the last year know the opposition have rely on last week resolution foundation report to criticise what we be do but this be what the report actually say pensioners use to be by far the most likely to be in poverty now they be the least likely this change in the relationship between old age and low income be one of the most profound social and economic change this country have see we achieve that under this government not under our fail labour predecessor rural poverty benefit system what step he be take through the benefit system to tackle poverty in rural area we be bear down on poverty not least by incentivise work within the benefit system as the hon gentleman will know we have reduce the universal credit taper for example which have lead to record level of payroll employment and near record low unemployment commission poverty report for the arfon constituency from the highly respect bevan foundation copy be available online in welsh and english one finding be that of the people receive both universal credit and housing benefit in arfon be pay the bedroom tax compare with across wales this be cushion to some extent by the gwynedd local authority discretionary help but will the minister review the differential negative effect of the bedroom tax between community particularly those with diminished housing stock because of for example high level of holiday home thank the hon gentleman for refer to that report which will look at with interest of course there be no such thing as bedroom tax as it be not tax at all it be spare room subsidy it be there for very good reason to free up additional space for those who need it on the housing front as say early local housing allowance have be improve such that million people on low income in the private rent sector will be on average year well off come april one of the good way to tackle poverty in rural area such as ynys môn be through job fair will the secretary of state join in thank alwen gardiner and my brilliant ynys môn dwp team for organise an excellent tourism and hospitality job fair which be attend by over jobseeker in llangefni and company such as tredici butchers deli in beaumaris and the breeze hill in benllech diolch yn fawr thank my hon friend for draw attention to her job fair she be local dynamo in stand up for her constituent when arrive there recently think be very special to support yet another job fair disability job fair be quickly remind of the fact that be the minister to have be to her constituency in think the past month housing benefit landlords what step he be take to tackle non payment of housing benefit to district council when the beneficiary be not register social landlord the supported housing regulatory oversight act bring reform to the support housing sector to improve quality and value for money any change to funding model would need to be consider in the context of those broad reform but we keep the subsidy policy under review charnwood borough council currently contribute million year to subsidise the support housing benefit payment to local charity which be unable to become registered social landlord the charity provide excellent support and accommodation to those suffer from addiction or ex offender undergo rehabilitation however the cost to the council be unsustainable please will my hon friend look at fund those service as the department for work and pensions currently do for similar organisation that be register social landlord thank my hon friend for raise this issue the challenging fiscal environment mean that we need to prioritise resource and ensure that support be target effectively to maximise impact for citizen chair cross government group with the department for levelling up housing and communities on quality issue and other matter such as subsidy loss which she raise we will continue to review and monitor the concern that she and other local authority have raise however point to the local housing allowance uplift which be central focus for personal independence payment claims what recent estimate he have make of the average time it take for claimant to complete medical assessment for personal independence payment claim we treat all claimant individually recognise the differ need of health condition and disability and the impact on claimant daily live the length of time for an assessment be not include in the contract between the dwp and provider but can confirm that the average time for be minute be heartbroken to hear the experience of constituent who have to go through an enhance medical assessment for pip bowel cancer survivor with severe arthritis she be make to stay on phone call for over three hour to be assess that mean that due to her need she have to suffer the indignity of soil herself just to complete the assessment how on earth can that be okay would like to understand what step be be take to reduce the time of these assessment and to hear what can be do to ensure they be finally undertake with basic human compassion thank the hon gentleman for raise distressing case the dwp be commit to assess people as quickly as possible be happy to look into that particular situation to see why in this case the support the claimant be entitle to do not come promptly prioritise the reduction of processing time to maximise the number of assessment complete without affect quality be key but be very happy to take that case away call the shadow minister the department for work and pensions have staggering outstanding pip claim the average clearance time be currently week people be wait almost four month for decision which can have significant impact on physical and mental health what be the minister do to improve clearance time so that people be not leave in limbo worry about whether they can afford the extra cost associate with their disability or long term health condition the government urgently need to get grip claimant satisfaction have remain above the service level of or high as of the three month average that begin in september the to end clearance time from registration to decision be make be currently week which have be reduce from week in august interruption the hon lady ask very gently what we be do we have multi channel assessment and be engage regularly with my official twice month to ensure that we be assess the queue and the delay and as say at the start of this question that we be treat everybody individually and in tailored and suitable way child poverty what step his department be take to help reduce the number of child in poverty what step his department be take to help reduce the number of child in poverty we be reduce child poverty through the use of large number of measure not least ensure that work pay hence our increase in the national living wage in april and the reduction in the national insurance tax that my right hon friend the chancellor announce recently total of child will be keep clear of poverty this year thank to the scottish government policy primarily the scottish child payment surely the secretary of state must now look to roll out some of our policy in other part of the uk and at the very least ditch the two child limit which deliberately force child into poverty the limit to which the hon gentleman refer be there for very good reason which be that people in those circumstance should face the same basic decision as those not on benefit that be an important matter of fairness across those who receive benefit as well as the many who be pay tax as for the number of child in poverty that have fall by since many of those people be in work secretary of state some million have be pay to more than child family in renfrewshire thank to the widely praise scottish child payment praise have come from the institute for public policy research scotland which say that the scottish government be make employment for parent central to their child poverty strategy but it say that devolve employment support programme be hold back by responsibility be split across government and reserved jobcentre system which be more often focus on compliance than help people reach their full potential it recommend the full devolution of employment support to tackle child poverty will the secretary of state listen to the expert be always very interested in listen to the hon gentleman and any idea that he have about how we should improve our welfare system but point to the fact that this country have see considerable drop in absolute child poverty after housing cost of since what correlation do the secretary of state see between child in poverty and workless family give that there be no age restriction on most apprenticeship and today announcement that there will be more apprenticeship and that the apprenticeship levy can be spend on great number of contractor and sub contractor what opportunity do he see for his department to highlight those opportunity for people who be of work age and who may have child in poverty my hon friend refer to workless household he be absolutely right about the correlation child be five time more likely to be in poverty if they be grow up in workless household he be right to draw attention to the announcement that have be make today about even great investment in apprenticeship and also the change in the way that the apprenticeship levy work so that supply chain can benefit to great degree topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility may join the house in say happy birthday to the minister for employment my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds jo churchill it should be national holiday as far as be concern perhaps that be an idea for private member bill or something similar be pleased that since the last question we have publish our review into autism employment and place on record my thank to my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland who do such excellent work in bring that useful report forward look forward from april we will see benefit generally rise by the state pension by the national living wage by around and the next tranche of the household support fund be bring forward as have already set out our plan be work it mean more employment historically low unemployment and an economic inactivity rate below country such as the united states france and italy the economic inactivity rate be now very high with million people cite long term sickness as reason some million day of work be lose at cost of billion to the economy have the secretary of state see the policy exchange report publish today with policy proposal back by two of his predecessor david blunkett and my right hon friend the member for norwich north chloe smith what step be the government take to improve the provision of workplace health service through occupational health pathway and vocational rehabilitation and will he consider the proposal in the policy exchange report will of course look closely at the report that my right hon friend refer to indeed reach out to he recently to invite he to the department to discuss that and other matter with regard to long term sickness and disability we be work on an array of intervention include occupational health support within business workwell bring together medical intervention with work coach universal support to help people into work and to stay in work with that support and fundamental reform of the work capability assessment such that the obr say that few people will go on to those benefit go forward call the shadow secretary of state in the budget the chancellor say that he want to end national insurance contribution because the double taxation of work be unfair official report march vol people nic record help to determine their entitlement to the state pension so if national insurance be scrap how will they know what pension they will get be not surprised that the hon lady bring that up because be well aware of the position that her party have take on the announcement that we have make she will be clear in her own mind that the chancellor have not guarantee that we will reduce at one stroke national insurance contribution it be an aspiration that have be speak about as occur over number of year if not parliaments so the problem that she be conjure up to frighten pensioner be nothing short of political scaremongering the secretary of state can bluster and deny all he like but the prime minister tell the sunday times we want to end this double taxation on work it be there in black and white so let try again how will people pension entitlement be determine if nic be scrap and if the government be go to merge nic with income tax what will that mean for pensioner tax bill be the truth not that their unfunded billion plan to scrap nic be yet more chaos from the conservatives and britain pensioner deserve so much well the hon lady quote from the sunday times and scribble it down we want to end this double taxation of course we do but that be not the same as near term pledge it be long term we have be quite upfront quite if she would care to hear out it be quite unlike the billion firm commitment that her party make and subsequently turn on which be nothing short of fiscally reckless and would have lead to increase in

child poverty rate and would lift child out of poverty overnight surely one child grow up in poverty be one child too many the secretary of state should reverse course on this and the labour party should also commit to scrap the two child limit do the secretary of state agree that no child should grow up in poverty and will he take action to ensure that that stop now the hon lady raise the same point as her colleague the hon member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east stuart mcdonald about the two child limit will not detain the house by repeat exactly the same answer other than to agree passionately with she that one child in poverty be one too many and to say that although we have far to go it be important to recognise that we have reduce the number of child in absolute

roll out those migration notice by march we intend to publish datum for the hon gentleman constituency we be committed to ensure that the transition work as smoothly as possible for everyone have the minister make any recent assessment of what trade or occupation be short of worker at the moment and what step be be take to persuade people perhaps more experienced people back into the workforce to fill those vacancy we be work with other departments employer and stakeholder to isolate where those vacancy be and on sector base work academy programme we have put over people through construction care tourism hospitality all those gap that we need to fill of people currently claim tax credit be not move over to universal credit in the migration the department tell we that those who be not claim would have get median amount of year will the minister assure and the house that she be do everything she can to ensure that people be get the money that they be owe assure the hon lady that we be keep close eye on the issue but ultimately it be the customer responsibility to claim gently point out that we have be roll out the migration in her constituency since may with not one complaint there be plenty of help available to those people as they transition as my right hon friend will know fast diagnosis and treatment be key to get people back into work what representation have he make to his departmental and cabinet colleague to ensure that that be the case thank my hon friend and near neighbour for her question know that she care deeply about the issue that she have raise we work closely with other departments for example we work with the department of health and social care on nhs talk therapy of which we have announce more over the next five year as well as on workwell which have mention and on fit note reform with the department for levelling up housing and communities we be work closely on housing have speak about the local housing allowance change come through and with the department for education we be work on swap and on training and apprenticeship school general practitioner social service charity and housing association can all refer their client to food bank in an emergency yet this government who be responsible for benefit sanction have order dwp staff to stop refer claimant to food bank how can minister justify this decision to the family of the child live in poverty in my east durham constituency may make it clear that that be just scaremongere the dwp have not change its policy there be merely improvement be make to the signpost slip so that we comply with our obligation under the gdpr we continue to provide guidance to customer signpost they to emergency support as be right couple in my constituency recently receive an apologetic letter from the department for work and pensions that set out catalogue of mistake that it have make those mistake almost lead to their lose their home which cause they enormous stress my constituent be now wait for decision on the compensation that they may receive will my right hon friend look into the case and ensure that decision be take as quickly as possible to save my constituent any further stress thank my hon friend for raise this matter obviously can not comment on an individual case however be very happy to look closely into the matter he have raise and either or relevant minister will be happy to meet he the number of the long term sick have rise from million pre pandemic to million today this huge increase start in spring at the same time as the roll out of the experimental emergency use vaccine or do the secretary of state have an alternative explanation for the unprecedented rise in long term sickness in the uk since spring among the major driver of the increase to which the hon gentleman refer be mental health issue and musculoskeletal issue be not entirely sure that he be accurate when he say that the upward trajectory in the number occur just as vaccination occur think it predate that moment and certainly do not subscribe to the view that vaccination be in any way unsafe for many year the department publish statistic give breakdown of welfare claim by nationality although the department still have the datum it no long publish the statistic will the minister look again at that and start publish those important statistic once again thank my hon friend but would like to inform he that at the moment there be no plan to recommence the publication of those statistic the last labour government lift million child out of poverty after year of tory government we have million child in destitution what have go wrong have to take issue with the hon gentleman he need to look more closely at his party record in government fact no be that the labour party always leave office with high unemployment fact no be that economic inactivity in our country be low than in any year in his party time in office fact no be that absolute poverty have decline in our country since his party be in office fact no be that there be more child in workless household on his watch than there be on our perhaps most tellingly of all during his party time in office over million people languish on long term benefit for almost decade that be disgraceful record one of the most challenging group of people to get back into the workforce be those in their and whose job disappear during covid they have possibly fall back on their personal pension although with inflation that money be be eat away what action be my hon friend take to get those people back into work and to encourage they into job that be valuable and improve our productivity thank my hon friend for that question would ask people to go to their jobcentre which can help they build their cv and their confidence we have champion across all district and midlife mot for one think that work in my and now my be very good idea indeed the two wellbee hub in my constituency in brora and dunbeath be crucial to the wellbeing of pensioner they signpost the good mix of benefit and be last safety net but their future be uncertain because of the vagary of nhs scotland finance will minister meet to discuss how we can safeguard the future of these two centre be always happy to have debate with the hon gentleman we sit next to each other almost every morning in portcullis house and be sure that we can have conversation aylesbury be wonderful place to live work visit and invest in but sadly we have some area of economic deprivation opportunity bucks run by buckinghamshire council have identify aylesbury north and aylesbury north west as area for extra attention where we could improve education training and skill how can my hon friend department assist such initiative in get more aylesbury resident into work we be work with employer and jobcentre on the sector base work academy programme and boot camp but be more than happy to visit my hon friend in aylesbury and to talk to his jobcentre and employer to see how we can provide more encouragement point of order on point of order mr speaker over the weekend see on social medium that number of labour members have the good judgment to visit the beautiful bishop auckland constituency and while be grateful to the one member who give notice of their visit that be in stark contrast to the four members the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner and the hon member for washington and sunderland west mrs hodgson for blaydon liz twist and for newcastle upon tyne north catherine do not have the good judgment to follow your advice mr speaker and notify as the sit mp have let they know of my intention to raise this issue in the chamber today could you advise the house once again on how we can ensure that member give notice of visit to another member constituency be grateful to the hon member for give notice of this point of order and inform the members concern the courtesy apply to any visit make in an official capacity know that election fever have take over but remind the house once again that as say on november and january when member intend to visit another constituency other than in private capacity they should make every reasonable effort to inform the member represent that constituency boundary change do not take effect until the next election and in the meanwhile we must observe the convention of not involve ourselves with other members constituency have have complaint from member on both side of the house please do the right thing and stick to the convention that we expect each other to follow on point of order mr speaker on thursday march during business question in response to question from the hon member for colne valley jason mccartney about council spending the leader of the house say that labour have legacy of vote rig in tower hamlets that be false claim wonder if the right hon lady get her party confused as there be widely report case in in which the election commission and richard mawrey void the mayoral election of under the representation of the people act on the ground of corrupt and illegal practice but that relate to the activity of party name tower hamlets first and have nothing to do with tower hamlets labour party or the national labour party can you offer advice mr speaker on whether and when the leader of the house can come to the house to set the record straight the leader of the house be here far to that point of order mr speaker take such matter extremely seriously and in the past when have misspoken or get fact wrong have correct the record however if be guilty of anything in our exchange last thursday it be of underplay the situation the incident that the hon lady refer to do indeed involve an independent politician although back by ken livingstone however in the year alone there be new case of corruption under the then labour mayor john biggs and the incident refer to be labour legacy because just few week ago government inspector be call in again to investigate tower hamlets fully understand it if the hon lady do not want to take my word for it so direct she to letter write to her party national executive committee in about local selection it be write on behalf of member of the local labour party it say on behalf of number of distressed member the tower hamlets labour party who have be victim of intimidation bullying harassment and blackmailing by member of john biggs campaign team some of whom be senior and leading figure of the local labour party if she look up the letter and see who be signatory to it she may be more persuade supply and appropriation anticipation and adjustments bill motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the bill be now read second time question agree to bill accordingly read second time question put forthwith that the bill be now read the third time question agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill programme no motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the follow provision shall apply to the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill for the purpose of supplement the order of december safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill programme consideration of lords amendments proceeding on consideration of lords amendments shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion at at today sit subsequent stage any further message from the lords may be consider forthwith without any question be put proceeding on the first of any further message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion two hour after their commencement proceeding on any subsequent message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their bell question agree to safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill consideration of lords amendment can confirm that none of the lords amendment engage commons financial privilege clause introduction beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lords amendment to and government motion to disagree this bill be an essential element of our wide strategy to protect our border and to stop the boat to prevent the tragic loss of life at sea cause by dangerous illegal and unnecessary crossing of the channel there be lords amendment first turn to amendment it imply that the legislation be not compliant with the rule of law but can confirm that it be do not accept that the bill undermine the rule of law and the government take our responsibility and international obligation incredibly seriously there be nothing in the bill that require any act or omission that conflict with our international obligation the minister will understand that many of we be deeply concerned that the bill undermine the good friday agreement he have tell we previously that it do not but he will also know that the irish parliament have be consider this matter indeed on february the irish prime minister admit that the irish government be concern and be follow this debate closely for the avoidance of doubt can the minister tell we when the uk government consult the irish government about this legislation and about our obligation under the good friday agreement what be the outcome of that consultation be concern with this government and this parliament as for our obligation nothing in the bill require any act or omission that conflict with our international obligation in fact this bill be base on compliance by both rwanda and the united kingdom with international law in the form of treaty that recognise and reflect the international legal obligation of both the united kingdom and rwanda at least the minister respond to our question and try to address the issue the last time ask question on this matter he try to answer it but the fact be that because of northern ireland border with the republic of ireland it have special circumstance we be reassure then about northern ireland circumstance the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy refer to the good friday agreement which be one example but there be also the matter before we can the minister confirm that the concern that the democratic unionist party put forward in our last debate on this issue have be take on board we do not see that from the legislation before we tonight and if we do not see that it will be hard for we to support the government do recall our early exchange across the chamber and the hon gentleman may know of my exchange with his hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson and the subsequent correspondence the government continue to believe that there be no incompatibility between the bill and article of the windsor framework know the hon gentleman have be concern about that but hope he be reassure by some of the detail set out in the letter must say be surprised that the government be not concerned about the clash between the bill and article of the windsor framework and the northern ireland protocol give that the high court in belfast have rule that legislation of this nature can not apply in northern ireland because it be incompatible with the obligation in article to accord with european law understand the right hon gentleman concern but repeat that there be no incompatibility between article and the bill he be right to cite the judgment but there be to be an appeal so it would not be right to debate it far at this stage the government position on this point be very clear as set out in previous exchange and also in the letter that be now in the house of commons library rwanda can not be deem safe country for refugee simply as result of unilateral declaration by the government in the face of the court and other independent organisation that have prove the contrary to be the case but let get this straight it will cost nearly million for just refugee to be send on plane to rwanda which amount to an eye water million cost per person to the public purse do the minister agree that that be precisely why this political gimmick of rwanda bill be extortionate unethical unworkable and unlawful disagree entirely with all the point that the hon gentleman have make know that he be patient and he will hear respond to each and every one like the minister have always believe that immigration should be deal with on uk rather than great britain basis for obvious reason give the comment that we have just hear do he agree that there be plenty of precedent within our own law for deem certain claim for certain citizen inadmissible that have apply to the eu and surely it be not problem to extend it far because we already have the principle that we can say claim be inherently unfounded when country be clearly safe agree entirely with my hon friend who speak with great experience and authority he will be aware of other instance in which we have legislate and continue to legislate and have deem country to be safe my right hon and learn friend be make good case for the importance of the bill and the irrelevance of the amendment offer by the other place to what we be try to achieve do he agree that when people criticise the bill on the ground of the cost of send people to rwanda they entirely miss the point that this will act as huge disincentive to people in family and community predominantly in the middle east who fundraise vast sum of money in order for their child to arrive here in the uk and not end up in east africa do he also agree that the accusation base on cost hugely underestimate the actual cost of housing current illegal immigrant in hotel across the country my hon friend be entirely right on both count will develop the point about the deterrent effect in few moment because it be point that be miss repeatedly by the labour members he be also right about the cost and the cost of not act not least the human cost of not act rise be go to make some progress now the bill be base on the compliance of both rwanda and the united kingdom with international law in the form of the treaty which itself reflect the international legal obligation of both the uk and rwanda along with other country with similar constitutional arrangement to ours we have dualist approach international law be treat as separate to domestic law and international law be incorporate into our law by parliament through legislation this bill reflect the fact that parliament be sovereign and can change domestic law as it see fit include if it be parliament judgment by require state of affair or fact to be recognise that be the central feature of the bill and many other provision be design to ensure that parliament conclusion on the safety of rwanda be accept by the domestic court the treaty set out the international legal commitment that the uk and rwandan government have make consistent with their share standard associate with asylum and refugee protection we have make it abundantly clear that we assess rwanda to be safe country and that we be confident in the government of rwanda commitment to the partnership in order successfully to offer safety and protection to those relocate under the treaty be unable to accept lords amendment as be it simply not necessary rwanda have long and proud history of support and integrate asylum seeker and refugee into the region the government of rwanda the african union and the united nations high commissioner for refugees sign an agreement to continue the operation of the emergency transit mechanism centre in rwanda which temporarily accommodate some of the most vulnerable refugee population who have face trauma detention and violence rwanda have showcase its willingness and ability to work collaboratively to provide solution to refugee situation and to crisis it be worth reflect on the policy statement and some of the evidence that have be put forward in relation to this debate and previous debate because there it be clear that the eu have announce million support package to the emergency transit mechanism the ambassador have say that it be crucial life save initiative to evacuate people to safety in rwanda it be significant example of african solidarity and of partnership with the european union the point the minister have not mention be that the european scheme be voluntary be the government intend the same sort of parameter within this scheme on the safety of rwanda the ambassador be very clear about his assessment be go to continue read the quote but there be other there be more than refugee safely in rwanda and be look after the ambassador go on to say we be grateful to the government of rwanda for host these man woman and child until such time durable solution can be find there be evidence of the safety of rwanda the minister say that he be accept the word of the rwandan foreign minister that the country be safe yet our judge in the high court of our country have decide that rwanda be not safe so be our minister say that the high judge in our land be wrong no respectfully encourage the hon lady to listen to the debate because read out the word of the eu ambassador not of any representative from rwanda that be powerful independent voice which be why cite it here in this chamber the implementation of all measure within the treaty will be expedite indeed since our previous debate on this matter the legislation require for rwanda to ratify the treaty have pass through both houses of the rwandan parliament once ratify the treaty will become law in rwanda the implementation of these provision in practice will be keep under review by the independent monitoring committee whose role be enhance by the treaty and which will ensure compliance with the obligation as agree do the minister recall that the supreme court judgment hinge on the issue of refoulement and not on whether or not refugee be safe in rwanda it might benefit some to have listen to its judgment be grateful indeed to my hon friend will turn to refoulement and non refoulement and that important issue which be exactly the basis of the supreme court judgment and how we have meet it through evidence from subsequent to the time when the supreme court be look at the fact on the ground the implementation of these provision in practice will be keep under review by the independent monitoring committee as be state clearly in clause of the bill the provision will come into force when the treaty enter into force and the treaty enter into force once the party have complete their internal procedure the bill purpose be to make it clear that rwanda be safe generally and that decision maker as well as court and tribunal must conclusively treat it as such the amendment as draft would open the door to lengthy legal challenge which will delay removal it therefore follow that can not support the amendment we be confident in the government of rwanda commitment and be clear that rwanda be safe country turn to lords amendment which be also unnecessary the government will ratify the treaty only once we agree with rwanda that all necessary implementation be in place for both country to comply with the obligation under the treaty as say the legislation for rwanda to ratify the treaty have now pass through both chambers of the rwandan parliament once ratify the treaty will become law in rwanda it therefore follow that the government of rwanda would be require to give effect to the term of the treaty in accordance with their domestic law as well as in international law in relation to the monitoring committee it be always intend that the committee be independent to ensure layer of impartial oversight over the operation of the partnership maintain that committee independence be an integral aspect of the policy design the treaty enhance the role of the previously establish independent monitoring committee and will ensure that obligation to the treaty be adhere to in practice the detail of the monitoring committee be set out in article of the treaty and it in turn will report to joint committee make up of both united kingdom and rwandan official there will be daily monitoring of the partnership for at least the first three month the enhanced period of time to ensure rapid identification and response to any shortcoming the enhanced phase will ensure that there be comprehensive monitoring and reporting and that that take place in real time the amendment risk disturb the independence and impartiality of the monitoring committee and therefore should be resist turn to lords amendment and and the issue of rwanda safety we have already touch on this but it be clear that the bill purpose be to respond to the supreme court concern and enable parliament to confirm the status of rwanda as safe third country to enable removal of those who arrive in the united kingdom illegally to the point make by my hon friend the member for torbay kevin foster it be the treaty the bill and the publish evidence pack that together demonstrate that rwanda be safe for relocate individual and that the government approach be tough but fair and lawful the government be clear that we assess rwanda to be safe and we have publish evidence to substantiate that point with reference to the point make by the hon member for torbay about the basis of the supreme court decision be sure that like the minister will have read the decision carefully do he agree that paragraph to make it clear that there be three reason for the supreme court decision it be base on evidence first about the general human right situation in rwanda secondly about the adequacy of rwanda current asylum system and thirdly about rwanda failure to meet its obligation in similar agreement regard asylum seeker with israel in will he tell what have happen since the supreme court decision to improve the general human right situation in rwanda he will be aware that the home office publish page document date january this year detail concern about human right in rwanda in fact that document support the government position because the evidence put forward be balanced the accusation from opposition party that somehow partisan evidence have be put before the chamber be completely wrong and be refute by the hon and learn lady own point she as chair of the joint committee on human rights have just be to rwanda to see for herself we have an exchange on that last week and look forward to her committee report the answer be the treaty the bill and the publish evidence pack in the bill be the conclusive presumption that rwanda be generally safe country my question be this in january this year the british government through the home office publish page document about the human right situation in rwanda detail serious concern from such august body as the us state department about the protection of human right on the ground in rwanda so what have change since the home office publish that note in january the minister have not answer that question if he can not answer it then this house can not say that rwanda be safe country the answer be that the hon and learn lady must not cherry pick her evidence the evidence must be look at in the round as say it be the treaty the bill and the publish evidence together the hon and learn lady may not have confidence in our international partner to abide by their treaty but this government do the government of rwanda will abide by their treaty will the minister give way will not give way there be conclusive presumption in the bill that rwanda be generally safe country there be series of fact reinforce by statute the court have not conclude that there be general risk to the safety of relocate individual in rwanda rather as we have repeatedly set out the treaty respond to the supreme court finding the assurance we have have since negotiate in our legally bind treaty with rwanda directly address the finding they make detailed provision for the treatment of relocate individual in rwanda ensure that they will be offer safety and protection with no risk of refoulement respectfully that respond directly to the point that be raise be the minister aware of the united nations high commissioner for refugees comment it say unhcr will build on the favourable protection environment through continue advocacy and technical support to the government of rwanda it go on to say that it be move from humanitarian approach to developmental approach so that people will be able to have the chance of livelihood and safe environment to build their life for the future be this not exactly what rwanda want to put across to people who find themselves there my hon friend prove the point just make that it be the evidence in the round that must be consider be grateful to he for draw that to parliament attention will the minister give way have give way twice to the hon and learn lady so will make progress we have be clear that the purpose of this legislation be to stop the boat and to do that we must create deterrent that go to the point of my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham will the minister give way have already give way to the hon gentleman so will make progress that show that if you enter the united kingdom illegally you will not be able to stay we can not allow systematic legal challenge to continue to frustrate and delay removal those opposition members who support this amendment do not mind if there be continue legal challenge that frustrate and delay removal but we on this side be not support the amendment it be right that the scope for individualised claim remain limited on that point about the deterrent will the minister give way no be go to move on to amendment amendment seek to enable united kingdom court and tribunal to grant interim remedy as have previously state one of the core principle of the bill be to limit the challenge that can be bring against the general safety of rwanda this amendment completely undermine the purpose of the bill and be not necessary thank the minister for give way the rwanda plan will not work as the deterrent that minister claim it will not least because it will only account for less than of all those seek to cross the channel irregularly where be the plan for the other will the minister concede that instead of fix their broken asylum system the conservatives have spend an eye water billion on this include over billion on asylum hotel and accommodation that be what be at the crux of the matter and that be what they need to resolve on deterrence which think be the thrust of the question the albania scheme bring into effect by the prime minister back in december prove the deterrent effect crossing on small boat by those from albania be down as result of that agreement that show the deterrent effect lord amendment completely undermine the purpose of the bill it be unnecessary because the bill already contain appropriate safeguard to allow decision maker and the court to consider claim of an individual person in particular circumstance if there be compelling evidence the house will know that be the chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief the people who go through the system and go to rwanda need to have their religious belief protect whether they be christians or belong to other religion or no religion my concern be that when they get to rwanda that protection may not be as strong as that which they have here can the minister give some assurance that people religious belief will have the same protection know how seriously the hon gentleman take this important issue there be policy of non discrimination in the rwandan constitution which will provide some reassurance the monitoring committee be also there on daily basis be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that point we have make it clear that we can not continue to allow relocation to rwanda to be frustrate and delay as result of systemic challenge on general safety on amendment we need strong deterrent to stop people put their life at risk by cross the channel while create that deterrent it be important that the government take decisive action also to deter adult from claim to be child my right hon and learn friend be right that it be essential that protection be in place to ensure that adult do not masquerade as child to safeguard all those concerned however he will be aware as be raise in the lords that the age assessment criterion be to be introduce in my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel and my hon friend the member for torbay kevin foster agree the criterion still have not come into effect at the border in dover and manston will the minister assist the house by explain how there can be confidence about age assessment and how it can be game if the amendment be agree note some vigorous nodding from my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel and my hon friend the member for torbay kevin foster my hon friend be right that we need to introduce scientific age assessment our european and international friend and ally do so and we must get that scheme up and run there be nothing in amendment that directly affect that or the policy so encourage she to be reassure on that point will take away her encouragement to expedite that and be grateful for her intervention because she be right my hon friend anticipate my point that assess age be inherently difficult and there be obvious safeguard risk if adult purport to be child be place in the care system it be important that we take clear step to deter adult from claim to be child and to avoid lengthy legal challenge to age assessment decision to prevent the removal of those who have be assess to be adult however the amendment would result in treat differently those who be to be remove to rwanda from those remove to another country we consider the provision in place entirely necessary to safeguard genuine child and to guard against adult who seek to game the system by purport to be child on lords amendment the house will be aware that the home office regularly publish statistic on migration level in the united kingdom it be not necessary to report the number of removal to parliament in the manner propose we do not consider an obligation to report to parliament on operational matter to be appropriate revert to the previous amendment on the fact that parliament should be give can the minister confirm the report in the paper that the home office be now seek to pay people to go to rwanda in order to fill the flight can he also confirm that if people take up that home office proposal they will be subject to exactly the same very substantial payment to the rwandan government will they also be cover by the capacity question in the treaty respectfully that be not directly relevant to amendment the answer to the question on voluntary removal be yes this will happen in exactly the same way there have be voluntary removal include last year all the way back to the dawn of time or possibly before there be nothing new the novel part be that there will be voluntary removal to rwanda that be absolutely right specifically in relation to amendment it be not necessary to report the number of removal to parliament and we do not consider obligation to report to parliament to be appropriate will the minister give way be go to continue amendment would act to impede provision already recently pass in the nationality and borders act and the illegal migration act the amendment be unnecessary it be important to be clear that the government of rwanda have system in place to safeguard relocate individual with range of vulnerability include those concern mental health and gender base violence furthermore under article of the treaty rwanda must have regard to information provide about relocate individual relate to any specific need that might arise as result of their be victim of modern slavery or human trafficking and must take all necessary step to ensure that those need be accommodate in relation to amendment the government greatly value the contribution of those who have support we and our armed force overseas that be why there be legal route for they to come to the united kingdom it remain the government priority to deter people from make dangerous and unnecessary journey to the united kingdom anyone who arrive here illegally should not be able to make the united kingdom their home and eventually settle here person who choose to come here illegally particularly if they have safe and legal route available to they should be liable for removal to safe country the minister seem to try to brush over some of the cost involve be he aware that virgin galactic can send six people into space for less than this government want to spend send one person to rwanda be it not time to rethink this absurd policy and its extortionate cost we have debate on thursday on the cost of the scheme and not single labour back bencher be there there be only the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson who propose the debate and the shadow minister of course do not treat the right hon lady as an ordinary back bencher because she be the chair of the home affairs select committee it be her debate and not single other labour back bencher be there that show the lack of priority that labour members give to this matter in relation to amendment section of the illegal migration act pass last year enable the secretary of state by regulation to specify category of person to whom the duty to remove be not to apply whether temporarily or permanently for those who be not in scope of the ima the home secretary have discretion to consider case on case by case basis where circumstance demand it want to reassure parliament that once the uk special force and afghan relocation and assistance policy review have conclude the government will consider and revisit how the ima and removal under exist immigration legislation will apply to those who be determined to be eligible as result of the review ensure that those people receive the attention that they deserve the government recognise the commitment and the responsibility that come with combat veteran whether our own or those who show courage by serve alongside we and we will not let they down the bill and the legally bind treaty will make it clear that rwanda be safe country to which we can swiftly remove those who enter the united kingdom illegally it address the factual concern identify by the supreme court it provide for clear detailed and bind obligation in international law on both party it will prevent systematic legal challenge about the safety of rwanda from frustrating and delay removal as my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham set out it provide strong deterrent and clear message to illegal migrant and criminal gang that if people come to this country by unlawful mean they will not be able to stay call the shadow minister rise to speak in favour of all of the lords amendment that be before we today they each serve to make this shambolic mess of bill marginally less absurd and as will come to in second they would serve only to put in statute what ministers have promise from the dispatch box not one of the amendment be design to prevent the departure of flight to rwanda as the prime minister have repeatedly and wrongly imply we all want to end the tory small boat chaos and be proud that the labour party have consistently put forward smart pragmatic and sensible plan to do so start by go after the criminal smuggler gang at source through new cross border police unit and new security partnership with europol however this bill and the treaty that accompany it will not contribute in any way to achieve that aim since we have see gang disrupt and more than people arrest because of the action of this government be keen to understand labour idea about smash the gang how much more would that cost and what would it look like as total percentage of number we will eradicate the activity of the criminal smuggler gang by have proper security partnership with our european partner and ally remind the hon gentleman that his party have spend the last eight year trash and destroy our relationship with our european partner and ally what we would have with labour government be basis of trust to get the result that we need to see for the british people that be what sovereignty be all about the entire rwanda debacle have absorb vast amount of time energy and money that should instead have be focus on take back control of our border security from the criminal gang who trade in human misery let we not forget that more than asylum seeker have cross in small boat since with arrive on this prime minister watch alone the chaos must end and this government be clearly unable to restore order at the border so it be time for they to get out of the way so that labour can get the job do before get into the substance of the amendment would like to pay tribute to the noble member of the other place who table they in so do they be fulfil their constitutional democratic and patriotic duty by scrutinise and seek to amend the bill just as they would with any other piece of legislation that come before they they have not be intimidate or sidetrack by the prime minister mistaken assertion that the bill should have some kind of special status or treatment which would somehow allow ministers to railroad it through parliament and to drive coach and horse through britain long stand democratic convention indeed this profoundly dismissive attitude have manifest itself in the way in which the government have point blank refuse to engage with the lords amendment they have reject every one of they rather than seek to use they and see they as basis for negotiation and compromise on amendment be the hon gentleman aware that the constitution committee of the house of lords which have significant number of member of the other place have explicitly state that it be clear and unambiguous in the word use in the statute that international law give way to the supremacy and sovereignty of the united kingdom parliament the committee say that in paragraph of its report which be publish only last year would remind the hon gentleman that the supreme court the high court of our land have rule unanimously and in no uncertain term that rwanda be not safe country to which to send asylum seeker know that he be very take with parliamentary sovereignty and that be very important but parliamentary sovereignty must be base on have due regard to the finding of our judiciary it be to be exercise with caution and moderation which be why it be so important that our colleague in the other place have play their role will the hon gentleman give way will give way one more time be extremely grateful because this question go right to the heart of the matter paragraph of the rwanda judgment itself be unequivocal the president of the supreme court rule to dismiss one of the case that of asm an iraqi on very specific ground he say that the consequence of the sovereignty of parliament with respect to the legislation the immigration act and the retained eu law revocation and reform act be that the court have to dismiss his claim the supremacy of parliament prevail in that judgment for the very reason have just give as set out in paragraph under the principle of legality thank the hon gentleman for his intervention but at the end of the day we can not legislate to turn dog into cat we can not legislate for the sky to be green and the grass to be blue that be basic tenet of the respect with which our institution should be treat and put this kind of absurd legislation before we be frankly turn our institution into laugh stock respectfully suggest that the hon gentleman keep that in mind let we be clear the only special or unique status that can be find in the rwanda bill and the treaty that accompany it be in its extortionate implementation cost its unlawful nature and its glaring unworkability indeed as turn to address the detail of the amendment it be important to point out that since the bill be last debate in this place even more evidence of the astonishing unaffordability of the scheme have come to light this fail scheme be already cost the british taxpayer almost million even though not single asylum seeker have be send to rwanda but every new detail be more astounding than the last we recently learn that the first asylum seeker to be send to rwanda would cost the british taxpayer an extra million earn an invoice of million from the rwandan government for just of the asylum seeker who cross in small boat last year that be almost million per asylum seeker let that sink in for million to send just one asylum seeker from the uk to rwanda and then another per person on top of that in comparison process an asylum seeker in the uk cost just my hon friend will be aware of the thousand of asylum seeker who be be disperse up and down the country with very little support give to local service while the government be obsess over gimmick they be not deal with the real problem in local community and support those community to host the people they be disperse up and down the country this crisis continue and the government need to get grip on it my hon friend be absolutely right that the smoke and mirror that have be use about clear the backlog lot of administrative withdrawal and other way of just get people out of the backlog be be combine with shorten the eviction period which be lead to staggering increase in homelessness among those who have be grant asylum what be happen be frankly stain on the conscience of our country total lack of co ordination between the home office the department for levelling up housing and communities and our colleague in local authority be leave those local authority high and dry although the hon gentleman and might not share many view on this bill do he share my surprise that the government have refuse to accept lords amendment which would require they to report on this bill success as the government do not want the number of removal to be report to parliament do he suspect that they know this bill will not be as effective as they think thank the right hon gentleman for his excellent question sometimes the mask slip in the government response to amendment perhaps they have decide very disrespectfully to refuse to engage on any of the lords amendment because exactly as he say they worry that lift the lid on this box might show total failure inside the shadow minister be make an excellent speech let we not forget the history the tories rwanda bill be the third new law on channel crossing in just three year the first law have be partly suspend because it have so many problem and actually make thing bad and the second bill have still not be fully enact this third bill be another gimmick cost the public purse million person do my hon friend agree that rather than constantly chase gimmick and try to dupe the british public the government finally need to get grip on the situation agree with every word my hon friend say just imagine if the amount of time money resource energy and political capital burn on this hare brain rwanda scheme have be use to do thing that might actually deliver and just imagine if the government have listen to labour plan for deliver the change we need to see we might have make some progress and see thing work by the way we support what the government have do with albania why do we not see more of that rather than this utterly ridiculous government by gimmick what waste of time and money the level of waste and this government cavalier attitude to taxpayer money be utterly staggering where oh where be the plan for the remain of case that the government say will be inadmissible ten of thousand of people who be now ineligible to be process and ineligible to claim asylum can not be send to rwanda either that backlog the so call perma backlog currently stand at people with most of they live in one of more than taxpayer fund hotel across the country cost million of pound every single day my hon friend be make very powerful argument against this government wasteful policy be he aware that the million cost of send each person to rwanda would cover new police officer or new nurse in my constituency to fix the horrendous backlog create by this shambolic government my hon friend have do his math on the million particularly enjoy his analogy with the virgin galactic spacecraft which show that the rwanda plan be galactically wasteful policy he be right that so much of this be about choice and priority and the government choice and priority be simply wrong in waste valuable taxpayer money that would be much well focus elsewhere that be why we support lords amendment labour front bench amendment in the name of my noble friend lord coaker the amendment would require the government to report on the timetable for remove inadmissible asylum seeker under the illegal migration act we need to see accountability on the inadmissibility provision that have create the perma backlog of small boat asylum seeker who be stick in limbo and be unable to be process if of the people cross in small boat be not likely to be send to rwanda perhaps the minister can tell we what will happen to they will he admit that despite all his bluff and bluster they will simply be let into our asylum system after all no the premise of inadmissibility be always that it be one way street to limbo and shamble as my right hon friend the member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper the shadow home secretary and have continually warn ministers in this chamber over the past two year of course there be an alternative hope that conservative members have be listen because for the past month my right hon friend and have be absolutely clear from this dispatch box how labour will prevent the dangerous and life threaten channel crossing and how we will fix our broken asylum system have already mention how we would redirect the money set aside for the rwandan government into cross border police unit an intelligence share security partnership with europol in order to smash the criminal smuggling gang upstream as part of our plan we would also ensure that people who have no right to be here be remove to safe third country since under the tories removal have collapse the return of foreign national offender have fall by and the return of fail asylum seeker have fall by under labour plan new return and enforcement unit would include additional official to expedite removal with million set aside to create new nightingale court to fast track appeal and pursue tough action on employer who employ migrant illegally thank the shadow minister for give way he say he want removal to safe third country which one be very sorry but would the hon member mind repeat that it be always good to listen to an intervention but will repeat it for he he say that one part of his plan be to remove people to safe third country simply question if not rwanda which one apologise should have say home country would like to correct the record it be home country apology mis speak labour common sense pragmatic plan will smash the business model of the criminal gang deter dangerous journey and tackle the backlog with your permission mr speaker will now run through the remain nine amendment from the other place we support each of they for the reason will now set out how much would labour plan cost as have already say do not know if the hon member be listen this be about repurpose the vast quantity of taxpayer money that be be squander on the hare brain rwanda plan the re channelling of that money will fund the clearance of the backlog sort out return and smash the criminal gang would first like to focus on lords amendment table by the noble lord browne which seek to exempt individual who have work in support of the uk government or armed force from removal to rwanda under the provision of the bill the amendment be drive by moral imperative we owe debt of gratitude to those who have support our defence diplomacy and development abroad not least in afghanistan it beggar belief that the government would even consider send this cohort of hero who be flee the taliban to rwanda britain commitment towards these loyal to britain afghans be of course feel most strongly by our own armed force but the government have continually shirk their responsibility towards afghans include by leave thousand who have right to be in the uk strand in pakistan for more than year it be little wonder that they have resort to make desperate journey across the channel operation warm welcome have become operation cold shoulder the hon gentleman say that he want more afghan people to come from pakistan to the uk how many more immigrant do he want to come to the uk from afghanistan the amendment be about stop they be send to rwanda but let we be absolutely clear there be many many afghans identify by the government under the afghan relocation and assistance policy and the afghan citizen resettlement scheme who be languish in pakistan we remember the prime minister memo to whitehall say by the way everybody let slow peddle on these afghans who be in pakistan and have be identify for resettlement under the acr and arap if the hon member want to know the number recommend that he go to his own government and ask how many have be identify under arap and acr in my constituency have meet one family in similar situation the constituent husband have be kill in afghanistan but the family be still in limbo because of the delay in decision making be my hon friend aware that pakistan be now force afghan asylum seeker back to afghanistan there be ten of thousand of people in that situation some of whom work to support our force during the war in afghanistan my hon friend be absolutely right the scope of lords amendment be specifically for those who serve shoulder to shoulder with our armed force and in our diplomatic and development effort in afghanistan these be people to whom the united kingdom owe debt of honour and debt of gratitude be not sure whether honour be word that we can apply very easily to those on the conservative benches but that be what this be about lord amendment in the name of the noble baroness butler sloss be also base on moral imperative as it would prevent the removal of potential victim of modern slavery to rwanda until they receive decision from the government on whether there be credible evidence that the person be modern slavery victim it really should go without say that modern slavery victim should not be send to rwanda but sadly with this government basic moral decency be scarce commodity let speak to lords amendment and those of we who have deal with trafficked victim and those who serve we in afghanistan feel that there be some loss of moral compass somewhere those who serve we in afghanistan in whole range of different function have only just survive get out of the country they have be chase by the taliban and their family have be harass some of they get to pakistan and be then threaten with force back over the border again they have get to we traumatise and we be go to traumatise they again by send they to rwanda that can not be right can not believe that any hon member who have deal with such case could not support these amendment because it be human suffering in the extreme and for those who have serve we it be human suffering bring about by their loyalty to we thank my right hon friend for that intervention he make the case with passion and conviction know that he have number of asylum seeker and refugee in his constituency and he do huge amount of work on their behalf he be absolutely right there be some issue that should really transcend the day to day political consideration that we have in this place because they be issue that be base on moral imperative it be deeply disappointing that in lords amendment and the government have refuse even to use they as the basis for negotiation or some kind of compromise we find that deeply disappointing with regard to the early question of how many do the hon member not agree that the simple answer be all those who serve and who risk their life to help we in war that require the support of the local population we have record of the help and support they give surely we can not turn our back on those people if they be in danger thank the right hon gentleman for what he have say what contrast there be between his intervention and that of the hon member for rother valley alexander stafford from the conservative benches genuinely believe that when the hon member for rother valley reflect he will regret make his intervention and perhaps reflect on what the right hon gentleman have just say we on the opposition benches be profoundly concerned about unaccompanied child be inadvertently send to rwanda for this reason we support lords amendment in the name of the noble baroness lister which reverse change to age assessment procedure establish by the illegal migration act in relation specifically to removal to rwanda it restore the ability of domestic court and tribunal to fully consider suspensive judicial review claim regard removal decision take on the basis of age assessment of unaccompanied child lord amendment to all relate to the rule of law we support all of those amendment and they be all principle with which government ministers have say they agree indeed the simple question that should be ask in relation to each one of these amendment be this if minister believe that rwanda be safe country then why be the government refuse to support these amendment they say that the bill abide by international law so why not make that clear in the bill they say that rwanda be safe country and be meet its obligation so let we see the evidence and agree trust but verify mechanism in that spirit lords amendment be labour front bench amendment that place responsibility on the government to comply in full with their current obligation under domestic and international law do the hon gentleman not accept that amendment be entirely otiose in term of compliance with domestic law the bill when enact will be an element of domestic law in term of compliance with international law be it not the case that the bill be predicate on international law that be to say the rwanda treaty if that be the case why will ministers not accept the amendment those in the other place who have great deal more constitutional expertise than have be simply seek reassurance that our democratic convention and obligation in relation to alignment with the rule of law will be respect if that be the case as the right hon gentleman suggest surely the amendment should be perfectly acceptable to the government perhaps can help to shed light on this the minister have just show that the government be not abide by their international obligation the good friday agreement explicitly commit we to work together those word be in it with the irish government when it come to the right of individual in northern ireland the bill will deny right to individual in northern ireland yet the minister admit that the government have not even consult the irish government do my hon friend agree that our word be our bond as country and if we show that we can not be trust to stand up for international law it be right that this place demand that the government put it in the bill agree with my hon friend who make very clear case lot of rhetoric have accompany the bill around the european convention on human right and the united kingdom obligation under international law the implication of that for the good friday agreement be truly chilling the way in which government members be prepared to sabre rattle and to use rhetoric in way that undermine our reliability as partner that can be trust to respect our international legal obligation be frankly shameful and deeply concern not least in the case of the good friday agreement lord amendment and in the name of the noble lord hope state that rwanda may be consider safe country only if and when the measure set out in the rwanda treaty have be fully implement and the monitoring committee have establish that that be the case the government claim that the measure in the treaty address concern in the supreme court recent ruling so there be absolutely no reason why ministers should refuse to accept lord hope amendment lord amendment and in the name of the noble lord anderson state that rwanda can be consider safe country unless there be credible evidence to the contrary as determine by court or tribunal follow the supreme court ruling the government themselves accept that the situation in rwanda be not static but evolve as it be in every country on the face of the earth if the government accept that rwanda could one day become safe for asylum seeker who be send there from the uk they must by definition accept that it could one day deteriorate lord anderson amendment simply provide basis for assess the situation on the ground in rwanda and act accordingly joint statement sign by over civil society organisation have brand the bill constitutionally extraordinary and deeply harmful piece of legislation it threaten the universality of human right and be likely in breach of international law strike serious blow to the uk commitment to the rule of law do my hon friend agree that the bill represent an unethical gimmick that will potentially put very vulnerable people at risk and harm the uk reputation on the world stage my hon friend be absolutely right if the amount of time and energy that have be waste on this madcap bill which be also constitutional outrage unaffordable unlawful and unworkable have be put into address some of the challenge that we face in pragmatic way just think where we could have get to by today finally lords amendment in the name of the noble baroness chakrabarti allow government ministers official and court to consider whether rwanda be safe on case by case basis give that the government have accept that some appeal will be allow we see no reason for they to reject that amendment after year of incompetent and negligent governance our asylum system be in mess the conservatives have preside over backlog of asylum seeker despite ministers attempt to pull the wool over the public eye through administrative withdrawal and various other rus there be still asylum seeker in taxpayer fund hotel contribute to an asylum system that now cost time what it do under labour at an eyewatering billion only last week we discover that there be major problem with broken immigration it system which have mix up detail of applicant affect staggering people however this con of bill be not the way to fix the problem that the conservative government have create the high court in our land have rule unanimously that rwanda be not safe country and no amount of ludicrous legislation such as this bill can change that fact the government may well wish to say that the sky be green and the grass be blue but introduce an act of parliament will never make it so even conservative members recognise that the bill be on hiding to nothing indeed former home secretary have state that it be highly unlikely to work and the former immigration minister the right hon member for newark robert jenrick have describe the government aim as be to get few symbolic half fill flight take off this spring rather than plan that be genuine attempt to tackle the dangerous channel crossing it be probably no surprise then that minister be finally turn to plan pay people report per head to go to rwanda instead can that really be true and if so will the minister take the opportunity to enlighten the house on some of the detail would that per head come on top of the million cost that we already know about will there be another treaty between the uk and rwanda to implement it and if so will he publish it have the national audit office do an assessment of those additional cost will the house be able to vote on the new plan that have be brief await the minister response with interest this bill be con the treaty be con the whole rwanda plan be con it be quite simply headline chasing gimmick as unworkable as it be unaffordable the country know it this house know it the home secretary know it and the minister know it at million per head the rwanda scheme be the bad value for money policy in history however the amendment that have speak to today will not stop flight take off we expect those flight to happen this spring as the prime minister have repeatedly promise the country the amendment would simply insert into the bill what minister have promise so encourage member on both side of the house to join in the division lobby later to support they rise order the government and opposition front benchers have perhaps understandably take certain amount of leeway in broad brush approach to the debate before we proceed remind back benchers that we be now debate lords amendment this be not second reading debate call sir jeremy wright thank you very much indeed mr deputy speaker may begin with an apology to you and other for the fact that will not be in the chamber for some part of the debate because of other parliamentary business that have to attend start my remark by recall that the fundamental purpose of the bill be to locate with parliament rather than with decision maker in individual case or with court review those case the decision on whether rwanda be safe country to send people to number of the amendment before we would undermine that fundamental purpose by transfer decision on that question away from parliament and back to the caseworker and court so they be be afraid wreck amendment they be incredibly elegant wreck amendment and they come from an honourable and fundamental opposition to the purpose of the bill an opposition that entirely understand confess that do not find voting for this legislation comfortable choice it come very close to the line on rule of law acceptability but in my view stay just the right side of it crucially it assert parliamentary sovereignty on an issue of huge political significance where that issue be central to the delivery of key government policy that significant and central issue be whether the government of the day be entitle to pursue policy on illegal immigration that contain an element of effective deterrence and think the government must be able to do that for deterrent to be effective it must be clear to economic migrant seek to reach the uk under cover of our asylum system the deterrent be that they might end up in different country in this case rwanda for that deterrent to be meaningful the prospect of transfer to rwanda must be real one that it be not easy to evade which mean that the headline judgment on rwanda safety must be clear to all subject of course as it should be only to persuasive individual circumstance think that approach be worthy of support for two reason first illegal migration be huge problem and the government must be able to pursue innovative solution to it especially in the absence of credible alternative my right hon and learn friend be make an excellent point about how we must be innovative be that not the reason why other country be look at what the uk be do the like of austria germany and italy have all talk about use third nation because there need to be solution to the problem as he be so eloquently set out be conscious mr deputy speaker not to transgress into second read territory but think my hon friend be right about that as our right hon and learn friend the minister have point out other international agency also make use of rwanda for these purpose secondly parliament be as able as any other body to make judgment about the safety of rwanda be grateful for the information with which we have be provide include the country information note that be refer to early in the debate which in my view support the conclusion that rwanda be safe for the purpose of the bill but parliament decision making on the safety of rwanda must have integrity not just for now but for the future be have to say trouble by what might describe as the absolutist if not the eternalist nature of the wording of the bill which say that rwanda be safe and must be take as such for variety of purpose and parliament judgment on that will stand as far as can see until new legislation be pass that be why the noble lord hope amendment lords amendment and be interesting although can not support they as they essentially transfer authority to the treaty monitor committee to determine whether rwanda remain safe country base on compliance or otherwise with the treaty that can not be right as the bill be intend specifically to give parliament that authority and parliament should in theory at least retain the option to consider breach of the treaty and nevertheless conclude that rwanda remain safe country for the purpose of the bill my right hon and learn friend make very powerful point with which have much sympathy between now and future stage of the bill could the government not think about how they can reconcile that with the legitimate concern express in lord hope amendment which think be fair and honest fact change and if parliament set itself up as an arbiter and decider on fact it must have means of change its decision if the fact change just as anything else would say to the minister that keynes come to mind can we find way forward my hon and learn friend anticipate my conclusion and agree with he entirely in fact he agree with entirely in advance in light of what my right hon and learn friend say how do he see parliament role in assess any future breach of the treaty essentially lords amendment and flawed as they be raise the valid issue of what happen if rwanda at any point fall below the standard expect of it to justify its safe country status the bill would establish in legislation the largely unchallengeable conclusion that rwanda be safe country for the purpose of the bill because parliament say so without any mechanism for parliament to say differently if the fact change save presumably for fresh primary legislation see two contradiction almost in what the right hon and learn gentleman be say he talk about the sovereignty of parliament and whether rwanda be designate as safe can be change but our supreme court the high court in the land say after read all the evidence that rwanda be not safe yes parliament be sovereign but it have become almost dictatorship because this be bit like say person be find guilty in criminal court but because we in parliament do not like that that person must be return to court and be sentence that use parliamentary sovereignty in most nonsensical way be afraid do not accept what the hon lady say first as the minister make clear the government have not ignore the conclusion of the supreme court which we must remind ourselves be make in they have respond to those concern and new information be now available for parliament to consider my point be that this be on the government invitation for parliament to decide it be for parliament to determine whether we consider that rwanda be on the evidence available to we safe country we may all reach different conclusion about that but the premise of this legislation be that take into account the concern the supreme court have express it be none the less for parliament to determine whether rwanda be safe country for the purpose of the legislation but it be simply not sensible for parliament not to be able to say differently save through primary legislation if the fact be to change we all hope perhaps expect that rwanda will remain safe place for migrant to go but if we could guarantee that indefinitely we would not need the treaty the government work so hard to secure or the monitoring committee design to scrutinise compliance with it although the government be entitle to reject the amendment they should give some thought to the situation of the bill because it break new ground by give parliament specific authority over judgment that will bind many but that parliament can not easily revise even if it come to believe that revision be necessary the treaty and the monitoring of its term provide mechanism for parliament to be alert to significant change in compliance and ask my right hon and learn friend the minister and his colleague in the other place to consider how parliament might be give further scope to engage with that judgment if the need arise do appreciate that the government retain mean by which they can revise their judgment of the safety of rwanda but the bill clearly and deliberately transfer the judgment on safety to parliament if it be judgment in parliament name it must be right for parliament to retain the capacity to reconsider and if necessary revise it it remain the position of the scottish national party that this be an irredeemably awful bill we do not support the rwanda plan we think it be both an offence to humanity and an egregious waste of public money particularly at time when many of our constituent be struggle to feed themselves thank the lords for their work on the bill and for at least try to make it in some way well and we would support all the lords amendment and what they attempt to do with the bill lord coaker lords amendment would add measure to comply with domestic and international law that should be basic any legislation in this place should abide by domestic and international law it seem ludicrous that we have bill before we that do not abide by international and domestic law it be bit of cheek for the minister to talk about rwanda abide by treaty and its loyalty while at the same time the tories go about the business of undermine the uk own international commitment in international agreement that we help to draft the european convention on human right the refugee convention the international covenant on civil and political right and the council of europe convention on action against trafficking in human being as well as customary international law and domestic law be all thing we have create here that the government have set about undermine it be absolutely ludicrous it bring into question the government commitment to international agreement and particularly the european convention on human right which underpin so much we have hear from member about the significance of some of the legislation to the good friday agreement and scotland devolution settlement the government see fit to undermine all that through their action be sure that my hon friend will have read the report of the joint committee on human rights on the bill we note that other nation may be influence by how the uk treat its international treaty obligation in particular we notice that the prime minister of pakistan have refer to the uk rwanda policy in defence of his country decision to expel from pakistan hundred of afghans who have flee from the taliban regime do my hon friend agree that it be most regrettable that he can refer to the uk cavalier attitude towards international law in support of his own cavalier attitude absolutely agree other country around the world have look to the uk as an upholder of right as beacon of democracy and human right but follow this tawdry bill we can see other country look at the uk dissent from international norm that we set up will the hon lady give way will make little progress because be mindful of what mr deputy speaker say about time want to touch on the misinformation that the minister put forward about rwanda and the united nations high commissioner for refugees the transit agreement be not the same at all as people be permanently relocate to rwanda the unhcr have mention that norway sweden canada france belgium the netherlands finland and the usa have take people from the transit camp people have come from country include sudan and cameroon to libya and to the transit camp in rwanda and then be be move on elsewhere they be not stay in rwanda permanently indeed report from the transit camp have highlight that people have no desire to stay in rwanda in transit camp because of the condition in which they be live so the government be not at all talk about the same thing there they should be absolutely clear on that and not mislead the house with point that suit their argument lord amendment in the name of lord hope of craighead would ensure that rwanda could be designate as safe only if the treaty be adhere to it state that rwanda will be safe country when and so long as the arrangement provide for in the rwanda treaty have be fully implement and be be adhere to in practice among the supreme court concern about the matter be the fact that rwanda be not yet in place where it can adhere to all those arrangement in practice perhaps it will in future but it be not safe now to declare it completely safe in all circumstance right now be false argument lord amendment would create an obligation on the government to report to parliament on the term of the treaty and how those be be monitor that be perfectly reasonable what be the government afraid of after all if they think rwanda be safe and fine why do they not want scrutiny of the situation it need monitoring there be continue report of what the rwandan back rebel be do on rwanda border this legislation be poor way of gauge safety it be not flexible or reasonable and can not take account of change circumstance circumstance can change rapidly and unexpectedly but we be legislate to say that rwanda be safe in all circumstance in perpetuity that be clearly ludicrous and give hostage to fortune the government should be aware of that the hon lady make the point that thing change with time do she accept that many measure have be put in place by the uk government and the rwandan government since the judgment of the uk supreme court last year it be difficult to tell because scrutiny mechanism be not in place that would allow committees of this house to ascertain whether that be entirely the case the committee that my hon and learn friend the member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry be on have be to visit rwanda and she have information about that visit that she hop to share with the house understand that the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson be on that trip too but that be not good enough there need to be far continue scrutiny and it be important that parliament have the opportunity for that know from the chair of the home affairs committee the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson that even information on the deal have be difficult to come by last week in the chamber we discuss the obfuscation and secrecy surround the cost of the plan if this be how the government be begin this journey we can have no confidence on this side of the house certainly that they can be trust which be why lords amendment be so important the house need scrutiny mechanism will the hon lady give way be conscious of what you say about time mr deputy speaker and should like to make some progress in lords amendment lord anderson of ipswich propose to add to the word every decision maker must conclusively treat the republic of rwanda as safe country the word unless present with credible evidence to the contrary agree that evidence be important if judge and other decision maker be not allow to make decision on the basis of evidence rather than rely on bit of legislation draw up in short period the government have zero credibility they be ask people to blindfold themselves to any other circumstance and not to heed any evidence or proof there must be an opportunity for every decision maker to treat the evidence with the due diligence that we would all expect lord amendment would remove the part of the bill that state that rwanda should automatically be consider safe country it provide rebuttal mechanism for the assertion of safety in rwanda liberty say that the amendment correct deficiency in the bill whereby parliament be ask to state that rwanda be and will continue to be safe and there be no mechanism by which this can be revisit this be moderate safeguard if the government think about this fully they would surely conclude that the amendment would enhance the bill but they be of course reject all amendment regardless of their source lord amendment effectively restore the power of the court to make factual judgment on the safety of rwanda in an individual case or for group of people who share characteristic such as lgbtq people think it tell that the minister say that it completely undermine the purpose of the bill well good be all can say in response we should be try to undermine the purpose of the bill if its aim be for example to ship lgbtq people off to country that may not welcome they in all circumstance without allow they to check the position first think it perfectly reasonable to provide the ability to make judgment of this kind recall that at the back of the illegal migration act be list of country with exemption for particular group of people in some case specify man or woman but the bill do not even do that think it entirely reasonable for there to be some way of question this power in the bill lord amendment table by baroness lister concern issue relate to the age of unaccompanied child which consider to be of the utmost importance the treaty make provision for what happen if child somehow mysteriously end up in rwanda by mistake but that only happen if the home office have make an error of some kind in send the child there in the first place we know from medical professional that some of the age assessment be effectively pseudo science we know that when child have come here have cross sea continent and war zone in very difficult circumstance it may be more difficult to assess their age because they have have much tough paper round than my son for example we also know that not all child look exactly the same or present themselves in exactly the same way although they may be the same age we can all remember that when we be at school there be always some great big guy with beard and hairy chest when the other be knee high to buttercup not at my convent school that be another question suppose the point be that everyone be different we can not reliably look at someone and tell their age the bill should contain more protection to ensure that child who have already go through incredibly traumatic experience be not send to rwanda will the hon lady give way as have say be conscious of what we have be tell about time be sure that if the hon lady want to make speech on this subject later we will all listen to it lord amendment add mechanism for report to parliament under the heading removal to rwanda under the illegal migration act it state within day of the day on which this act be pass the secretary of state must lay before parliament statement again that be an important scrutiny mechanism we in this parliament should know who be be send to rwanda and the timetable for those removal as this lords amendment suggest most importantly propose new paragraph in amendment deal with the arrangement in place for people not send to rwanda we know that only the tiny percentage of people who end up here will be send to rwanda it be entirely unrealistic to suggest that more than few hundred people will ever get send there so we need to know what happen to the people who end up in immigration limbo those who be inadmissible where be they who look after they where do they live how do they survive what do they eat we need to know what happen to the people this government be commit to immigration limbo it be important and the government should update parliament on it the minister talk about publish immigration statistic but think we need more than that this house need to hold the government accountable for the people they send to rwanda and the people they do not send there the point about the timetable of removal be also important because be aware of people in dungavel who be keen to leave the uk yet the uk government be take an age to arrange the mechanism for they to do so even when people want and have reason to go somewhere else the government be not facilitate that worryingly the minister say it be not necessary to report on that to parliament disagree it be entirely important and necessary to report on that to parliament so that we can hold the government accountable again if they think that this will go so well surely they will want to tell we how many people they have send away rather than about those they have not lords amendment be about victim of modern slavery and human trafficking be remove without their consent that be deep concern for many organisation who support people who have be traffic and have be through absolute hell it be important that those people be not remove to rwanda without their consent redress have provide briefing about torture in rwanda and it highlight that there have be case of it human rights watch report on rwanda publish in and all include example of torture there be list in the redress briefing that urge all member to have look at although will not detain the house with it now the briefing highlight that in the supreme court case it be point out that evidence of human right violation raise serious question as to its compliance with rwanda international obligation since this have occur despite the country have ratify many international human right agreement furthermore the british medical association briefing raise concern about the ability of rwanda to support those who have be victim of torture rwanda be on the list of country experience healthcare worker crisis it be on the list of country that the uk be not suppose to recruit from again that call into question whether people can be support when they go to rwanda the bma briefing state medical review of people under threat of removal to rwanda reveal that display medical indicator of have be torture with have symptom or diagnosis of ptsd and have experience suicidal thought while in detention we be talk about an incredibly vulnerable group and they deserve specific support it be important that we recognise that lords amendment should stay in the bill come to lords amendment in which lord browne of ladyton propose change to protect supporter of the uk armed force and their family from removal to rwanda that be significant amendment particularly in the context of afghanistan have talk many time in this house about afghans such as the triples who support the uk endeavour in afghanistan and have be despicably leave behind continue to get regular email from woman who be train by uk force and work alongside they in afghanistan she be increasingly frustrated and terrify but most of all she be despondent that the uk have let she down and have not keep the promise that she feel she have be make on the hon lady point about the uk let down people who be work for we and with we that be all because of this gimmicky legislation which be design to appeal to certain percentage of voter from government who be bankrupt of any real idea for tackle the real issue of concern in our country this legislation be just gimmick the hon lady be correct it be gimmick it have no basis in fact and there lot of doubt about whether it will even work but it appeal to certain section that the government think need to be appeal to it be not so much dog whistle as foghorn but it be definitely there to continue with the point about afghans the migration observatory at oxford university have point out that more afghans have come by small boat than in any of the uk scheme in fact between january and june last year nine time as many afghans arrive by small boat as under the route that the government specifically set up the arap and acr be fail to deal with this issue they be suppose to be safe and legal route that prevent and dissuade people from get in small boat but they do not work they take too long they be inefficient and they do not provide the security that people require to come here so people take thing into their own hand who can blame they in the circumstance have see far too many case in my constituency when afghanistan fall we have about people in touch who have relative in afghanistan but know of only handful who manage to get their family over here that be despicable worry about those people all the time do not know where they be and do not know whether even their family know where they be it be tell that so many people will come by small boat because they can not rely on uk government scheme to get they here safely the bill be full of contradiction it be deterrent but rwanda be also safe it undermine our own obligation internationally and our domestic court while tell rwanda that it must keep to its obligation it be not tough enough for the far right of the tory party but too harsh for the more reasonable wing it be circus it be deflection from break home office that can not even get the basic right that be beset by delay under investigation by the information commissioner office and waste money hand over fist the rwanda bill be not scotland value in scotland we see the humanity in people an alternative be set out clearly in the scottish government paper on the issue we can not trust the fail westminster party to dismantle the hostile environment that they create scotland must have these power urgently we must have independence to play our part in the world sign the government motion to reject lords amendment and be happy to support they in it the fact be that the lords amendment would add to clause the word full compliance with domestic and international law the problem be that that would make the clause one of the most serious and dangerous clause have see in recent statutory history it would contradict one of the most fundamental principle of our constitutional law as my right hon and learn friend the minister for counter illegal migration say we have dualist system have refer to it several time in the past and it be fundamental that be unlike germany as article of its constitution state that international law be the most fundamental part of its constitutional arrangement article and of the dutch constitution contain similar provision we have dualist system and the sovereignty of our parliament be imperative over many generation in fact go back century all the court case whether in the house of lords or in the supreme court make it absolutely clear that where word use in statute be clear and unambiguous and where parliament explicit intention be clear parliamentary sovereignty mean that the supremacy of parliament can override international law and should do so the should do so be equally important indeed would go far and say that in our court sovereignty with those clear and unambiguous word trump international law as mention in an intervention on the labour spokesman the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock the house of lords constitution committee include the like of the noble lord falconer lord robertson and various other clearly state in paragraph of its report last year on the rule of law parliamentary sovereignty mean that parliament can legislate contrary to the uk obligation under international law that fundamentally disagree with what be contain in lords amendment so what if may say the heck be go on the lords have very important decision to take and paragraph to of that report contain the very carefully detailed reasoning that lead the committee to the conclusion have just read out have mention in previous debate the judgment of lord hoffmann in case call lyons want to quote from it because he clearly say that international law be trump by the supremacy of the sovereignty of parliament parliament have to be the key determinant what he say be so important would not bother make my point in this way if it be not for this amendment be not sure whether the leader of the opposition really intend to achieve the objective set out in clause it worry very much indeed if he be complicit in this operation this be labour amendment and have majority of in the house of lords so we be go to have to take it seriously which mean we also have to deal with it seriously lord hoffmann say english court will not unless the statute expressly so provide be bind to give effect to interpretation of the treaty by an international court even though the united kingdom be bind by international law to do so he go on to say the sovereign legislator in the united kingdom be parliament if parliament have plainly lay down the law it be the duty of the court to apply it whether that would involve the crown in breach of an international treaty or not nothing could be more explicit nothing could be clear will the hon member give way no amendment put forward by the house of lords completely contradict that principle because in its wording it make both domestic law and international law combine matter of full compliance would go so far as to say that it be impossible in many circumstance to actually arrive at point where there could be full compliance with domestic and international law accord to our constitutional principle be extremely grateful to my hon friend for again make powerful argument about the sovereignty of parliament and he will understand why the sovereignty of parliament be so fundamental in democratic polity parliament speak for the people and be give legitimacy by the people and lawmaker here be answerable to the people international obligation and treaty matter but they do not matter more than the people will be bind to say with no disrespect to the noble lords who pass this amendment with majority of that they do not have that legitimacy because constitutionally they be unelecte that be fundamental point that need to be take into account they have function to perform but it be our intention and the government clear state objective to overturn the amendment the issue go much far and deep in my opinion than just the question of the rwanda bill but it be in the bill in my year in this place or in my constitutional legal practice beforehand have never see any statute that purport to include word that be so all embrace as the word in the amendment do not know who devise the amendment but with majority of we have well look to our merit and make quite sure that we turn it down the people who be behind amendment be internationalist that worry too there be cohort of internationalist in various government departments the home office and the foreign commonwealth and development office in particular be mere back bencher be more than happy to castigate those who want to internationalise the sovereignty of our country have bit of trouble local difficulty as one might say over our leave the european union these internationalist want we to be part and parcel of this great european union and have never be happy in my life than on june when we decide to reject the proposal as have be argue for shall we say for year or two the european union itself be in terrible bind over the global problem of illegal migration have not yet discover what germany will do about its own constitution in this respect it be not just the european union but the united states of america day in day out we see the problem they face on the texas border it be beyond imagination what that country be try to do about the number of people flow in raise all the same kind of question on the international refugee convention this issue affect not just the united kingdom but we be take stand say to my right hon friend the prime minister that by reject the amendment we will enhance our international reputation by use our unwritten constitution to make it clear that what the people want and what the principle of common sense demand be that we just can not allow illegal migration to overtake our entire national interest have be to madrid for summit of the conference of parliamentary committees for union affairs of the parliaments of the european union as the british representative and chairman of the european scrutiny committee and hope to go back again in few week time there be sheer consternation at the last conference which be comprise of the chairman of the european affair or scrutiny committee of the member state they be appal by the proposal by majority vote to accept quota and compulsory fine if they be to have any sensible arrangement in the european union which they can not have because it be inconsistent with their constitutional arrangement it be inconsistent with the charter of fundamental right that be why we need to focus on the european convention on human right in this particular context be not go to make speech about that because that would be outside the term of this debate write to the prime minister many month ago and send he paper of seven page of breach of international law by country from all over the world include in the european union france denmark there be so many of they it be not seven page of argument it be seven page each line of which contain breach of international law by the legion so what be we worry about get on with it we must make sure that we reject this amendment and do not allow the lords if they come back again on ping pong to think that they be go to get away with it we want to be very firm about this we have dualist system we have sovereignty of parliament and we have an elect parliament we have our voter wish to take into account and we should stick by they and do nothing else it be almost two year since the rwanda scheme be first announce by the then home secretary in april this be now the third piece of legislation connect with that scheme when this bill have its second reading in the commons at the end of last year note that the challenge of stop dangerous boat crossing be real and despite what the minister say think it be one that every member of this house wish to address the home affairs committee report on channel crossing be clear there be no magical single solution to deal with irregular migration instead our report recommend detailed evidence drive fully cost and fully test policy initiative to achieve incremental change it also recommend close co operation with international partner those remark be still relevant and it be interesting to note the new tone of the home secretary in say that this policy on rwanda be now only part of the solution to small boat crossing as we know however it be very expensive and use up huge amount of time in this place and great deal of political capital in the absence of any pre exist evidence that the uk rwanda partnership will deliver on its primary objective to deter small boat crossing the need for careful consider and responsible planning and lawmaking be even more acute and that be what the amendment under consideration today seek to address remind the house that the lords as revise chamber have an important job to do in scrutinise legislation and improve it where necessary and think it be helpful for this house to see what improvement the other place be suggest to legislation from this place amendment add requirement to maintain full compliance with domestic and international law note that the minister today and the minister in the other place have argue that the bill be already compliant with the rule of law and that it be predicate on compliance with international law in the form of the treaty the government comment the treaty set out the international legal commitment that the uk and rwandan government have make consistent with their share standard associate with asylum and refugee protection this be the same treaty that the house of lords agree motion not to ratify on january it be the same treaty for which the government refuse to allow time for member of this house to debate and reach view on despite request from the home affairs committee the time period for objection be over and the government can ratify the treaty as long as they lie statement set out why they be do so despite the decision of the lords if the government want we to accept their assurance that the treaty be itself evidence of compliance with international law they should really have give this house the opportunity to debate that treaty in the absence of such an opportunity amendment would provide the reassurance of compliance with domestic and international law as the government insist that the treaty and bill already satisfy the criterion it stand to reason that there should not really be any issue with the amendment will the right hon lady give way be go to carry on the hon gentleman speak at length and want to get through number of amendment turn to amendment and which also relate to the treaty in the other place lord hope argue that rwanda be declare safe country should be dependent on the arrangement provide for in the treaty be fully implement and adhere to in practice with amendment set out what that would actually look like and give the independent monitoring committee significant role in report on this in response the minister in the lords set out that the government would ratify the treaty only once we agree with rwanda that all necessary implementation be in report house of lords march vol as we know the bill will come into force only once the treaty have be ratify again it would have be helpful and beneficial for this house to have have the opportunity to debate the treaty yet scrutiny of its provision do not happen in the commons just as financial detail of the uk rwanda partnership have be hold back from parliament until very recently as highlight in last week estimate day debate on asylum and migration the home office repeatedly refuse the home affairs committee request for basic financial information about the scheme and disclose some of the cost only after our committee join force with the public accounts committee to request national audit office investigation we now know that the core cost be very expensive million for the economic transformation and integration fund an additional per individual relocate furth million once people have be relocate and on top of all that for each individual relocate to rwanda there be direct cost to the home office of million by the end of with million per year in staff cost and for the flight cost of each individual relocate and still do not know whether the home office have be able to enter into contract with an airline to deliver the removal to rwanda crucially though we still have not be tell the cost for implement the provision in the treaty such as new asylum appeal body be there money available and have it be allocate to pay for that we already know that the home office budget be under acute pressure on february this year the home secretary request an emergency drawdown of billion from the reserve because the department have run out of money before the supplementary estimate have be approve with serious question still to answer about how the government will fund the implementation of the treaty and about its practical implementation believe that the amendment help to provide some necessary assurance that the government have hitherto fail to provide to parliament amendment and would make it possible to argue that rwanda be not safe country on the presentation of credible evidence to the contrary and would allow appeal to be bring on that basis respond on behalf of the government the minister in the lords say we have be clear that the purpose of this legislation be to stop the boat and to do that we must create deterrent that show that if you enter the uk illegally you will not be able to stay official report house of lords march vol the home affairs committee have repeatedly ask both ministers and senior official what evidence there be for the deterrent effect of the rwanda scheme the permanent secretary sir matthew rycroft require ministerial direction for the scheme because there be no evidence that it would provide value for money when he give evidence before the committee last year he say that this be because the value for money judgment depend on the amount of deterrence that the policy will produce he note that although the number of people cross the channel be fall it be very hard to tell how much of that be the possibility of be relocate to rwanda particularly as you suggest before the first flight to rwanda have take off the truth be that we actually do not have any idea whether the policy that this bill facilitate will have the deterrent effect that the minister cite as highlight in committee of the whole house it do not seem sensible for the government to propose that the status of rwanda as safe country should be fix for ever more which would by extension make rwanda the only country on earth in which nothing ever happen or change amendment enable the presentation of evidence relate to those change and their implication for safety in rwanda therefore seem eminently reasonable and indeed necessary amendment delete clause and introduce into the bill new clause that allow much wide ground for legal challenge the home affairs select committee have always recognise that appropriate legal challenge be necessary part of any function asylum system amendment disapplie section of the illegal migration act mean that people claim to be child could appeal against decision that they be over the noble baroness lister who table that amendment explain that it be intend to minimise the risk of any unaccompanied child be send to report house of lords march vol during the home affairs committee channel crossing inquiry we hear multiple example of safeguard process fail across various part of the asylum system include case of child be mistaken for adult section of the illegal migration act refer to the process of age assessment in the nationality and borders act the committee channel crossing report note that that act contain number of provision relate to age assessment include new national age assessment board and power for the home secretary to make regulation specify scientific method for age assessment our report note the provision be controversial because there be broad consensus that age assessment should not rely exclusively or for some stakeholder at all on analysis of the skeleton or the tooth be concerned that without the amendment table by baroness lister the bill could produce situation where child be wrongly assess as be an adult and send to rwanda will the right hon lady give way be go to carry on because want other member to be able to speak amendment relate to the timetable for removal under the illegal migration act it would require the home secretary to lay before parliament statement set out all the individual whose asylum claim have be deem inadmissible since that act receive royal assent the statement would have to include the number of individual due to be remove to rwanda and the timetable for those removal as well as the arrangement for those individual not be remove to rwanda again that be information that the home affairs committee have already try to glean from the home office indeed when the home secretary appear before the committee in january ask he how many individual whose asylum claim have be deem inadmissible since the illegal migration act receive royal assent would be send to rwanda he reply that will depend on which other country we have return agreement with despite press he several time on that point our attempt to ascertain any further information be unsuccessful as the noble lord coaker say when move his amendment this be subject on which it would be good to have some fact that be why his amendment have significant merit will the right hon lady give way on that point the hon lady be try to get in so will give way but be keen to finish be grateful to she for give way because be hop to intervene on the snp spokesperson the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss on similar point when it come to fact be concerned that those be present be slightly selective particularly in relation to age assessment in the house of lords the evidence that be bring before their lordship be that as the right hon lady know the age estimation science advisory committee the expert committee that be independent and have be set up independently have propose that the accuracy of age assessment will be improve in multiple way not just use one biological method but range of method alongside the exist one be concerned that partial evidence about age assessment be be present in today debate and would be very grateful for the right hon lady confirmation that she support the inclusion of those important method of age assessment that the committee have recommend in order to support accurate age assessment for safeguard child very briefly be report what the cross party home affairs committee decide and put in our report on cross channel small boat crossing we produce that report nearly two year ago this matter have be go on for some time be report our concern which be widely share among all member of the committee about the problem that exist it be very difficult to assess the correct age of person who claim to be child so it be worth reflect that this be not easy and the home affairs committee be mindful and concerned about it it would be very helpful if the minister be able to give little more information on the widely circulate story about the number of individual who might be send to rwanda after royal assent the story now seem to be that people will travel to rwanda but that there will be pause and that it will be staggered process it would be helpful to understand that and how it fit with the context of the thousand who have already be deem to be inadmissible to the asylum system it would also be helpful to hear about the scheme voluntary nature again it have be widely report in the press that people will be offer to travel to rwanda all of this be widely circulate in the press but minister have not give the house this information the home affairs committee certainly have not receive any information as say on thursday it be regrettable that we can not have access to financial and practical information about how scheme will work and that we repeatedly have to ask for basic information to allow we to come to view on the government proposal the home office say it be very keen on scrutiny but as chair of the home affairs committee have to say that have certainly not be my experience over the past few year the home office do not want scrutiny and any attempt to obtain information be rebuff lord amendment be table by the noble baroness butler sloss formidable character who have fight modern slavery for year when she table amendment we would do well to consider they carefully her amendment would create an exception relate to the removal of victim of modern slavery and human trafficking person with positive reasonable ground decision from the national referral mechanism must not be remove from the united kingdom on the basis of the rwanda treaty until conclusive ground decision have be make person with positive conclusive ground decision must not be remove without decision maker consider whether such removal would negatively affect the physical health mental health or safety of that person the home affairs committee recently produce its report on human trafficking in which we express our concern that the government be prioritise irregular migration issue at the expense of tackle human trafficking human trafficking be not an immigration offence but an exploitation offence and the two thing must not be conflate people should not have to choose between continue to be exploit or risk deportation to rwanda point make to we very forcefully by the former prime minister the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may that be why believe that lords amendment have merit lord amendment table by the noble lord browne would provide an exemption for people who have support the armed force overseas or who have otherwise be agent or ally of the uk overseas when look at the composition of those travel in small boat the top group be from it be worth consider why they be travel in small boat when we have set up scheme to facilitate people to travel from afghanistan these lords amendment go some way towards address concern that the home affairs committee have identify in relation to the rwanda scheme and think the government should give they serious consideration be disappointed that the minister have be so dismissive of the genuine reason for table these amendment do not think the parliamentary scrutiny of the bill and its associate treaty have be very satisfactory debate on the treaty be deny and the provision of crucial information have be reject for month on end to stop the small boat and to make the asylum system fit for purpose we need an evidence base approach that be inform and strengthen by parliamentary scrutiny which have sadly be limit during the passage of the bill rise on point of order mr deputy speaker in no way wish to seem churlish but the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson refuse to accept an intervention from on the ground that have talk for too long she have just manage to exceed the length of my speech by five minute order have to say to the hon gentleman that that be not even nice try call alexander stafford it be pleasure to speak in this very important debate which be about defeat these awful amendment from the house of lords and then get the bill through parliament the flight off to rwanda and the wheel down in kigali the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock claim that labour support the lords amendment not in order to wreck the bill but to help it along and make it well yet we also hear from the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss speak from the snp front bench that they want to upset the bill these be clearly wreck amendment there be no if or but about it my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash in his rejection of lords amendment make clear the dangerous precedent it would set not just for this bill but for all bills for the supremacy and primacy of this house and that be the first thing we need to reflect on properly this parliament be sovereign the house of commons be sovereign by take that sovereignty away from we we upset everything lord amendment talk about compliance with the rule of law how can it be against the rule of law when the democratically elect body of this house want something and the free and independent sovereign country of rwanda want something by reject the amendment we will enhance our sovereignty and the bill it be clear that the bill be need but why be it so needed and why be it essential that we stop these wreck amendment for far too long we have have far too many illegal immigrant come into our country those illegal immigrant who be jump the queue by go outside the rule and regulation on how they should come into our country be make it hard and hard for people in this country the bill be necessary need and proportionate illegal immigrant be put huge strain on public service they be put huge strain on the thing that everyday people use doctor gp service school the human cost of people be kill as they travel across the channel need to stop the financial cost to resident in rother valley and across our area need to be curtail the amendment try to wreck the bill and that be why we need to double down for some reason we have have lot of debate about how many people will go to rwanda that be clearly out of the scope of the bill but many opposition members mention it we have hear estimate of or handful sincerely hope that the number will be in the thousand and ten of thousand to get rid of the backlog and stop the illegal immigrant come here fundamentally the point of the bill be to stop illegal immigrant come here any attempt to wreck it be an open door policy to let human trafficker traffic people illegally into our country and upset our local community ultimately more people will die if the bill do not pass because of the loss of life in the channel no one have really talk about the bill deterrent factor similar process work in australia where illegal immigration rapidly decrease due to the deterrent effect and it be important that we reflect on that if we stop people come here in the first place we will save life and save money so it be so important that we get the bill through my hon friend refer to the australian system which be know as operation sovereign borders it be true that the offshore processing that australia enjoy be only part of the solution and the government have always acknowledge that rwanda be not be all and end all but it be critical part of our policy as it be in australia wonder whether he might comment on this it seem to that the house of lords be either careless about the threat of our border be breach with impunity or clueless because it do not know it be happen which do he think it be careless or clueless would not wish to comment on what be go on in their lordship mind but clearly they do not care about the concern of the average person in rother valley about the high level of illegal immigration which hear about when knock on door their lordship clearly do not care about the people die while try to cross the channel they clearly do not care about the cost to the public purse of hundred of thousand of illegal immigrant come over here they clearly do not care about the everyday person in the street their lordship ultimately be not democratically elect and answerable to the people we be and that be the crucial point we be the voice of the people we be answerable to the electorate we be answerable to our constituent and we need to get this stop there be so much more in the lords amendment that will upset and disrupt the bill so will touch on few more of they first want to talk about lords amendment and which talk about whether rwanda be safe country would be very careful about some of the word use by opposition members to describe rwanda fundamentally rwanda be safe country not only be we in this house declare it to be safe but it be patently true to say that rwanda be not safe be fundamentally colonialist attitude to other part of the world we be say to another country your country be not safe your country be not good enough we on the government benches be say that rwanda be safe the million tourist who go to rwanda last year will the hon gentleman give way of course if rwanda be such wonderful place to be deport to why would the prospect of be deport there be deterrent that be an interesting point be under no illusion that rwanda be great country but will tell the hon gentleman country that be even well than rwanda the united kingdom so of course they want to come to britain because we be well country that do not mean that rwanda be not safe or that it should not be safe on lords amendment and the government have already complete detailed assessment that rwanda be safe country we need to accept the fact of that assessment and start to take even more action while the boat crossing be low and they be low they be down last year as my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes mention that be because of the other stuff we be do such as the albanian deal which be work and stop the boat physically get to the source do my hon friend agree that another safe country be france thank my hon friend who do so much work on this issue in her constituency indeed france be very safe country as be spain italy germany and so many country cross by illegal immigrant they should claim asylum in the first safe country they have no duty or right to come over this way but we do have right and duty to protect our country protect our border protect our sovereignty and protect our people that be why we need to have clear idea of who be come here and ensure that we can deport the people we do not want or do not need and process they elsewhere turn back to lords amendment and we can not allow individual to challenge their removal ground on the basis that rwanda be not safe country the uk government have make the assessment and we can not let the amendment allow for individual to challenge their removal ground new international treaty mean that our decision can not be second guess and that be vital in move forward with this legislation disagree with lords amendment and as rwanda have its own safeguarding system to ensure the safety of individual who will be relocate to rwanda if we start question each claim and whether to send they to rwanda we be adhere to the idea that rwanda be not safe country which contradict the safeguarding process that rwanda have already introduce we have already identify that rwanda be safe country so it should not be up for interpretation base on an individual claim that they can not be send there also disagree with lords amendment as it can incorrectly favour individual who want to abuse our immigration system we need robust measure to be implement to ensure that the rwanda plan be execute with efficiency to prevent those who want to play the system we need to ensure that this be the tough legislation ever we need to do everything we can to prevent individual from impersonate child to bypass the rwanda scheme we have already discuss check on whether people be child to protect child we need to make sure who be child and who be not there be safe and independent way of verify person age that go on in other country believe german and maybe france use similar process and do not think any of we be claim that france or germany be not safe country if it be good for they it be good for we we hear how the legislation in germany and france be different from our but if they can have such check then so should we they will safeguard the british people but also genuine child refugee to make sure they be not put in an awful situation be extremely grateful to my hon friend for give way on two occasion he will remember that when we be debate an early piece of legislation with the then minister my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick this issue of age verification be raise my hon friend be right to say that other country use it on that occasion my right hon friend explain why it be so important it be because the old so call asylum seeker find to be here claim to be child turn out to be year of age thank my right hon friend for that apposite intervention that be the concern have situation where some people can claim they be child when they be year old be not good for anyone we have be debate the rwanda scheme in one shape or form for two year and at every step of the way opposition members have be wreck it these amendment be just the late of their objection to it do my hon friend share my concern that the snp object to the regulation on age verification while the labour party do not even vote on the regulation which have to be carry by conservative vote thank my hon friend for that observation that be shocking and it just show where the care and safeguarding of child lie in their priority as local member of parliament know what labour think about safeguard our girl in rotherham we should be able to look after everyone this bill will ensure that we look after the people in britain that we give sovereignty to our people and that we control our border we have have two year of dither and delay of wreck amendment of plane not take off of people be pull off plane and of opposition members try everything possible to stop this well need well like and well support policy go forward anybody try to support the amendment be no well than those who want to wreck the bill and have an open door policy say to all member of this house that we must reject the lords amendment we must stand up for britain we must stand up for our sovereignty and we must get wheel down in kigali as soon as possible rise to support the lords amendment lord amendment and because they be basic humanitarian amendment design to exempt from the process of be send to rwanda the victim of modern slavery and human trafficking as well as our agent our ally who have support his majesty armed force overseas and person who have be employ or indirectly contract to provide service to the uk it would be shameful if this house do not support those amendment will direct most of my remark to lords amendment to lords amendment relate to whether the bill be fully compliant with the rule of law and lords amendment to broadly deal with the issue of the safety of rwanda as have be advert to early in the debate visit rwanda last month as part of the joint committee on human rights delegation we will be report in due course on our finding as part of our inquiry into the human right of asylum seeker therefore although be chair of the committee any comment that make today be in personal capacity because the committee have not yet deliberate be firmly of the view that rwanda can not be describe as safe country for the united kingdom to send asylum seeker to that be base on what observe there but also base on objective evidence about such arrangement as presently exist in rwanda for asylum seeker not refugee on their border but asylum seeker the degree of expertise among its immigration officer lawyer and judiciary and crucially evidence that the joint committee on human rights have receive about the state of human right in rwanda and perhaps most importantly information collate by the home office which refer to early about the state of human right in rwanda will come on to that in moment when we be in rwanda we meet many government official and organisation most of whom meet with government approval and naturally they have good story to tell we like the supreme court believe that they be in good faith but we need to weigh that against the evidence of what we have hear from other the evidence collate by the home office about human right abuse in rwanda and also recognition of how long it will take rwanda to put in place the arrangement require by the fresh treaty and for they to bed down in connection with that remind member of this house what the house of lords international agreements committee say when it undertake its scrutiny of the new treaty in january it say while the treaty might in time provide the basis for such an assessment of rwanda as safe country if it be rigorously implement as thing stand the arrangement it provide for be incomplete significant number of further legal and practical step be require under the treaty which will take time the international agreements committee list those it go on to say that the arrangement put in place by the treaty need time to bed in to demonstrate that they operate in practice the home office have be unable to offer any clear timeline for implementation but we the house of lords international agreements committee agree with the evidence we receive that the treaty be unlikely to change the position in rwanda in the short to medium term rise let just develop this point and then will take some intervention agree with the house of lords on that it fit with what observe on the ground in rwanda which will come on to in moment importantly the hon member for bosworth dr evans who be no long in his place early refer to what he describe as the view of the unhcr when meet unhcr official on the ground in rwanda they say that they do not believe that rwanda be safe country for asylum seeker they say that it will take systemic and structural change to happen first and then that change will need to cascade through the system that will take time also believe that great commitment to meaningful human right protection be require the hon and learn lady be make as she usually do consider argument base on her visit to rwanda have not be there wonder whether in make that argument she be mindful that previously both the united nations and the eu have designate rwanda as suitable place to accept refugee what do she make of that the rwandans host more than refugee on their border who have come over from neighbouring country such as burundi and the congo because of conflict in those country they be people from neighbouring country who have the ambition to go back to their own country as soon as they can and they live in refugee camp on the border they be completely different category from asylum seeker who have seek to come to the uk and who be go to be send to rwanda that be not just my view that be the view of the unhcr rise will give way to the hon member who be member of the joint committee on human rights thank the hon lady for give way be also in that meeting with the unhcr be it not also true that when we question the official about their motivation for why they feel that we should not be send our asylum seeker there for processing they be very clear that it be because they feel that we be shirk our responsibility that we should be take all those asylum seeker and that we have the capacity to be it not also true that in that meeting they agree that they base their emergency transit base there that they sponsor scholarship in rwandan university for refugee it be very safe place let quote from my own note say so it be nothing to do with safety it be because you feel that we should be do this ourselves and they say yes too have detailed note of our meeting with the people from unhcr the hon lady be right to say that the unhcr say quite clearly that it think that the united kingdom be shirk its responsibility and actually so do that be my personal belief base that on the number of refugee there be in the world there be more than million displace people and more than million refugee in the world really quite small number of they make their way to the shore of the united kingdom there will be hell of lot more in the year to come because of climate change and my very firm belief be that the united kingdom need to shoulder its responsibility as one of the rich country in the world rather than shuffle these people off on to country such as rwanda which as we see have make great stride but it can not be compare with the united kingdom in wealth little more about why do not believe that rwanda can yet be describe as safe country mention in an intervention that it be important to read the united kingdom supreme court judgment in its entirety particularly paragraph to the decision be base on number of thing evidence about the general human right situation in rwanda the adequacy of rwanda current asylum system and rwanda failure to meet its obligation under similar agreement regard asylum seeker with israel in there be lot to the judgment it be very rich in detail the court consider lot of evidence over long period it be really not an adequate acknowledgment of the exercise in which the supreme court be engage to simply say that few month later an act of parliament can change the reality on the ground and solve all the legitimate concern that the supreme court have about the situation in rwanda yes the united kingdom government have enter into new agreement but the trouble be that none of the new measure to which rwanda and the uk have agree be yet properly in place the uk government insistence that since the supreme court consider judgment last year rwanda have miraculously become safe country for asylum seeker can only be describe as legal fiction nothing see on the ground in kigali lead to doubt that when we be there the relevant legislation be still go through the parliament the legal reform and new system agree have yet to be put in place and although training have commence it be still very much in its infancy the supreme court find that the rwandans be act in good faith but that intention and aspiration do not necessarily correspond to reality have spend some time in rwanda and meet with rwandan government official healthcare worker ministers lawyer those who will deliver the legal training its national commission for human right and non governmental organisation think that the supreme court get it right the rwandans be act in good faith but intention and aspiration do not correspond to reality we hear very interesting fact owe to their recent history of rwandans have themselves be refugee as say on their border they accommodate well over refugee and displace person from neighbouring country many of the rwandans meet be at pain to emphasise to that they see refugee as their friend their brother and their sister be very strike by how their attitude contrast with the uk government hostility towards asylum seeker and desire to offload both their legal and believe their moral responsibility to asylum seeker on to other when the joint committee on human rights consider the uk government original agreement with rwanda and the illegal migration act we express concern that the policy could be see as an outsourcing of the uk own obligation under the refugee convention to another country know that not everyone will agree with that but give the number of displace person and refugee in the world compare with the tiny fraction we take think that we be not live up to our moral obligation clearly there be legal argument that we be not do so the joint committee on human rights also say back when we consider the original agreement with rwanda and the act remove asylum seeker to state where they face real risk of serious human right abuse or of be send on to dangerous third country as result of an inadequate asylum system be inconsistent with the uk human right obligation will the hon and learn lady give way give way to the hon lady who be also on the visit to kigali the hon and learn lady say that the uk be take tiny number of refugee and asylum seeker be not sure that that be true but would be interested to know what she consider to be reasonable number or whether she believe that there be not one do not have time to get into redesign the system well during our inquiry as the hon lady will recall the committee hear very detailed evidence about what might be reasonable number and how the number we take compare with the number of refugee in the world we hear very detailed evidence from the chief executive officer of the refugee council enver solomon about what might be compassionate but reasonable way for the united kingdom to approach its moral and legal obligation let focus on why support the amendment that relate to the lack of safe situation in rwanda many of those meet in rwanda be very keen to emphasise that their write constitution contain good human right protection which it do but few of they be able to point to any case law show people in rwanda take advantage of those protection as we be at least for the time be able to in this country also find out when be in rwanda that in the rwandan government withdraw the right of individual petition to the african court on human and peoples right because they be unhappy with the way in which it handle claim bring by rwandan dissident could not help but see an echo in that of the uk government attitude towards the european court of human rights when it make decision that they do not like as say in an intervention the home office have compile page country information note on human right in rwanda collate information from source range from the us state department to human rights watch and set out serious shortcoming in the protection of human right in rwanda ask the minister about that and he seem very reluctant to engage with that point hope that he will come back to it how do he reconcile his and his colleague repeat insistence that rwanda be safe country with the page document issue by his own government and update in january this year it set out how it collate the evidence and say that it try to take thing only from reliable source one of the big source in the document be the us state department the state department of one of our major ally would there not be some sense in allow home office decision maker to take account of the home office evidence that have be gather together in the way that the hon and learn lady describe the document be withdraw for while and update in january so only see it and read it in detail just before my trip to rwanda be really quite appalled that government ministers could continue to state that rwanda be safe country from human right perspective in the face of the evidence that they themselves collate really want to hear colourable answer to that point before the joint committee on human rights leave the uk we take step to find out about the human right situation in rwanda the evidence that we hear give great cause for concern about the curtailment of freedom of expression in rwanda for those who wish to criticise the government the us state department amnesty international and human rights watch have report evidence of unlawful or arbitrary killing disappearance and torture one area of particular concern for asylum seeker send from the uk be the protection of same sex attract and transgender people the foreign office travel advice for rwanda warn british gay people and british tran people that individual can experience discrimination and abuse include from local authority there be no specific anti discrimination law that protect individual when put that to government official and other with whom we meet be reassure that the rwandan constitution contain general protection against discrimination which it do but sexuality and gender identity be not list there crucially nobody be able to show any evidence that gay or transgender person have ever avail themselves of the anti discrimination protection in the constitution people be at great pain to tell that homosexuality and transgenderism be not criminal offence in rwanda sorry to be light hearted but whoop de doo as lesbian can tell the house that the mere fact that one be not criminalise be only the start of the story think rwanda be where the uk be on lgbt right about year ago yes it be ahead of many other african country because it be not illegal to be gay or tran in rwanda but there be no positive right and no equal right protection we need to acknowledge that because there be people who come to the united kingdom because they be gay transexual or transgender and they know that we in the united kingdom have great world class equal right for gay and transgender people if they be come here for those protection they be perfectly entitle to be concern about be send to country such as rwanda where no such protection exist many other come to this country because they be dissident in their country they have criticise their government they come to the united kingdom because so far at least touch wood we still have freedom of expression be not sure that rwanda can be describe as have the same freedom of expression protection that we enjoy in the uk asylum seeker also come to this country who have be human right defender in their country and have be persecute for it again touch wood we in this country still have full human right protection that base on the evidence of the home office itself be not the position in rwanda thank the hon and learn lady for give way again the anti discrimination law in the rwandan constitution be not something that just ethereally hang there in fact be it not true that because of their recent history of genocide it be deeply ingrain feeling among rwandans that everybody be equal and there be no discrimination the law do not even allow ask someone whether they be tutsi or hutu they be very very sensitive to anybody discriminate about anything be it not also true that the head of two non governmental lgbt organisation we speak to be very clear we have very good dig into this my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson ask they whether it would be okay for gay people to hold hand walk down the street in rwanda and their answer be yes of course the hon and learn lady then ask if there might be order that be speech not an intervention be terribly sorry but must ask the hon lady to resume her seat my answer to the hon lady be that as say at the outset of my speech in assess whether rwanda be safe country for asylum seeker particularly lgbt asylum seeker we need to consider what we hear from people when we be there as well as the objective evidence she will recall that question several people on this subject no one be able to give an example of any gay or transgender person ever avail themselves of the law to protect their right there be difference between that and the position in the united kingdom where anyone who be same sex attract or transgender be protect by the equality act and by the european convention on human right if they lose their job or be refuse housing for example they can go to court we need to look at what we hear in rwanda we hear very positive thing from two government approve lgbt right non governmental organisation but there be also evidence again particularly in the home office note suggest that the situation be rather different interruption the hon member for hartlepool jill mortimer may scoff but that note be prepare by her government the hon and learn lady be make case about the importance of evidence do she agree that there be evidence right in front of we in the fact that the uk government accept asylum claim from number of people from rwanda at the back end of last year if it really be the paradise that we have just be hear about and if we can guarantee that into the future it be quite surprising that people from that country be claim asylum in the uk rise order before the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry resume her speech remind she that we be begin to go very wide again would be grateful if she could come back directly to the amendment although understand the context in which she be try to make her remark while be on my foot may say that although appreciate that she be be very careful we be get on to fairly thin ice when we start talk about jchr report that have not be publish yet we need to be little careful be crystal clear at the start of my speech that be speak in personal capacity just as anything that have write about my trip to rwanda be write in personal capacity the report that refer to be historical report of the committee have go out of my way to make it clear that be speak in personal capacity explain in some detail that the committee will deliberate and will report on its trip to rwanda in future these be my personal reflection but they be evidence base and stand by they think that they be an important contribution to this and do not intend to be shout down by the right hon and learn member for northampton north sir michael ellis or anyone else who do not want to hear lawyerly evidence base contribution interruption be terribly sorry if be bore he but he will be pleased to hear that be come to the end of my speech very soon to sum up base on the evidence that have read and that the joint committee on human rights have hear so far and base on what hear and see on the ground in kigali remain of the view that rwanda be still not safe country for asylum seeker which be why support lords amendment to be fortify in do so by know that the house of lords international agreements committee be of the same opinion when it undertake its scrutiny of the treaty as be the unhcr on the ground which tell that systemic and structural change need to happen in rwanda and then need to cascade believe that that will take time and that great commitment to meaningful human right protection be require rise order say that we be skate on fairly thin ice because other equally impressive legal advice suggest that there be three member of the joint committee in the chamber who have come fairly close to quote report that have not yet be publish hope that the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry will accept the admonition in the term in which it be offer call dr caroline johnson rise to support the government in reject the lords amendment will focus particularly on amendment and amendment state that the secretary of state or an immigration officer could decide if rwanda be safe country for the person in question it be clearly wreck amendment wonder whether those immigration officer will go to rwanda as and other member of the joint committee do last month because if they do their position on rwanda may change during our visit to rwanda see in kigali beautiful city and we meet many very welcome people as the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry say many people in the rwandan population be refugee and as such they be keen to support refugee and give they the good future we see the housing and education provision that the government of rwanda have make jointly with the uk government to support refugee on arrival and the level of detail with which they have consider what people may need when they arrive we see country that have welcome people from burundi the democratic republic of the congo and transit camp in libya and accommodate an entire medical school from south sudan girl school from afghanistan and large number of lgbt individual from across african nation because of its relative safety for they we also see country scar by the genocide year ago that be keen and ambitious to work together for cohesive and successful future as for what we hear on our visit in the word of her late majesty the queen recollections may vary think it would be helpful as we have hear contrast opinion to give little information about lgbt protection under propose subsection in lords amendment court or tribunal would be able to say that rwanda be not safe country for the person in question or for group of person to which that person belong be very keen to see what lgbt right there be in rwanda and to learn whether it be indeed safe country while we be out there we learn from supreme court judge the president of the rwanda bar association and the chief executive of the legal aid forum in rwanda that rwanda have an anti discrimination law in its constitution which can be litigate on if need be we visit kepler high education college where we speak to student and staff include the chief executive who have move to rwanda from canada and the diversity officer for the institution we hear from all those people the student staff chief executive and diversity officer that it be safe place for lgbt individual to live they do say that there be some who be what they call quietly disapprove among some of the old population in rwanda note that while we have be talk there have be debate in westminster hill about lgbt content in the curriculum which suggest sadly that the same may be true in this country we also meet lgbt activist group and be not aware until the hon and learn lady say so that they be government approve or that any of the people we meet be necessarily government approve in that respect they describe themselves as lgbt activist they be from two different organisation and they like other tell we that gay people can walk hand in hand with each other and be able to campaign openly without fear another issue want to raise be about subsection in lords amendment on decision maker consider whether there be real risk that rwanda will remove or send the person to another state in contravention of its international obligation this be the business of refoulement which be bring up by our supreme court how can someone prove they will not do something until they have not do it that be quite difficult to prove note that other hon member have mention that somebody may have be subject to refoulement more than year ago and that may be true but the question be whether it will be true now rwanda which have the world watch it have enter into legally bind treaty it be very ambitious for its future and its population and government be very genuinely care for those who seek refuge why would they breach the treaty what damage would it do to the rwandan government reputation to breach such regulation by the refoulement of people it would do huge damage and therefore think we can trust they have meet member of the government and member of the public there think we can trust they not to do that my hon friend as and many other member of this house do seek to strengthen this bill include clause know that people individual circumstance as they game the asylum system can be acquire alter or amend and frequently be however lords amendment to which she refer not only do not strengthen the bill it weaken it it make clause even weak and the interim order that would be issue as result of that amendment would delay obfuscate and make nonsense of the intention of the bill she know that she have articulate it very well as she always do and the lords know it too this be wreck amendment nothing more and nothing less completely agree with my right hon friend it be as he say one of many wreck amendment that the lords have pass we understand that those in the other place wish to do so but as democratically elect chamber we need to send the bill back to the lords with very clear message that this be what the people of the united kingdom want to see want to clear up an issue relate to our meeting with the unhcr base on the contemporaneous note that make in rwanda and have with in the chamber today the unhcr representative in rwanda be ask why there be an apparent contradiction between its desire to bring refugee to rwanda from other nation but specifically not from the uk what be it about person have come from the uk that make they less safe in rwanda than person who have come from afghanistan directly which do not seem to make sense to the lady say very clearly that rwanda be welcome country she say this have nothing to do with the safety of rwanda and she feel that the uk should keep its own asylum claimant and be concern about rwanda capacity she also say that she think the uk have more experienced system and she feel that because most of the current refugee rwanda be of they be from congo or burundi there be similar culture and similar ethnic and religious population she think there would therefore be great inclusion more quickly and that people would integrate more quickly ask she to expand on whether the un would be more supportive of the scheme if all the individual relocate be of such origin but she be not willing to answer that question want to touch on lords amendment there have be much talk this afternoon about the safety of child in rwanda the government clearly have duty to protect all child but one of the challenge be that we know that there be people who will pretend to be child when they be not my right hon friend give the example of gentleman who do that at the age of the government have to protect child by prevent they from be deport to place they should not be deport to but they also have duty to protect child in the united kingdom from be accommodate or educate with people who be not child and who may therefore cause they harm in my view the government have duty to make their good effort these system be not perfect but they be the good we have so it be right that the government make their good effort to ensure that they do assess the age of child use the most important medical intervention we have at the moment be pleased to say that will be support the government this evening rise order we be introduce an eight minute limit straightaway be hop to get the minister on his foot to respond no later than pm clearly if we finish before then the minister may have more time this government remain in disarray for all the wrong reason over this horrendous bill applaud the noble lords in the name of decency and humanity for bring forward these amendment the decision to force those seek refuge here on to cramp barge the bibby stockholm dock at portland port be rightly condemn by human right group as inhumane and dangerous and it have already see at least one suicide yet this government want to outdo themselves in their contempt for human right and life by send vulnerable asylum seeker who have already be through living and torturous nightmare to get here to country that our supreme court have rule can not be consider safe the government be now resist amendment from the other place that be clearly design to prevent injustice and to stop the government exploit the illegal migration act to truncate the process of force refugee to country that do not become safe simply because it be call safe that be how profound the conservatives contempt for justice and the rule of law be the idea that rwanda become safe simply by declare it so be self evidently nonsense it be nothing more than manoeuvre to scrape for vote by pander to racism if the government declare tomorrow that gaza be safe safe destination would that mean no more bomb bullet or starvation there it seem that the government think they can make juggle knife safe simply by declare it safe presumably any finger chop off would be someone else fault anyone else as long as our government get their way as the lords amendment make clear the bill remain clearly at odd with human right law and our commitment under international convention thus the lords amendment be an attempt to mitigate some of the bad harm of manoeuvre that sham our nation it be one that in effect try to opt the uk out of international human right law by say that the court can not take it into account all while the prime minister try to save face by say that the uk will not actually be leave those international agreement amnesty international have rightly condemn this assault on human right as callous immoral and an attack on the basic protection that keep we all safe it be also hugely expensive one this wicked scheme have already cost the uk million in payment to rwanda with at least another million to come the bill fail to understand that there be no such thing as an illegal asylum seeker and that safe and legal route be need to well protect all asylum seeker this bill be ridiculous and toxic racist and cruel and it show contempt for our legal system the government would have we believe that such attitude reflect british value but surely the people of this country stand for something well than stoke fear and hate towards desperate refugee alongside disdain for our legal system believe this whole bill should be reject but support all the amendment send from the other place as they go at least some way towards reduce its poison all member who have sit through debate on these matter in recent year must be feel strong sense of déjà vu today it be almost two year ago today that we be consider lords amendment to the nationality and borders bill some of which fit closely in with this debate and the amendment that have come back from their lordship they touch on process asylum claim for third party issue around the safeguarding of child and obviously the safety of asylum seeker this debate and these lords amendment should be focus on the provision in this bill and ensure that the migration and economic development partnership that be what it be call with rwanda can be operationalise and deliver as plan the house of lords have vital role to play in provide challenge and scrutiny like hope all member have read the contribution from the debate in the other place lord baker of dorking who understand these issue have be home secretary in the make some insightful comment on deal with migration and the challenge and on the wide issue around asylum seeker criminality and all those point that encapsulate the challenge confront the government today debate about the amendment should be balance act recognise that there be political choice that have to be make we have to recognise that some of the international convention and agreement on human right that have be mention be design in different era the unhcr have be mention and have have many direct conversation with its director it subscribe to the eu position of burden share across country around the world but that be not position we subscribe to and we should continue to uphold that and stand up for our own position the government through their proposal be try to put forward solution note that the lord bishop of durham speak in measured and thoughtful term about the development and commitment from rwanda but he raise concern over the opportunity that would exist for those transfer to rwanda that be why we negotiate this partnership it be an economic and migration partnership it be an innovative approach as be the first to say when launch it from the dispatch box it be novel and it be innovative but importantly we put security and scrutiny measure in place the monitoring committee which have not be discuss enough today but be mention in the lords amendment basically do what this house have ask for as their lordship themselves will know be very concerned that some of the amendment be intend to derail the bill and what be pragmatic and innovative should stick with that word approach to tackle these issue want to touch on few of the amendment but many have be debate already so will not cover they all my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash touch on amendment and be in complete agreement with he lord amendment table by baroness lister on child have be subject to debate we must recognise that it be the nationality and borders act that put forward amendment and change around safeguard child in our education system and local government system that be vital the lords table this amendment offer we moment to reflect on implement these measure and proposal that be absolutely vital as these be important provision do my right hon friend agree that measure to assess the age of child be necessary as there be adult who will pretend to be child my hon friend be absolutely right when be home secretary the case be bring to of year old who be masquerade as child and that become national story through that we look at the age assessment measure and work with scientist and we look at eu country and what they be do urge the government to get on and implement the provision time have lag too long now almost two year have pass and these safeguard and protection be absolutely critical it be important to remind the house especially those tempt to back the lords amendment of the reason why we have this bill and the partnership again it be because of the global challenge that we face on migration this be not about disregard for human life that be what the people trafficker have and that be what we be have to tackle life lose at sea in the channel and horrific and brutal act have hear about they and have see they and know sadly too much about criminal gang benefit and profiteer from these barbaric act the partnership itself be evolve it be start to look somewhat different from the original economic and migration partnership and that link to the concept of voluntary removal raise by the shadow front bench spokesperson the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock we touch on it last thursday in the estimate debate as well in the light of the recent announcement be sure the minister will address it and that their lordships and all member will want to press on it as well there be benefit to voluntary return the principle have be in place for number of year and it do work and we should encourage it but there be the whole issue about re entry ban section of the nationality and borders act amend section of the immigration act to deal with re entry we have to be honest about this they do take place even though voluntary removal happen whatever happen in term of the operationalisation of this bill it be important now that loophole be shut down effectively the voluntary removal scheme be strong but we must make it work my final point be that that there be so many aspect to these amendment even lord browne amendment it be tragic that we be debate afghans who should have be resettle in the right way in our country for various reason it pain to listen to the lords debate this we have proud record in this area and all of our constituency have be host to so many people from afghanistan remember operation pitting as if it be yesterday it be moment of crisis and border force staff be put into afghanistan and into kabul to do the right thing to do the airlift and to work with the ministry of defence it be harrowing time but the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme and the afghan citizen resettlement scheme and everything that follow be do in good faith and we must uphold those principle to conclude this be pivotal moment for the safety of rwanda bill and the government overall approach will be vote against the lords amendment but whatever direction the house choose to take on this overall policy we must recognise that we be send out very strong message to the british people who be exasperate because they see government whose hand be constantly tie there be carousel now revolving door with setback after setback and the government must now be give not just the benefit of the doubt but the tool and the ability to get on and operationalise this policy we be at pivotal stage the right hon lady mention the afghan scheme understand that the debate be about the safety of rwanda but have concern about this and have deal with afghani refugee as the right hon lady know many of they be on the edge of real mental health issue as result of the trial they have experience and think the experience of they come here and be put at risk of be deport again to another state will push many of they over the edge that must be take into account as factor and that be why the amendment from the lords be so significant absolutely and fully understand the right hon gentleman position on this but this be moment of reflection for the government too particularly around those who serve our country and work alongside we in afghanistan the government need to clarify how they have aid and continue to aid those people some of whom be on the border of pakistan which have range of migration and governance problem right now to conclude we be at pivotal moment with this legislation we be also at crucial moment in our relationship with the government of rwanda who have be solid and respected partner diligently work with we obviously speak with full experience as the original architect of the migration and economic development partnership we have to go back to the basic of that partnership as say last week in the house thing have move beyond some of the core principle of the original partnership urge the government to do what they need to do in this house today and to settle some of the issue but really they need just to knuckle down and work on the operational delivery of the scheme it be pleasure to follow the right hon lady particularly give the context she give to this debate which be important and worth reflect on for second or two she remind we that this be in fact the third bill in this area in this parliament indeed as the shadow minister the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock point out towards the end of his remark we now have another innovation people be to be offer cash payment to take the opportunity of go to rwanda what do three bills and still evolve political situation and portfolio of arrangement tell we they tell we that this government have no strategic purpose in how they be tackle this problem and that have become apparent from number of the intervention today we have speak an awful lot about the rule of law to be honest this bill and this debate be not about the rule of law they be an entirely political exercise be pretty certain that the government will win the vote tonight that they will face down their lordship and that they will get their way would be astonish if any of the legislation make any significant difference at the end of the day because this be not about the law or even about meaningful approach to the problem of boat in the channel it be all about politic in the run up to the election one of the most tell intervention come from the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright and his point about permanence which be absolutely on point it be not without significance that nobody have choose to pick it up because do not think there be an answer or at least no good answer on the question of permanence let we not ignore the context of where rwanda be and where rwanda have be politically and in relation to its neighbour in january the us state department be say to rwanda and the democratic republic of the congo that they have to walk back from the brink in the conflict between they if either or both of they choose not to where will that leave the safety and stability of rwanda as destination for we to send people the determination as the shadow minister say to legislate to say that somehow or another the sky can be green and the grass can be blue take no account of those real challenge that be come down the track the government should look at the author of the amendment that they will knock back today one be lord hope of craighead remember when he be first appoint as lord president in scotland and have watch his progression through to be head of the supreme court this be not man give to make grand political gesture this be no wide eyed radical when he come up with an amendment to say that the purpose of the bill should be do in accordance with domestic and international law that make perfect sense it be not to be forget that the root of this legislation be to be find in supreme court judgment that cause enormous frustration in government circle and we do not forget that but obey the law be not an optional extra for any government even if what we be try to do here be to circumvent the scrutiny of the court to resist an amendment that say that decision maker should treat rwanda as safe unless present with credible evidence to the contrary simply defy any sense of logic the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry make extensive reference to the home office guidance on human right in rwanda her point be good but it be nonsense surely that in the home office people be beaver away work out the human right position in rwanda while in another office in the same building people be draft clause say that the people who will then make the decision should not allow to take any account of it that make no sense if we be serious about find solution to the problem and break the business model of the people trafficker the government would be take in the opposition the scottish nationalists ourselves and all party to try to find common way forward in fact they be do the opposite they be seek to manage the issue politically in such way as to increase division and not to build consensus in the time remain to they in government they will be able to win vote like this but they will not do anything to stop the traffic ultimately they will have to be replace by those who will rise to reject and oppose all of the lords amendment in the other place last week peer after peer speak of this bill as an outrageous affront to the law or international law with great respect there seem to be collective amnesia that it be parliament that be sovereign and that parliament secure sovereign authority over generation from what have previously be an absolute monarchy it probably stem from the glorious revolution of parliament for century now have have sovereign authority to pass any law whatever no law that parliament pass can be outside the law in our system it be parliament that be supreme despite the misnomer of the court that tony blair invent it be parliament that be supreme not lawyer or judge that be unlike the united states for example where judge can strike down law pass by congress as unconstitutional in fact the uk legislature could do the opposite of that and strike the supreme court down out of existence if such be parliament will that is after all what tony blair himself do when he abolish the year old principle of the law lords and the house of lords as our high court and create the supreme court just few year ago many think that be an act of constitutional vandalism and happen to agree but whether or not one do it be axiomatic that what blair do one of his successor can at least in theory undo that be the nature of our system as my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash say early parliament derive its authority from the people and that be why parliamentary sovereignty be so important it be not an aggrandisement the law be living fluid concept people change and people view change which be why it be right that the people elect representative in parliament can have sovereignty over decision that be make two hundred year ago draw graffiti on westminster bridge be an offence punishable by death now people can block ambulance on westminster bridge and receive no more than small fine the law have change in year and it be imperative that we bear in mind that it be fluid concept it have to keep up with the wish and will of the people the point be that society change and the law change with it and that be major advantage of the english common law system today the british people have elect leader such as my right hon friend the prime minister of this country who advocate policy of increase vigilance on immigration and the elect politician must be able to enact law in accordance with the wish of the people even if lawyer and member of the other place do not like it that be the very essence of democracy have work in the law all my life it be year since be call to the bar and know that the law be not the master of the people but servant of the people as be this house it must serve the wish of the british electorate and if necessary adapt accordingly the british people current wish on immigration be clear and the prime minister be right to enact they this be not just constitutional position nine people have die try to cross the english channel in small boat this year alone the late victim of the smuggling gang be seven year old girl whose overloaded boat capsize in french canal for this reason stop the boat be not just political imperative it be moral necessity only when those come to the uk illegally know that they can not stay will they stop risk their life and the life of other be sorry to say however that to labour and crossbench peer in the house of lords last week it seem to be an outrage to try to stop this trade in human misery by establish what would be an effective deterrent through the rwanda partnership notwithstanding the contribution of some member in the other place who be oppose this process it be clear to anyone who read the supreme court judgment of last year that the bill be the constitutionally appropriate response to it the judgment relate to the condition in rwanda at the time of the original challenge in june and lord reed the senior judge in the supreme court be explicit about the fact that the issue identify could be address in future in other word the supreme court explicitly invite ministers of the crown to remedy the problem that they have identify in their judgment and that be precisely what his majesty government have now do with treaty that be bind under the international law framework that labour and crossbench peer so admire nor do the bill oust the jurisdiction of the court that be another misapprehension judge will be able to consider human right claim and judicial review they will just do so after people have be send to rwanda unless of course claimant can prove that they will face real risk of serious harm in rwanda in which case they can stay in the uk while the appeal be hear order if the right hon and learn gentleman could mention the amendment now and again that would be very useful thank you very much mr deputy speaker that arrangement be entirely reasonable and as say at the beginning the amendment be relevant to this whole concept if one come to this country illegally one should not have the ability to repeatedly prevent one removal at vast expense to the taxpayer however because of labour vote that be no doubt whip by the leader of the opposition the house of lords defeat the government time on amendment seek to neuter the bill and ensure that no one be ever send to rwanda they do not vote down the bill and do not vote for these amendment because they want it to work they do so because they do not want it to work what none of those peer on the opposition benches do be provide an actual alternative to the rwanda partnership none of they could say how they would deter people from get into overloaded dinghy on the beach of northern france or prevent the death that will surely follow in vote against the bill the lords be therefore constitutionally legally and morally wrong and urge the house to overturn their amendment be grateful for the opportunity to take part in the debate this bill be an affront to the principle that human right be universal and belong to all of we by virtue of our humanity the amendment from the other place be an attempt to stop the government violate that principle and would argue undermine not just parliament but the court and the rule of law in the process despite unacceptable and unparliamentary pressure from the prime minister who urge peer to rush their scrutiny and simply go along with his dangerous authoritarian bill they have rightly inflict defeat on the government they have do so by large majority signal profound opposition to the prime minister deeply illiberal deeply inhumane rwanda legislation the home secretary motion to disagree be consistent with this government track record of cruelty towards people seek asylum we see another example of that very recently in the home office jaw drop admission that it do not routinely inform family member when asylum seeker die in home office care lord amendment table by lord coaker simply add maintain full compliance with domestic and international law to the purpose of the bill one might have imagine that that would not be up for debate and it be measure of how low this government have sink that they be oppose an amendment which simply say that their bill should comply with the rule of law something have think conservative members be mean to believe in in particular the amendment be need to stop the disapplication of the landmark human rights act something believe we should be proudly defend it be also need to protect interim measure vital human right tool under international law issue on an exceptional basis in extreme circumstance when individual face real risk of serious and irreversible harm the bill state that the parliament of the united kingdom be sovereign and that the validity of an act be unaffected by international law and we have hear great deal more of that from conservative members this afternoon think that ministers should stop misuse the concept of parliamentary sovereignty which be not embody by rid roughshod over the court let draw their attention to point make very clearly by professor mark elliot chair of the faculty of law at the university of cambridge as he explain parliament can be meaningfully sovereign only within functional legal and constitutional system and such system can only exist if its other component element be permit to play their proper part suggest that that be exactly the principle that the government be seek to trample over with the bill which bring to the way in which the government be attack parliamentary sovereignty by undermine the jurisdiction of the court lord amendment in the name of baroness chakrabarti be vital it would allow our court to play their proper part to hear evidence and scrutinise the legality of government decision allow our system to protect individual from risk to life or inhuman or degrading treatment likewise lords amendment and at least allow for the presumption in the bill that rwanda be safe to be rebut without these amendment the bill direct court to ignore the fact that be in front of they the amendment be modest reprieve for fact and evidence in what remain thoroughly vile bill it be extraordinary that the government can be so fearful of evidence why would they not want to look at the evidence before they let refer they to the recently publish world report which deal with human right in rwanda and make pretty grim reading it state commentator journalist opposition activist and other speak out on current affair and criticize public policy in rwanda continue to face abusive prosecution enforce disappearance and have at time die under unexplained circumstance also urge member to consider how constitutionally and legally astonish the bill be the joint committee on human rights have be explicit about how extraordinary it be state that require the court to conclude that rwanda be safe even though the evidence have be assess by the uk high court to establish that it be not be remarkable thing for piece of legislation to do that bring to lords amendment and which stand in the name of lord hope of craighead the former deputy president of the supreme court there have be much discussion about they but they require monitoring of the safety of rwanda while accept the assertion that the treaty make rwanda safe let we suppose for moment that we suspend our disbelief and our notice of all the evidence now that suggest rwanda be not safe even if it be safe how on earth can we be legislate that it will be into the future for any degree of indefinite time much in this bill be an affront to common sense but that seem to be in league of its own fact change and when they do we need to change our view of those fact to do anything less be move towards moment of madness want to be clear that although will vote to uphold these lords amendment because they be an improvement on this dreadful bill maintain my view that seek to legislate by assertion that rwanda be safe be as dangerous as it be ridiculous the government can not sign quick treaty one week and legislate the next to make country safe when the high court in the land have say just the opposite the fact on the ground be what matter and these amendment say that the fact should be monitor what kind of government would oppose that to conclude will vote to uphold lords amendment to because they make this bill slightly less constitutionally transgressive and inhumane the home secretary motion to disagree with the lords be laughable come just day after he have be exploit the desperation of vulnerable people by offer they to go to rwanda voluntarily amend or not the bill remain grotesque waste of money that be neither practical nor strategic it be no less than piece of performative cruelty from die administration leave aside the decision of the court on lords amendment we be in danger of reverse the work that this house have put in to ensure the protection of victim of modern slavery and traffic remove the amendment make they vulnerable again particularly to re traffic can not for the life of understand why there be not support from the government for lords amendment which merely assert the decision maker opportunity to assess the impact on the physical and mental health of the individual and their potential to be re trafficked thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention and he be absolutely right in what he say it be ironic that by refuse these amendment the government be in sense go back on pledge and commitment they have make on try to uphold issue relate to human trafficking this bill be hugely damaging on so many level other have speak about amendment to provide at least some possible protection for unaccompanied child or for victim of modern slavery and those at the high risk of harm if remove to rwanda we must consider what vote against those amendment mean just as we must do in respect of lords amendment which relate to the people in afghanistan who have do so much for we put their own life at risk for our government and our country on the idea that we would simply send they off to rwanda the right hon gentleman have already make powerful intervention about what that would do for people who be already so vulnerable sum up with message that hope that peer in the other place will consider it be of course right and fundamental that the house of lords should act in accordance with its subordinate position in relation to this elect house of commons that be the usual way in which we proceed for the other place to override the commons the bar must be an extraordinary and profound attack on the very fabric and operation of our constitutional democracy regret to conclude that this bill be just that and so the other place would be well within its right indeed this be its responsibility to uphold the amendment it have already put in place this bill be demean and degrade both houses by ignore the rule of law that we have pass furthermore the bill seek to legislate fact and prevent court from consider they fix the fact on which the law be to be apply be the kind of think that dangerous conspiracy be base on that way lie authoritarianism urge those in the other place to put stop to this bill and urge everyone in this house to vote in favour of the amendment tonight note your strong exhortation to address the amendment mr deputy speaker and will address they in turn it be tempting to get into debate about whether the bill offend the rule of law the rule of law be use as an absolute term but it be in fact political term it be an important principle that underlie much of our constitution but it be sometimes misuse and elevate in way that do not do it or the debate justice inevitably we have have wide discussion about the safety of rwanda as country and about the geopolitic but that miss the point the point be whether we can be satisfied that the rwandan government be meet the obligation they agree to in the treaty of late that treaty be underpin by government command paper and be in effect the basis of the government answer to the exam question put to they by their lordship in the supreme court in the other place lord howard of lympne speak powerfully about the need for the arm of the constitution to respect each other and entirely agree with he on that have say the same here in debate on this issue we be perhaps not in the place that constitutionalist like want to be in but none the less we be deal with judgment of the supreme court base on the merit of the case and the test that it be allow to apply be there be risk of breach of the european convention of human right or in this case more risk of refoulement as set out under the refugee convention the supreme court decide that there be risk and the government have rightly try to take action to fill that gap simply ask the minister be he satisfied that the helpful step outline by their lordship international agreements committee in its report of january be be undertake refer to those nine point that ministers in the other place be press on repeatedly by among other lord carlile of berriew who make the point powerfully will not recite the nine step but they relate to make sure that rwanda process for deal with claim be fair transparent and in accordance with the treaty that it enter into it be important that the government and the minister address that point lord amendment just add more potential justiciability and legal argument to clause that as have say on other occasion despise because it be full of declaratory law at good and it create lot of legal opportunity for my colleague in the profession declare an interest of course do not think that we can perfect the clause by add lords amendment however lords amendment and seem to have force because if we be to go down this road of use deeming provision it be vital that we do not end up in position where the law go so far ahead of reality say through rwanda failure to carry out its treaty obligation or its slowness to do so that we create that legal fiction that lot of we be rightly worried about be therefore minded to support lords amendment and be grateful to my right hon and learn friend for allow to intervene before he move off lords amendment and as he know share his concern about the artificial finality that the bill draft present when it come to the treaty do he agree that the problem with amendment and be that they give all the authority to the monitoring committee they allow it to determine that there have not be adequate compliance with the treaty and under the amendment that automatically feed through to statement that rwanda be no long safe country under the rubric of the rest of the bill that decision should remain with the house of commons and the house of lords not with the monitoring committee my right hon and learn friend make powerful point the amendment be capable of perfection the suggestion that think make on report be that the bill should not to come into force until minister of the crown be satisfied that rwanda have meet its treaty obligation both internationally and domestically take his point more can be do but there be force in their lordship pursue that point so that we marry up the reality with what we want to achieve legally unless that be do be minded to support lords amendment and because be yet to be satisfied that we be in position where deeming clause although not unprecedented they have be use on number of occasion or unconstitutional be reflective of the reality the lords amendment relate to clause complicate the position that clause be clearly draft to deal with individual case and do not think that we should upset that lord amendment and do not take matter significantly far however lords amendment and have some force exemption relate to modern slavery should be clear we have lead the world in our modern slavery legislation and have proud record on it that work be lead by my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may and other in their lordship house it would be unfortunate to say the least to end up with the bill rid coach and horse through our important provision on modern slavery be sure that be not the intention of my colleague on the front bench finally on the afghan provision both my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel and be in the trench work on that issue back in the summer of be help to get judge out of afghanistan while she be work day and night to ensure that we save people who have risk their life for our way of life take her point and in fact would go far although expect the government to be sensible and sensitive to the position of any future afghan refugee and not put they into this scheme it seem to that we would lose nothing by accept amendment for the reason that have give the lords amendment be curate egg as all lords amendment will be but there be time when it be important that point be make be afraid that this be one of those occasion when will make that point the democratic unionist party support the bill wish it to come to fruition and hop that it achieve its objective will not rehearse all the reason why which have be give plenty of time in other debate but we must tackle the criminal gang we can not go on with the pressure and cost that mass illegal immigration put on society the government and the taxpayer for that reason we will oppose most of the lords amendment as the minister and other speaker have point out many of the amendment be design to weaken the bill undermine it and ensure that it do not work so that we remain with the old flawed system that we have be try to put aside the minister say that the government oppose the lords amendment because they do not want the bill weaken and he be right but the bill be already weaken in respect of one part of the united kingdom seek assurance from he how do he come to the conclusion that push the bill through will safeguard all part of the united kingdom against illegal immigration that be be channel through different part of it the government promise in safeguard the union that the bill will apply to the whole of the united kingdom but that be write in full knowledge that follow court judgment in northern ireland the bill could not apply there because of section of the european union withdrawal act and article of the windsor framework two more court judgment since then have make it quite clear that because of article the bill can not apply to northern ireland where the full weight of eu law and the full protection of the european convention on human right and the european charter of fundamental right apply that mean that many part of the bill will be disapplie in northern ireland there be three court ruling on this the government know what be in the windsor framework the withdrawal agreement and the withdrawal act yet they continue with the argument that despite all that the bill apply to northern ireland would like to hear from the minister where that assurance come from give that he know the term of the legislation and the windsor framework and about the three court judgment from october february and the end of february if northern ireland become the weak spot the policy become meaningless people think the boat be go to come from france across the sea to southern ireland on hour journey and people will not come up through to northern ireland but it must be remember that of city in the united kingdom belfast already have second high number of illegal immigrant per of population there be already channel through the republic into northern ireland and then of course into england that need to be address because promise have be make in government deal and because of how that could undermine the whole immigration policy of course if northern ireland do become that channel the real danger be that we finish up not just with border for good but with passport control for people move from northern ireland order could you mention some of the amendment as well yes be do so mr deputy speaker the point be make be that we will support the government in reject lords amendment to because they weaken the bill but the government must recognise that their own inaction be also weaken the bill be surprised at the attitude that the government have adopt to lords amendment since the policy be design to assure people that the government have get on top of illegal immigration would have think they would have welcome the opportunity to publish daily the number of people who have be remove from the united kingdom in fact would have think they might have do ken livingstone put banner on the building across the river and publish daily this be how many people we have remove be the reality that the government know that the bill will not have the want effect and that the publication of such information would be an embarrassment we support that amendment because we believe that there should be very public way of judge the success of the policy really can not understand the government attitude to lords amendment either we have duty to those who serve with the army in afghanistan at difficult time put their life in danger and who be now in danger of lose their life under the brutal taliban regime which want to take revenge it be not that people could use such provision to sneak their way into the united kingdom we have good record on those who serve the army they and their family be at risk and surely we have duty to they remember speak to people from northern ireland who serve in afghanistan they speak glowingly of the folk who interpret for they and the folk who give they background knowledge supply they with information go out with they on patrol daily and so on we have duty to those people can not understand why the government would resist lords amendment we will certainly be support it because we believe we have that obligation would like to hear from the minister how the promise make in paragraph of the safeguard the union deal will be deliver in northern ireland give that court have judge and rule that the bill can not apply in northern ireland if it can not apply in northern ireland be the government aware of the consequence for northern ireland of be far isolate from the rest of the united kingdom it be always pleasure to follow the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson agree with much of what he say but will differ from he on the one or two amendment he plan to support it be worth remember the purpose of the bill it be about deal with one of the knotty problem in illegal migration policy which be what we do about those who leave safe and democratic country to come to the uk as choice who we then can not return to their home country either because of the domestic policy of the country which the minister will know about or because it be country we be realistically not go to be able to engage with on immigration removal then they seek to take advantage of our asylum system in many case that be the core of the people trafficker business model these people can include those who have have lawful residence in another safe democratic country but then come to this country and apply for refugee status for the bill have to be about deliver process that break the people smuggler business model my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright be pleased to see he in his place really sum it up these amendment be not about make the bill work well or get this process in well place they be about create route to challenge delay and block up listen to the point he make such as on permanence of course parliament be always free to take different view on legislation present no parliament can bind another constitutionally so future parliament could take view that rwanda be no long safe but for now we be quite entitled to take view as to whether it be particularly with the treaty obligation and the work be do we can say that rwanda be safe for refugee to be transfer to the core of the bill be about work with another country that be an expert in resettlement and be able to provide for people with genuine safety need or who be seek safety it be not about allow the continuation of the idea that if someone pay trafficker they can choose where that safety need be meet that is here in the united kingdom lord amendment allow range of challenge to the idea that rwanda be not safe again look at the fact that rwanda be work with the unhcr on refugee resettlement if it be inherently dangerous to take someone to rwanda or there be massive danger of refoulement on to country where they would face persecution that system could not exist it be perfectly reasonable that we can come to our own agreement with rwanda that will be effective and respected and that we can rely on in define the country as safe sadly do not have time to go into all the element touch on in the debate such as the issue we have with our age assessment system but it be similarly perfectly reasonable to say that with new process come in we can take view lot of challenge be raise up not because they will ultimately succeed but because they delay removal be go to disagree little bit with what the right hon member for east antrim and other say about amendment first it say refer to all individual in strict interpretation of that we would list everyone name and address which would clearly not be appropriate at all neither would it be appropriate to list the timetable for the removal of individual from this country that would involve go into publication of datum that the government would not normally go into for fairly obvious reason the idea that we will not get report and constant commentary on how the process be go without amend the bill do not stand up like my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel work on op pitting and see the work we do to get people out of afghanistan yes we do need to look at how we can unblock some of the arap process but lot of that be to do with find place to settle here in the uk it be one of the big issue with many of our resettlement scheme one of the great success of the ukrainian scheme be people come forward but with the afghan one we be reliant in many case on local council to offer space which unsurprisingly give the well know housing pressure not many rush to do there be debate to be have there but it be not resolve by amend this bill and provide another route to challenge or make claim when there be likelihood that that route will be use by those who perhaps never have anything to do with our force but see it as way to not be transfer to rwanda do find interesting some of the counterintuitive argument we have hear from the opposition benches that this be all bit of gimmick and be not go to work if that be the case why waste time amend the bill why not let it go through let the government get their legislation and then spend the rest of the year say look it do work we know what the real fear be it be that if the bill go through this plan will work the bill can be perfectly credible and go forward some of the objection we have hear sit with and go against the fact that the unhcr itself be take people to rwanda in very large number as have already be mention without the bill and without it be an effective bill that is bill without these amendment what be the plan what be on offer to try to break this fundamental part of the people smuggler business model we be tell about crack down on gang but my hon friend the member for bosworth dr evans rightly point out that there have be lot of prosecution arrest and conviction already and he ask how many more the opposition be propose there be no real answer the answer be that their opposition be just soundbite nothing else it be like the claim that all we need to do be walk in the door and we will get great deal out of france well good luck with that know from my own dealing with authority on the continent that it be not just case of walk in the door make demand and suddenly get everything we want as be say early the amendment may be very elegant and well word but at the end of the day they be nothing but wreck amendment intend to obfuscate the process bung it up delay it and reopen route to challenge that the bill be specifically look to shut down the bill look to transfer people to perfectly safe country that be an expert in resettlement work with other group on resettlement and be perfectly able to work with the united kingdom parliament be perfectly able and right to take the view that it be safe to do so we have all hear the admonition about speak to the amendment but it be worth reflect on the absence of any amendment in lieu on the amendment paper during early stage of the bill there be star chamber the five family proposition to strengthen the bill and all kind of dark muttering about what might happen if it be not strengthen sufficiently but the bill clear this house without any amendment now consensus appear to have break out on the conservative back benches that the bill do not in fact need any further change and should remain unamended so it do not need strengthen after all perhaps that be because this be bill that nobody really want all it have do be create problem for the government and the prime minister that do not have to exist in the first place the bill create significant new precedent undermine establish principle and convention and move the uk away from framework and structure of international law that have protect our freedom and human right for nearly year since the end of the second world war it be not really the safety of rwanda bill it be the safety of the prime minister bill it have all be design to try to keep certain element of his back benches happy and on that test it seem to have fail just as it have fail in practically every other criterion it could be assess against the evidence of that be before we in the amendment that have be make on cross party basis by member of the house of lords as we have hear in all the opposition speech today many of these be completely reasonable sensible test and requirement if the government be genuinely confident about the effectiveness of their policy and the safety of rwanda as place for the deportation of asylum seeker they should be able to accept the lords amendment without difficulty the amendment to clause propose by lord coaker and lord hope of craighead simply lie out the criterion by which rwanda should be judge safe and on the government own term base on the treaty that they have sign agree with the point make by the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael about the significance of lord hope add his name to the amendment declare an interest because many year ago he confer an undergraduate degree on when he be chancellor of the university of strathclyde the amendment to clause in some way get to the heart of the debate and the issue at stake in the bill the debate be not really about whether rwanda be safe in general term as say on second reading visit rwanda as have number of member who have speak in with the commonwealth parliamentary association it be beautiful country with huge potential its people have have to live through incredibly difficult circumstance for wealthy tourist who fly in go on safari and stay in nice hotel or those who go on select committee or cpa visit rwanda be safe and welcome country however citizen who speak up too loudly with question about the regime who ask why international observer have be unable to report that presidential election have be free or fair or who belong to the lgbt community in that country or rwandan citizen live in london under the protection of the metropolitan police because they be be stalk by their country intelligence service might not find rwanda quite as safe and welcoming the question be not whether rwanda be generally safe which be how the fcdo official travel guidance describe the country it will be interesting whether it will update that guidance on the basis of the bill the issue be whether it be safe for asylum seeker and even then not for asylum seeker generally as some amorphous mass but every individual asylum seeker who might be send there everyone personal circumstance be different everyone story be unique as the refuweegee charity say we all fae somewhere lord amendment recognise that and provide for consideration and review of individual claim and case those kind of check and balance ought to be expect in any kind of make system especially one that make fundamental choice about the life of the individual concern but minister do not like to individualise the issue they have lose sight of or perhaps they have never really care about the wellbeing of the human being at the centre of this debate last week the minister kindly accept an invitation to visit glasgow something none of his predecessor have be prepare to do hope that when he come he will meet and listen to some of my constituent who be support by the maryhill integration network refuweegee glasgow afghan united and other organisation that work with refugee and asylum seeker to make they welcome in the city he will see how people who have come here on small boat on the back of lorry or through other irregular mean have not do so for purely economic reason they have come flee war climate change persecution and many other situation barely imaginable to many of we who live in relative comfort and safety in scotland and in the uk all they want be to be safe and to be able to contribute to their new community and society there be nothing good about the bill it should be scrap in its entirety it be unnecessary unworkable and unloved by all side of the conservative party and the house the lords amendment provide something in the way of mitigation and the house should support each of they tonight hope that it have the chance to divide on each of they too the government their back benchers and everyone else who support the bill ought to be make to work for it if they think walk around the lobby for two hour be tough they should try get on small boat or on the back of lorry and see how they feel about that if the government use their majority to send the amendment back the lords ought to think carefully about how their amendment in lieu might achieve similar aim and not simply cave at the end of the first round of ping pong the bill be not in the government manifesto or even in the king speech so there be no convention principle or anything else stop the lords from continue to insist on version of their amendment we on the snp benches be not supporter of an unelected second chamber but if member on the government benches and more pertinently on the official opposition benches think that an unelected house of lords be good idea and have role to play in the uk constitution they ought not be prepared to see the lords simply cave in on this kind of legislation opposition member should ensure that their colleague in the house of lords continue to hold the government to account in the way that they think the uk constitution ought to work in reality all this be get we far away from the snp vision of an independent scotland with an open and welcome asylum and immigration system and the more that the government and the official opposition continue to push that divergence the close that independent scotland will come order intend to call the minister to wind up at no later than pm expect vote start at pm or before those who have participate in the debate should make their way to the chamber now mr shannon be not put the clock on you but ask you to resume your seat by pm it be real pleasure to speak in this debate mr deputy speaker thank right hon and hon member for their comment this be no doubt contentious issue on which we all have opinion but ensure safety for all be everyone main priority my right hon friend the member for east antrim sammy wilson set out the position of the democratic unionist party want to make three point in the next five minute the first relate to lords amendment and those who help we in afghanistan in february meet an afghan national who serve alongside one of my constituent in an army role do not want to go into any more detail about that other than to say that that man and his four child be under threat in pakistan have do everything in my power as an mp along with other mp to try to get he home we have get he house and job the hon member for torbay kevin foster say that all they be get be place but we have get he house and job in company in newtownards we will get his child integrate into school because we have do that already with syrian refugee we take they in and they be establish and do not want to leave my first question to the minister about ensure that we can do that secondly refer back to my early intervention about the northern ireland court ruling legal decision have be take in belfast and the minister clearly respond that it will be challenge wish the minister well on that challenge and hope that the ruling can be overturn if it be northern ireland will be the same as every other part of the united kingdom if not we be clearly different hope the minister will come back to on that thirdly say early that be the chair of the appg for international freedom of religion or belief which be an important issue for and for many mp in this house and some member of the house of lords we have member mp and peer which indicate the importance of the issue ensure that religion be respect be so important to and other be go to speak to some of the lords amendment as everyone have do in their own way clause would require decision maker conclusively to treat rwanda as safe country if that presumption be make it be crucial that the same presumption apply to how member of certain community will be treat once there we can have all the freedom of religious belief in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland but if they do not have it in rwanda the whole object of the exercise have be defeat seek that assurance lord amendment would far allow decision maker to determine whether rwanda can be deem safe country for certain individual or group of similar person be pleased that this protection have be address because it could protect certain group of people of particular religion to ensure their safety the only concern be that if there be more scope for grant injunction that delay removal we could see ourselves in similar position of long list of delayed home office decision that could take month to be conclude be pleased that protection be be consider for victim of slavery or human trafficking give that victim be bring to the uk involuntarily their circumstance should be assess differently to ensure their safety may not have parent with they so special provision must be in place in the short time that the minister have ask he to ensure that protection be give to they so that they be not take advantage of that be critical it be always important to debate these issue thoroughly as they have be by member on all side of the chamber with slightly different opinion other people life be in our hand and these issue be paramount there be no doubt that we have problem with illegal migration in this country as my right hon friend the member for east antrim say no one in the chamber from whatever party can ignore that issue but there be exceptional circumstance for some people and consideration must be give to they no matter where they be be deport to it must be safe place for those with specific religious belief they must be protect if we can protect they and their freedom human right and religious belief wherever they may be that will be step in the right direction for as the chair of the appg for international freedom of religion or belief more importantly it will be step in the right direction for those people who be make the choice to go to another country may start by thank every single right hon and hon member who have contribute during the course of this debate it have be detail thorough and constructive and be grateful to each and every one who have contribute shall start in reverse order with the hon member for strangford jim shannon who be so often leave until the end it be delightful to see he without time limit on the clock at least will come back to his point on amendment at the end as number of hon member have mention it on the question of article of the agreement do not cover unaccompanied child know that he will be partially reassure by that on his important comment on religion and faith point he to article and of the constitution of rwanda know that he will look at they and hope he will find reassurance there turn to the penultimate speaker the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady to whom always listen carefully he have renew his invitation and accept once again confirm that look forward to my visit with he to glasgow go back to the beginning of the debate perhaps one of the most instructive part be the exchange between the shadow minister the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock and my hon friend the member for torbay kevin foster it contain the foreshadowing of comment make time and again by my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton who be in his place and who repeatedly make the point that it be incumbent upon anyone who disagree with this policy to come up with their own solution to the problem of how we should deal with people who enter the country with no legitimate credible case for claim asylum and be grant safe haven but who can not be return to their home country that point be make powerfully today by my hon friend the member for torbay but once again answer come there none agree with the open remark of my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright and with hopefully more than just the first half of his speech but certainly the first half of it he characterise this debate this bill and this issue incredibly well and encourage member to turn to his speech agree with his assessment of amendment and he be right to say that they would transfer authority on to the monitor committee rather than on to parliament which be the right place for it to be he tempt to delve far into issue that he rightly acknowledge be not strictly part of this debate at least not today but will consider they carefully as he know be grateful to he for his contribution on the last occasion that the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss and exchange view on this bill undermine her credential by not disagree with each and every one of her submission will start to make amend today and pick she up on two issue on the emergency transit mechanism it be treaty it be an agreement that have be sign by the african union the unhcr and the government of rwanda it be important it be support and back by the eu to the tune of million and have be warmly welcome by the eu ambassador with word that do not have time to repeat now but read they out at the outset of the debate agree with the hon lady when she say that the amendment be design to undermine the purpose of the bill she be very plain and open about that in stark contrast to those on the labour benches my hon friend the member for rother valley alexander stafford also make that point powerfully as do the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas they confirm that these be wreck amendment if anyone want to put stop to the bill they should support these amendment my hon friend the members for stone sir william cash and for rother valley talk about sovereignty of parliament my hon friend the member for stone talk about clear and unambiguous language and cite the famous paragraph of the supreme court judgment he also cite lord hoffmann agree with he when he speak about the strength of our unwritten constitution can gently push back on something that the chair of the select committee the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson say my hon friend the members for gloucester richard graham and for rother valley tackle the deterrent effect powerfully at the outset the deterrent effect be there albania have already show that number have drop by over can also gently push back with she on scrutiny and respectfully point out once

friend the member for corby welcome have appear twice before the committee in quick succession the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry speak about her visit to rwanda may gently say that disagree fundamentally with her assessment suggest that the evidence need to be look at in the round it be powerful thing that evidence have be put forward that represent the spectrum of view but it need to be look at in the round in relation to rwanda disagree with she because we on this side be confident in the government of rwanda commitment to implement this partnership we be clear that rwanda be safe country there be some instructive and powerful intervention on this from my hon friend the member for hartlepool jill mortimer be also grateful to my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson for her speech have just be to rwanda and for give her powerful assessment of where we be be grateful to my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel

question propose that this house do now webb it be huge privilege to lead tonight adjournment debate on the cadet expansion programme and be grateful to the minister for respond to it almost exactly year ago when be young army cadet in guildford the combined cadet force at my school deploy to okehampton for its easter camp during that week cadet participate in night navigation exercise across the notorious dartmoor give the cold weather and awful terrain that would have be challenge at any time but we have barely leave okehampton when thick fog engulf we to the point that you could not see your hand in front of your face sense the danger the three of we in my group use all the training that we have be give not just to get off the moor but to complete the exercise together the young cadet alongside be hamish walker and graham atkinson will never forget the experience anyone who be familiar with military service will know that heighten sense of vigilance and excitement when travel cross country at night totally confident in what the map and compass be tell we and meticulously count our pace we work together to double check our navigation and agree every decision we make this be long before sat nav we be utterly blind because of the fog but we trust our instinct training and the compass needle and that potent combination of teamwork resilience inform judgement competitive spirit and confidence that one get with military service see we succeed against the odd even as year old kid this however be typical of what cadet still do whether abseil down dam building shelter learn to ski or shoot escape from capsize canoe prepare an ambush or cooking in the field the skill acquire as an army cadet for five year at school and for further three year in the university officer training corp be pivotal to everything be today while the cadet movement do not exist to recruit people for military career it be so formative for that it give the skill to thrive at the royal military academy sandhurst which now represent as the local mp and throughout year military career my response to almost everything that have be ask of since leave the cadet probably have its foundation in my time with the cadet so it have make huge difference to personally what of the cadet force themselves the ministry of defence sponsor five different type of cadet force the sea cadet corp the volunteer cadet corps the army cadet force and the air training corp be single service in nature not tie to school but the fifth the combined cadet force offer more tri service balance and be host in school with adult volunteer often come from the teaching staff all these unit be voluntary organisation that offer challenging and enjoyable activity for young people and prepare they to play an active role in their community while develop life skill while they do model their tradition and ethos on their parent service they be not actually part of hm force and do not of course have any formal military role the sea cadet consist of over young people and adult volunteer in unit across town city and port undertake activity such as sailing boat and coastal navigation the volunteer cadet corp offer something very similar but be more tightly connected to naval family it consist of around cadet and volunteer locate in eight naval basis across southern england and scotland the army cadet force have over cadet and adult volunteer and it celebrate its anniversary in the fourth of the non school unit be the air training corp which consist of over cadet and volunteer staff in over squadron across the uk encourage participant to take an active interest in aviation and the royal air force commend the hon gentleman for bring forward the debate we speak beforehand the school cadet expansion programme in northern ireland have go from success to success with kilkeel high school in the constituency neighbour my strangford constituency become the new cadet force this week pupil from school across northern ireland enter the cyber skill challenge competition which be fantastic do the hon gentleman agree that northern ireland be very much set the target for other cadet force across the united kingdom to try to match up to do he also welcome the fact that almost as many roman catholics be now join the cadet force in northern ireland as protestants thank the hon member for his intervention and completely agree what be happen in northern ireland be an exemplar for the cadet movement it be quite something that we have balance between catholic and protestant child in these unit this be about cohesion and community and what be happen over there be commendable as for the combined cadet force unit exist in over school across the uk traditionally they be the preserve of independent school with over of they host detachment but there be now at least unit in state school too they offer young student broad range of exciting adventurous and educational activity that complement the normal school curriculum during the evening at weekend and during the holiday like the other cadet unit they help to develop personal responsibility leadership teamwork and self discipline in my view it be no coincidence that many young cadet emerge to be highly successful in their choose career field in berkshire be proud that we have strong pedigree with the military presence there could again mention the royal military academy at sandhurst the headquarters of brigade at hermitage the household cavalry regiment and the battalion of the coldstream guards in windsor rifles in reading and so much more but really want to highlight the royal county of berkshire army cadet force this currently support over cadet and adult volunteer in detachment many of which see on remembrance sunday and at special event alongside the lord lieutenant give big shout out for platoon in bracknell which do so much locally train and play hard in equal measure and always look so smart while we do not sadly have sea cadet unit in my constituency bracknell be home to squadron of the air training corps meet several of the cadet recently and it never cease to amaze just how much be on offer it be even possible for cadet to go fly and set themselves up to gain pilot licence to anyone watch from bracknell forest say please do consider join the army cadet force or air training corps locally it be real opportunity as for the combined cadet force there be two detachment in my constituency wellington college have an establish military presence and proud history of service while have not yet be invite to visit it be good one by reputation at brakenhale school in bracknell have watch with wonder as fledgling detachment have evolve under the superb leadership and vision of both second lieutenant bury and second lieutenant gildersleve get that off the ground from virtually nothing be quite an achievement and the detachment serve as an exemplar for the cadet expansion programme with over pupil in bracknell now be give the opportunity to wear uniform train with the british army get adventure training and learn life skill that they may otherwise not have do can not commend brakenhale school enough for everything that it be do and be look forward to the annual inspection later this year so what of the cadet expansion programme itself it be first launch on armed forces day in june by the then prime minister david cameron with the aim of deliver new cadet unit in english state fund school by september this target be reach six month early in march and follow that achievement the government commit an extra million from libor fine to far increase the number of cadet unit in school across the uk bring the total to by phase be now under way and the minister be sure to provide progress report later the cadet expansion programme be part of the government aim of promote the military ethos in school instill value in young people that will help they to get

what have already be achieve in the private sector state school that have set up cadet unit be offer significant benefit to their young people there be also benefit to the school and the local community headteacher report that they have see significant improvement in attendance and behaviour attainment commitment self confidence and discipline and that relationship between staff and student have improve the sense of pride that some student feel be also palpable and give that the government be champion of aspiration opportunity ambition and enterprise want to see this programme develop far and fast so that all pupil irrespective of their background can have well access to these superb opportunity before close want to highlight number of area where feel that we can do well first and foremost it would be massively positive for all our adult volunteer to be give financial incentive for their time not only would that be positive for recruitment and retention but it would send clear signal that the ministry of defence be take the broad benefit more seriously our volunteer be the lifeblood of the cadet movement and it would be remiss of not to formally thank and pay tribute to everyone who run our detachment for their huge contribution we should invest more in our cadet infrastructure repair our old hall build new one and provide well facility such as range and accommodation it go without say that high operating cost should be mitigate that more transport should be make available that more opportunity should be provide to train alongside our regular force and that well adventure training and more update equipment should be make available while it be considerable outlay for the ministry of defence to provide uniform weapon and personal kit it should be possible for serviceable ex military equipment that would otherwise be dispose of to be provide to cadet unit close tie up with regular and reserve unit through the affiliation process should help to ensure that great localise support be available for those detachment that need it lastly as someone who get so much out of the combined cadet force and officers training corps be always hugely privileged to visit and inspect local cadet unit in berkshire surrey and hampshire particularly when serve as command officer in aldershot and at sandhurst our cadet be our future and whether they choose to join his majesty force or not their service in uniform will leave lasting legacy throughout their lifetime and their personal skill will be call upon as be mine also wish to thank the many organisation that continue to enable the cadet movement not least our single service branch such as the cadet branch at army headquarters regional command in aldershot which form part of home command the national cadet training centre at frimley park which do so much to train our adult volunteer and our reserve force and cadet association or rfca which support our cadet force so well behind the scene indeed today be wear the distinctive tie of the south east reserve forces and cadet association which have work alongside for many year ask they to please keep up the great work locally conclude by pay tribute to the other youth movement across the uk that do so much to promote the essential value that we have commend this evening they be far too numerous to list so hope that can be forgive for not do so but we have the police cadet st john ambulance cadet the scout and guide movement venture scout youth sport club young crusaders religious club breakfast and after school club environmental group online network voluntary organisation and at least more establish group than can easily be find with quick search online be often tell by parent and teacher in my constituency that there be nothing for young people to do locally that the government be not do enough that that be key reason for antisocial behaviour and that many be bored my answer be usually the while there be always more that we can and must do locally and nationally we should also be proud of what we have not least in our cadet force extend such opportunity more broadly across our society be complete no brainer for so many reason and hope that the minister will not disappoint we what pleasure it be to respond to the contribution of my hon and gallant friend the member for bracknell james sunderland this evening hope that we will be able to reflect on huge success in our country it be wonderful thing for our community to have cadet have see they in my constituency and they be an important part of the local fabric support occasion from remembrance sunday to armed forces day and beyond we be lucky to have they pay particular tribute to the volunteer who make that possible so many of our institution have be afraid suffer as result of the pandemic and it have be extremely difficult for they to get go again yet cadet seem to have bounce back and be flourish and the reason be that there be people who be prepared to give up their time and shoulder fair amount of inconvenience to serve their community in that way we all owe they great deal the benefit that our cadet programme offer to young people and society as whole be well known and well rehearse agree wholeheartedly that the mod sponsor cadet force provide brilliant opportunity for our young people they have be catalogue by academic from the university of northampton to whom be grateful for their rigorous appraisal which give scientific objectivity to what we all understand instinctively to be the case namely that cadet be force for good participation in cadet have be show to build character self discipline and self reliance it improve teamworking problem solving leadership and social skill it provide boost for physical and mental health benefit that be sure my hon friend will know about from his time as cadet which he describe so well have to say that my time be not quite as happy as his remember join the air cadet briefly be tell be go to fly aircraft after about two month it dawn on that that be not go to happen it would be march up and down for as long as could put up with it which be not very long have to say that part company from the cadet much soon than my hon friend but there it be be sure it benefit on some level headteacher of school that have establish cadet unit report that their cadet have improve attendance and academic attainment as well as behaviour and self confidence some headteacher use cadet as central part of their strategy to reduce exclusion cadet programme be also gateway to new skill new qualification and even employment they be also valuable way of make young people aware of the further opportunity available in defence and defence relate industry although as my hon friend make clear cadet force be not mean to be recruit tool as our military footprint have shrink however cadet have assume an even more important role in at least provide some sort of presence in many community where otherwise there would be none they benefit the whole of society by build link between different community boost social mobility and strengthen young people resilience to become involve in antisocial behaviour criminality and even extremism in short join the cadet be springboard to success as well as be powerful engine for social mobility and level up the cadet expansion programme be joint ministry of defence and department for education initiative to expand cadet participation in school it have be fantastic success since its launch by the then prime minister year ago by march ahead of schedule the government reach their target of establish new combine cadet force unit in state secondary school in england in november again ahead of schedule we reach our further target of establish new cadet unit across the united report march vol correction fund with million from libor fine the expansion programme benefit many school in less affluent area to give renew impetus to the programme the government have by this time outline further aspiration to increase the number of cadet in school unit to by april however cadet unit require significant amount of personal commitment from school leader and volunteer and in spite of success about of the unit establish since have fail often as result of change to school leadership or priority that be pity but it in no way detract from the leadership and drive of school team that have advance the cadet programme to whom pay tribute as we approach april although cadet number in school have increase by since april to more than it be clear that covid have have an impact on this as on so much of our national life and that we will not reach our aspiration within the challenge timeframe that we set however it be not only the direct impact of the pandemic that have slow progress in addition to cadet activity be halt or limit by covid restriction participation have be affect by the result change in school priority with many understandably reorientate themselves from extra curricular activity to prioritise catch up on lose learning give this context the fact that we have already achieve of our ambition to have cadet in school be great credit to every individual and school involve in our expansion programme we have also make progress on number of other front to provide the great support for school cadet unit that we can in the last year we have develop combined cadet force engagement and communication framework we have work with the single service cadet force to improve the delivery model and have extend funding for regional school cadet expansion officer accord to report produce by academic at the university of northampton more than of headteacher survey consider their cadet unit to be good investment for their school and whopping report an improvement in the resilience of participant most recent estimate have calculate the cost of participation at per cadet and call that fantastic value for money investment in their future our future and the future of our country however member do not have to take my word for it the academic who conduct the study conclude that school base cadet unit be deliver excellent value for money as well they should give that the estimate of the institute for public policy research be that the cost of just one school exclusion be one impressive thing about the cadet force in my constituency be that there be as many young girl there as young boy whether we be talk about the army sea or air force cadet it be encouraging to see that and know that the minister would like that too be the government and the minister try to promote that absolutely do as the proud father of five daughter each of whom have be involve at some level in the cadet can certainly endorse the hon gentleman remark be impressed all the time by the number of young woman engage in the cadet and look to future in defence although of course this be not recruiting exercise the cadet force be increasingly female in its composition and that have to be positive thing remain determined to do all can to ensure that we continue to grow the number of cadet in our school as we recover from the pandemic we must meet our aspiration as soon as possible so that school such as brakenhale school in the constituency of my hon friend the member for bracknell can continue to flourish the school programme be of course complementary to the very successful community cadet force to which he refer pay tribute to the very active unit in my constituency and to the volunteer who sustain they these community cadet force be as popular as ever with our young people the number mirror the growth in our school programme the most recent figure show that we have more than community cadet which represent increase on the previous year of course none of this can happen without the selfless and invaluable contribution that adult volunteer make the good news be that they can indeed receive some remuneration for their effort depend on the activity that they be engage in historically cadet unit have have to put up with some fairly basic accommodation and my hon friend touch on that however we continue to make considerable effort to improve facility for cadet not least through the ongoing reserve estate optimisation programme school cadet unit have be transform the life of our young people for more than year once the preserve of independent school of unit be now in the state sector which be reversal of the previous situation in which of cadet unit be in independent school like the rest of our modern cadet force school cadet unit embody the ethos of the armed force and be laser focused on help young people to develop and reach their full potential in whatever walk of life they choose covid have slow our ambition somewhat but thank to our cadet force strategy the government have plan in place as well as the commitment to deliver their continue growth ensure that our cadet unit in school and community will continue to transform the life of more and more of our young people for many year to come question put and agree to house adjourn
