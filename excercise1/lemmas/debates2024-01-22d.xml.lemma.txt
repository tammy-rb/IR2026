white paper also commit we to increase the supply of social rent home and large number of the new home deliver through our affordable home programme will be for social rent local authority have be strip of resource for the past year and even conservative members agree with that do the secretary of state recognise that local authority and housing association need certainty and stability over time so that they have the confidence and security to invest in affordable social and council housing stock rather than the conservatives last minute unplanned change that wreak chaos and instability certainly agree that housing association do fantastic work in provide home for social rent as well as share ownership home and we work in partnership with they we be aware of the many pressure they be under the hon lady say that they need certainty and stability but that be why it would be so damaging if there be labour government with their billion black hole which would mean either more borrowing or tax increase and high interest rate for those aspire to get on the housing ladder that be why we should stick with the plan rather than go back to square one in my constituency of suffolk coastal flagship be sell house to second home owner that be scandal it try to suggest that it be because it can not repair they economically but it be not offer they first of all to the local council there be restriction and covenant that could be put in place if these be council house but they be not they be housing association home would love to meet my right hon friend to discuss this matter far to make

costly administrative third tier of local government we have provide additional funding to council in the east midland to set up the new local authority so any additional funding through network north will not be consume by that it be fantastic opportunity to get my hon friend the member for mansfield ben bradley elect as the east midlands mayor be sure that he will focus on exactly the priority my hon friend the member for amber valley nigel mills mention call the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee one of the well aspect of devolution so far which might actually work be the trailblazer project that have be roll out in the west midland and greater manchester one of the key element of those project be have single pot of money have repeatedly ask whether it be the intention to roll devolution deal out to the other combined authority and have be assure that it be why then in the first iteration of what new devolution deal might look like have south yorkshire merseyside and west yorkshire be tell that single pot of money will not be include in the devolution deal why be the government backtrack on the commitment to give those area full devolution deal not devolution minus deal we have invite the combine authority area that the hon gentleman mention to progress to level devolution which as he rightly say do not come with single settlement it be something that we be still consider and when we see it in action in the west midland and greater manchester we will be able to assess its value for money and whether it be deliver for people there assure he that this be not devolution minus we be give devolution plus to community the length and breadth of the country be big supporter of devolution to city region such as greater manchester and welcome number of the government proposal to shift even more power and responsibility from this place to the combine authority and mayor but do the minister understand the disappointment of greater manchester mps of all political persuasion in the proposal for great scrutiny by mp one question at meeting with supplementary at the discretion of the chair just do not cut it hold session for greater manchester mps on the scrutiny protocol can not remember whether the hon gentleman be there but be happy to hold further session with he the scrutiny protocol be not yet in place it be work in progress which we be try to establish in partnership with mps we want to know what would work well for mps in the scrutiny session call the shadow minister last week the secretary of state tell the business and trade committee that he hop that the long delay inquiry that he commission into teesworks and the tees valley mayor will be publish soon and that he would not pre empt it the report be promise in july then november then december it be now january where be it the hon lady should know that the ministerial code mean be recuse from matter relate to my constituency however would simply say to she when she want to criticise ben houchen that he be one of the most effective mayor we have have the employment rate in teesside since ben be elect have increase by compare with the rest of the north east which only increase by and the national average of she should focus her attention on some of the labour mayors like the labour mayor of london sadiq khan who be fail on housing fail on crime and fail on the thing that matter to people voter id election turnout what recent assessment he have make of the impact of voter identification requirement on election turnout we be pleased to see in the may election that the vast majority of voter in polling station be able to cast their vote successfully that amount to of those seek to vote fourteen thousand voter be turn away from polling station at the may local election for not have photo identification local council have be cut to the bone so they do not have the resource to ensure that everybody have photo id what will the government do to ensure that nobody be disenfranchised when we get to the general election there be nothing novel about have voter id france germany austria and canada all have it and we have have it in northern ireland part of the united kingdom for the past year understand that in internal labour party selection election their member also have to produce voter id we have full and comprehensive list of voter id which council have be use very well for those who wish to vote and do not have one of those form of id tiny number we also have the voter certificate available free of charge which allow they to vote we want to see as many people as possible voting and of course we want to see they vote conservative call the snp spokesperson the government voter id requirement which allow travel card for old people but not the young person equivalent be unfair at good but the reality be that this be political opportunism as have just be say analysis by the electoral commission follow england local election find that people be unable to vote due to voter id requirement there be real concern base on that datum that there will be potential impact in the forthcoming general election voter at local election be often small group of more politically informed people whereas the large group of voter who wish to cast their vote at general election may be less aware of the requirement do the minister agree with the word of his former cabinet colleague the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg that party that try and gerrymander end up find their clever scheme come back to bite they as we find by insist on voter id for election do not agree with that and nor will take any lesson on political opportunism from the snp be tempt to say that would whatsapp my answer to the hon lady but she would probably delete it before she read it lot will depend on whether the identification have the relevant hologram also point out to the hon lady she chunter from sedentary position without want to listen to the answer but of the who do not have the right identification come report january vol council budget deficit what assessment he have make of the cause of council budget deficit what assessment he have make of the cause of council budget deficit the department work closely with the local government sector and other departments to understand specific demand and cost pressure the provisional local government finance settlement for make available over billion an increase in core spending power of almost billion or in cash term we stand behind council up and down the country to deliver the service that their community look for it be recently reveal that devon county council be use its broadband clawback money to close its deficit that million be intend for improve broadband across rural area countryside connectivity be key to boost business so that they can pay their taxis so what do the minister plan for next year when devon county council finance minister put his hand down the back of the sofa only to find he have spend the million intend for broadband on pay day to day direct debit if the money from that department be ring fence it be not at the discretion of the county councillor where they use it they have to use it for that purpose would take the hon gentleman concern little more seriously if he have take part in the parliamentary engagement as colleague across the house do include the hon member for bath wera hobhouse or attend the westminster hall debate about mid devon council funding secure by my hon friend the member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger appreciate the time that the minister take to answer my question at the drop in session we will not cut nhs waiting time without good well resource social care my liberal democrat council colleague in bath be on track to bring social care back in house which mean well care that be well deliver locally and long term saving however even bath north east somerset council as he know and as have already point out be under severe financial strain will he therefore commit to extra funding to allow it to deliver the vital social care that my constituent so desperately need adult social care be demand on all upper tier authority commend banes council on the work it be do that be precisely the demonstration of flexibility and innovation in local government that we look for to deliver quality service in cost efficient way and it deserve our approbation for that with the department of health and social care we keep under review precisely those policy relate to adult social care to make sure that those who be most in need receive the service that they need in timely fashion would the minister like to put on record that he share my thank to councillor lezley picton the leader of shropshire council who have do fantastic job despite the challenge in try to get down the deficit there the council have find significant efficiency saving but there be still more to do ahead of the local government finance settlement announcement could the minister look at the rural service delivery grant and see what more can be do for large rural county such as shropshire which he will know be the large landlocked county in england be grateful to my hon friend and for the work that councillor picton do as the leader of his council he be absolutely right to point to the continue importance of innovation change and reform to ensure value for money that be key and to highlight the importance of the rural service delivery grant my right hon friend the secretary of state and remain committed to that and we hope to be able to make that announcement in due course rural council face disproportionate triple whammy from the rise cost of energy due to the ukraine war with rural council and rural public service have to pay high heating energy and labour cost could have meeting with my hon friend to talk about the fair funding formula to make sure that rural council be properly fund in this next settlement as rural member of parliament be tempt to tell my hon friend that he will be preach to the choir but of course be happy to meet he he point to the challenge that rural council face in deliver service in area that be wide in geography and sparse in population call the shadow minister the reality be that more and more council be be push to the financial brink it stand as fact that more council issue bankruptcy notice last year than in the previous year combine those council be conservative liberal democrat and no overall control but the one thing they have in common be the conservative government in downing street the local government association report that council face an immediate billion funding gap now that the deadline have pass can the minister confirm how many council have apply for exceptional financial support and whether pressure in adult social care child service and homelessness will be fully meet in the financial settlement it be not policy for we to comment individually on council that be seek advice from or engagement with official but be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question because it give the opportunity to put on record that my department and stand ready to engage with all those council who wish to discuss their financial circumstance we want to make sure that we have well fund professional local government sector deliver for those people in our community who look to they for the service that they require for their daily life public green spaces what step he be take to protect public green space through the levelling up park fund taxpayer be provide more than million to create new green space or significantly refurbish exist one the department own green flag award scheme which be currently operate under licence by keep britain tidy set the national standard for public green space and encourage local authority to ensure that park and green space be welcome safe and well maintain behind the closed door of the town hall labour control erewash borough council be plot to sell off large swathe of green open space include the former pewit golf course in ilkeston which have previously be designate as nature reserve will my hon friend take step to prevent local authority from sell public land without first carry out full public consultation and will he join on visit to the pewit site to discuss how we might save it from the hand of developer by law local authority be require to publish notice and advertise it before dispose of any open space this be exactly why it be so important that my hon friend be and continue to be the mp for erewash she can call out all the disaster of the labour erewash borough council which as fellow derbyshire mp see derbyshire labour do regularly all across my county it have the wrong priority and outcome and it make the wrong decision the minister might know that we have wonderful public green space in our country many of they be around london and in west yorkshire but be he aware that the decline of education department in many local authority owe to the policy of successive conservative governments mean that today the ability to organise school trip to green space be minimal could we have policy that allow all our child of whatever background to go to and enjoy those beautiful green space call the minister because if they can not get there to visit they they can not love they order mr sheerman please do not take advantage of the chair be try to bring the minister in and have to get many other in you be important but so be other people the hon gentleman should look at the conservative party record on education in over year in government there have be substantial improvement in education and teaching and our child be well readie for the challenge ahead as result local authorities four day week what assessment he have make of the potential merit of four day working week for local authority employee the government have be crystal clear that we do not support any attempt from local authority to implement part time work for full time pay remove capacity to deliver service to resident be not acceptable the government have take step to deter council from operate such practice and we will take further step if necessary the minister only early extoll the virtue of devolution in fact page of the tory manifesto say that the ambition be for full devolution across england build on the successful devolution of power to city region mayor and other how do that laudable aim fit with the government shocking attempt through threat and bully tactic to strangle the ability of local council such as south cambridgeshire district council to trial four day week and other money save initiative if the hon gentleman can construct an argument for hard work family across the country many of whom will be work two or three job to keep roof over their head that five day pay and benefit be commensurate with four day work week would be interested in hear it invite he in all seriousness to consider the impact on the public perception of the public sector if it be give out that we can afford to work four day week but still expect and receive five day pay first time buyer what step he be take to help first time buyer get on the property ladder be everything that be important about be conservative the government have range of scheme available to first time buyer include the first home scheme share ownership and right to buy so far nearly people have be help on to the property ladder by this government do the minister agree that while labour member actively block the building of new home for first time buyer the conservative government have increase the number to year high and help almost million household through government back scheme absolutely agree with my right hon friend hope he hear some of the chunter of come on from the opposition benches when he raise the absolutely correct point that when the opportunity be there for labour members they flub it they have block house that could be use for first time buyer people who need help and the most vulnerable it be all down to the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner thank the minister for that answer what discussion have he have with large uk bank such as danske bank in northern ireland to ensure mortgage be make as accessible as possible for first time buyer encourage they to buy not rent when they have steady income far be there any plan to reintroduce the help to buy isa be grateful to the hon gentleman for his important question get people on the housing ladder be absolutely vital that be why we introduce the mortgage guarantee scheme which extend the number of mortgage that be on the market for those people who need it include first time buyer be happy to talk separately to the hon gentleman about other idea that he may have leasehold what step he be take to reform the leasehold system right now the government be take action with the progression of the leasehold and freehold reform bill through this place which deliver on the government manifesto commitment on leasehold reform leaseholder in leazes park in newcastle be have their life ruin because their supposedly charitable freeholder the st mary magdalene and holy jesus trust refuse to allow they to extend or buy their leasehold across the constituency in cost of living crisis my constituent face exorbitant management fee high cost for fire safety and ever increase ground rent can the minister tell my constituent why when the labour party be commit to comprehensive and fundamental reform of the leasehold system as set out by the law commission he have bring forward leasehold reform bill that do not actually reform their leasehold the leasehold and freehold reform bill which be go through parliament at the moment go through in very constructive way so far with contribution from member of all party presumably because they recognise the value of the clause it contain will make substantive change for those who have leasehold at the current time we look forward to its continued progress through the house call the father of the house there will be agreement on both side of the house that reform be need for my part welcome the introduction of the leasehold and freehold reform bill to get people on to modern leasehold and commonhold and through the minister invite those who be suffer the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah explain that her constituent be suffer to put their point through mps to the department so that when amendment to the bill be table as many as possible can be discuss and accept be grateful to my hon friend as and the secretary of state have say we be keen to improve the bill where we can but it be substantial bill that will make substantial change for people who have need reform of leasehold for long time local government transparency what step he be take to promote transparency in local government step be always be take to improve transparency the local government accountability framework and transparency code set standard for transparency it mandate the publication of certain information such as spend the office for local government will promote transparency far by provide authoritative local government performance datum on the local authority datum explorer be cabinet member in local council should require the high level of transparency however fear that be not always the case when relevant previous criminal and custodial conviction remain hidden what advice would my hon friend give council leader about how to ensure cabinet member be fully transparent about their previous conviction where relevant to their role as cabinet member my hon friend raise an important question at the time of appointment all council leader should be aware of exist disqualification criterion bar councillor who have be give custodial sentence of three month or more or who be register sex offender if the council leader be not aware those people who be due to be appoint should make their group leader aware of those circumstance they have legal obligation to declare as election candidate this be an important issue the nolan principle be there for reason to maintain transparency and standard if my hon friend wish to write to with the detail of the case he have mention would be happy to receive his submission private rented sector what step he be take to reform the private rent sector the renters reform bill will soon enter its report stage in the house of commons that bill abolishe section eviction move the sector to system of periodic tenancy and introduce private rent sector property portal and ombudsman improve the system for responsible tenant and good faith landlord in my casework have see an alarming rise in the number of no fault eviction this be lead to family be move long way from my borough with child have to travel ten of mile to get to school every day the government have say that they be go to remove section eviction but they have not give the criterion under which they be go to do so and it seem that this be go to be in the hand of the minister opposition front benchers have offer to work with the government to eradicate section eviction the government say they would do it four year ago accord to the government own figure family have be threaten with no fault eviction when be the government go to co operate and get this resolve that be exactly why we be bring forward the renters reform bill however as we set out on second reading and in committee we will not be able to do that until the court system be able to cope with the increase number of case we hear evidence in committee about the huge increase in case that we will find we be introduce these reform in phase way so that court and the sector have time to adjust interruption would say to the hon gentleman and to the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner who be chuntere from sedentary position that it serve no one to leave tenant or landlord in limbo in court system that be not function properly chelmsford be brilliant city and lot of people want to go there to live but that do mean there be huge demand for property especially affordable property both to buy and to rent at the moment when we build new house the local authority can put quota of affordable home on those new build property but they can not do that when large office block be convert into flat will my hon friend arrange for to meet the housing minister so that can discuss how to make progress with my private member bill on affordable housing in conversion of commercial to residential property will ensure that the housing minister be able to meet my right hon friend housing developers information on associated infrastructure what assessment he have make of the reliability of information on associated infrastructure provide to buyer by housing developer it be absolutely vital that buyer have correct up to date and accurate material information on their purchase before they make decision to buy home be very grateful to my hon friend the minister he will know that promotional document put out by major house builder such as barratt homes taylor wimpey david wilson homes and so on to prospective purchaser on large scale housing estate commit absolutely to the building of health infrastructure which very often do not turn up just allocate piece of land simply be not good enough can he please make sure that we do not mislead purchaser and that frankly the doctor surgery be the first building to be build on many of these new estate my hon friend make hugely important point and be grateful for the time he have spend with in my first couple of month in the job to highlight this issue to articulate the problem and to show the real life example of where there be an issue he be such good champion of this issue for his constituency substantial amount of infrastructure have be build all across the country but where there be gap it be hugely frustrating and we will continue to work with assiduous member such as my hon friend to try to close they recent freedom of information request reveal that only third of the housing infrastructure fund have actually be spend which leave billion unspent the national audit office say that successful delivery of the housing infrastructure fund appear to be unachievable so what be go to happen to that billion the housing infrastructure fund continue to transform very difficult challenging and unviable area of the country it be be spend at pace and it will continue to be so we expect it to be able to transform more part of the country over the year ahead national planning policy framework neighbourhood planning what assessment he have make of the role of neighbourhood planning in the national planning policy framework the government recognise the time and commitment that community put into neighbourhood plan our recent update to the national planning policy framework mean that neighbourhood plan meet their identify housing requirement be now well protect from speculative development include through the additional reform come in the levelling up and regeneration act my lib dem run borough council still do not have an up to date local plan every day that pass mean that we be open to speculative housing development without the right infrastructure such as gp practice and road and those kind of thing my community be fantastic at produce neighbourhood plan but they be ride over roughshod in place such as desford where housing have be put in where the community do not want it will the minister look at increase the priority give to neighbourhood plan when community and local planning authority do not have an up to date local plan it be hugely frustrating when local plan be not in place as my hon friend indicate in his area the lib dem council have fail to do that which be let resident down there have be change as result of the national planning policy framework give additional protection through neighbourhood plan but district council and those with planning responsibility need to get their plan in place permit development urban homes if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of permit development right for urban homeowner to increase their property to four storey where that comply with the local authority design code we have introduce national permit development right to allow wide range of exist residential and commercial building to extend upwards by up to two additional storey we have also recently consult on proposal to apply local design code to those right and further announcement will be make in due course may urge the minister to go far and fast on this the permit development right would create beautiful urban townscape and unleash the big wave of housebuilde in half century which would in turn cut housing cost to rent or buy be green by allow people to live within bicycle or walk distance from work and protect rural landscape from urban sprawl and by increase the development potential of almost any urban building be the big single act of wealth creation in decade what to dislike there be absolutely nothing to dislike as my hon friend indicate about speed up the planning system to ensure we get the house we so badly need as know my hon friend will appreciate however there be always balance to be strike we must ensure that we take local people with we but we be commit to build more house and do so in the right place topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility early this month we launch the consultation on awaab law which insist upon time limit for repair in the social rent sector in the shaping of this law and many other initiative and intervention to help people in social housing the example of tony lloyd the late member for rochdale be in all our mind and heart awaab be one of his constituent and tony lloyd could not have be kind or more supportive of the effort of my department and other to see justice for awaab family the household support fund have support household in liverpool since its introduction the focus need to shift from crisis support to prevention but in the short term the demand for local welfare be rise like many other council liverpool city council say the household support fund will need to continue beyond march to keep resident well support to stay in and enter work and prevent an escalate crisis reduce pressure on public service include local authority what representation have the minister make to the treasury and the department for work and pensions to ensure the continuation of the fund after march the hon gentleman be absolutely right the fund have help many community in need particularly in liverpool he and other liverpool mps have be assiduous in make the case for its continuation and have pass that on to colleague leicester shire mps have plenty of time last week with two ministers from the department the levelling up minister and the local government minister to discuss the funding and structure of our county council to follow up will the minister for local government commit to meet the county council leadership to ensure that the funding and the formula that go with it be improve for the future thank my hon friend for his positive engagement alongside that of my right hon friend the member for charnwood edward argar and my hon friend the members for loughborough jane hunt and for south leicestershire alberto costa who come to see to discuss this issue last week would of course be delighted to meet the leadership of leicestershire county council with my hon friend the member for bosworth dr evans and his colleague through the good office of our hon friend the member for south leicestershire meet informally with councillor louise richardson the cabinet lead on health last week call the shadow spokesperson first mr speaker may echo the comment make by the secretary of state in relation to the late tony lloyd who will be greatly miss in all part of the house as we have hear from the shadow secretary of state the whole country have be level down since at an average rate of per person that be damn indictment of this government but with about project fund by the future high street fund the town deal and level up fund that decline should in theory not have happen how many of those project have now be complete and what evidence do the department have that those project have contribute to reduce regional inequality the evidence of the reduction in regional inequality be perhaps most marked in teesside and the tees valley where the conservative mayor ben houchen have be responsible for oversee an economic renaissance renew foreign direct investment and improvement in public health and education the message be clear if we want level up to work we need to elect conservative mayor in may the minister will be aware that labour run rotherham metropolitan borough council have recently give the go ahead for developer to build hundred of new home at highfield park in maltby on land that have always be greenfield what he might not be aware of be that the developer have give thousand of pound to the local labour party which none of the councillor vote on the issue declare what can he do to ensure that such greenfield site be not wantonly give over to developer be sorry to hear about the challenge that my hon friend have see in rother valley it be one reason that more conservative councillor need to be elect on to rotherham metropolitan borough council for the future we be absolutely aware that there be challenge we need to build more house and in the right place and the good way to do that be by get local plan in place and by the council that be responsible for that engage properly with their community about it my local authority be bend over backwards to try to build social housing and be commit to build new home yet the government be still stand in the way by place restriction on reinveste right to buy money in build social housing why will the government not assist local authority to build those house we have have few home year since do the minister accept that that be disgraceful record for the government we always stand ready to work with local authority of whatever stripe or colour to ensure the delivery of new home as the hon member know london be the region of the united kingdom that have perform worst against its housing target principally that be down to the mayor not to individual local authority so look forward to talk to he about what more we can do together there be powerful community campaign to stop an asphalt plant be build in countryside in my constituency the application have drag on for year will the minister look at how applicant and council can be compel to provide and process information in more timely manner so that such application do not blight the life of local people for so long my hon friend be absolutely right that we need decision at the early possible opportunity sometimes that be not possible but it be important that thing be do as quickly as possible that be one reason that we announce few week ago that we be monitor local authority planning application performance so that can see where they be and be not do the right thing lease holder at orchard house in my constituency be in an unsafe building with known defect they have be issue with remediation order but the freeholder be simply not co operate do this not suggest that the feudal freehold system should be abolish for flat as well as for house what assurance can the minister give my constituent that they will get help from somewhere it suggest to that the freeholder be do the wrong thing and where the freeholder be do the wrong thing they need to be hold to account through the court system as they be and they will eventually be force to do the right thing on the specific be happy to talk to the hon lady if that would be helpful we have million for bishop auckland through the levelling up fund the future high street fund and the town fund million for spennymoor through the long term plan for town and billion investment fund through the north east devolution deal it really be the conservatives who deliver for the north east be it not completely agree with my hon friend and thank she for her work in this role in the department and all that she have do to help level up in her constituency there be family wait on liverpool housing register we be face housing and homelessness crisis and the cost of provide temporary accommodation have go from to million in the past three year the leader of the council have write to the secretary of state twice when will the secretary of state wake up to this emergency appreciate the advocacy of liverpool mp on behalf of those in temporary accommodation and appreciate the scale and nature of the problem have be work with the mayor of liverpool city region and other to look at strategic future advisory panel report that we believe will unlock not just additional housing but additional investment in liverpool and the liverpool city region look forward to discuss that with the hon member and indeed the new leader of liverpool city council over the weekend the express run story about ferryhill in my sedgefield constituency be dumping ground for rapist and paedophile my constituent believe that have be drive by housing group advertising in the south to people that they have house in place such as ferryhill where no check be require can the minister meet to discuss how we can stop the degeneration of place such as ferryhill be very sorry to hear of my hon friend concern will meet he and discuss how our antisocial behaviour action plan can help in ferryhill refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests today more than of the government own mp have write to the prime minister with their concern about the financial situation face council and the need for emergency funding the local government association say that there be likely to be billion funding gap over the next two year if there be to be these council shortfall and many people will not see the essential service they rely on what will the secretary of state do to ensure that people still have access to the vital service they so desperately need think that of the mp who write that letter one be the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner and one be the hon member for somerton and frome sarah dyke so look forward to their join our rank as part of the swell tide of conservative support that see across the country on the specific of the hon member point we have be listen carefully to colleague in local government and will respond in due course local council tax payer in warrington quite rightly expect high level of governance and transparency when councillor be use public money to invest in commercial business which carry high level of risk do the minister agree that the decision by labour run warrington borough council to reduce the number of opposition councillor on its audit committee fly in the face of good governance and that question need to be ask about how it be manage its billion debt recognise the concern regard warrington debt of course the levelling up and regeneration act provide new power for the government to step in and take action to protect the public purse my experience be that where important scrutiny chairmanship role be hold by opposition party those who take the decision take well decision and the scrutiny be much well as result do the secretary of state think it be acceptable that leaseholder of lee court in my constituency should be without heating and hot water as well as experience multiple problem in the communal area if he do not think that be acceptable how and when will he strengthen the leasehold and freehold reform bill to stop these injustice from happen absolutely accept that and believe that write recently to lewisham council to draw attention to its responsibility in the area on metro mayors may draw my right hon friend attention to the decision of ben houchen to deliver the million darlington northern link road use network north fund do he agree that that be fantastic example of ben deliver for darlington and the tees valley it be just another example of ben houchen as metro mayor use all the power at his disposal and the resource release by this conservative government to ensure that at last teesside and the tees valley get the investment it need one reason he attract so much criticism from the labour party be that he be tory who deliver for teesside in way that no one have ever deliver before come on jim will the minister commit to far levelling up funding for the devolved institution for local sport club across northern ireland instead of fund casement park to the detriment of every other sport look for funding in northern ireland so that all tradition and all side of the community can benefit from the funding take the hon gentleman point seriously it be important that we support grassroots sport and other civil society organisation in northern ireland we be work hard to try to ensure that we can do that with our partner in restore executive in the meantime should say that be grateful to ulster rugby for end its relationship with kingspan which mean that we can unlock additional funding for grassroot rugby across northern ireland while be deeply disappointed that stoke on trent labour refuse to make the necessary term and condition change to help save stoke on trent city council funding there be united view across the political divide in stoke on trent that the legacy in child social care be cause huge financial strain on the local authority will the secretary of state do everything he can to work with councillor jane ashworth to ensure that that gap be fund and those child the most vulnerable in our society be protect absolutely hope that the house will note that my hon friend who fight incredibly hard for his principle and for stoke on trent be take typically statesmanlike approach in put his constituent first come the next general election people should remember that he be someone whose big heart reflect their good value road safety be put at risk by road that be not adopt because speed limit can not be enforce and often they do not get grit there be serious worry that people will get injure what more can the department do to ensure that key service road on big new housing estate get adopt more quickly my hon friend be absolutely right we need to ensure that developer live up to their responsibility to provide appropriate infrastructure it have be the case that number of fleecehold for want of well word development have unadopte road where child be at risk speaker statement before we proceed to the next business would like to make brief statement the link between member of parliament and our constituent be special and fundamental to the democratic life of the country as we enter the general election year many hon member be expect boundary change some will contemplate stand for constituency that they do not currently represent have receive number of representation from hon member from all part of the house about colleague involve themselves in their constituency think it would be helpful to remind the house of some important rule and convention regard constituency representation first member usually deal with individual case relate only to their own constituency when member be contact by someone seek assistance who be not she or his own constituent the normal expectation be that the person should be refer to the relevant constituency member secondly when member intend to visit another constituency other than in private capacity they should make every reasonable effort to inform the member represent that constituency before they do so that apply equally to ministerial visit the ministerial code state that the minister intend to make an official visit in the united kingdom must inform in advance and in good time the mp whose constituency be to be include in the visit should add that although the ministerial code do not apply to shadow ministers they should adhere to the same protocol if visit constituency thirdly when issue relate to another constituency be raise in the house the member concern should where possible and when time permit inform the other member involve in advance that apply equally to the tabling of write question hon member have duty to look after the constituent who elect they to this place boundary change do not take effect until the next election we must observe the convention of not involve ourselves with another member constituency until that time more generally understand that the political temperature will rise as we get close to an election urge all hon member to continue to treat each other with courtesy and respect in the remain month of this parliament the election seem to have start little too early funded childcare urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make statement on her department plan to roll out hour of fund childcare to year old in work family from april the government be roll out the single large expansion in childcare in english history by september we will provide work parent with hour of free childcare week from when their child be nine month old all the way until they start school by this government expect to spend in excess of billion every year on free hour in early education double the amount we be currently spend we be introduce that in phase from april eligible work parent will be able to access the first hour of free childcare each week for their two year old in september they will be able to access the first hour each week for nine month old year later in september they will be able to access the full hour for all eligible child age nine month upwards we want parent to be able to access the new offer as soon as they can deliver that ambition include increase childcare funding rate with an additional million in this financial year and an additional million in the come financial year we be provide grant to help new childminder enter the sector and to make it easy for the sector make change to the early year foundation stage that it have ask we to make we hear every day from family how significant this policy will be for their finance once the roll out be complete eligible family will save up to per year it will help parent to return to work or increase their hour and ten of thousand of parent have already successfully apply for their code ready to take up their place in april parent should visit to see the full range of support they be entitle to regard tax free childcare we will be issue letter with temporary code to any parent whose tax free childcare reconfirmation date fall on or after february and before april that will ensure that any eligible parent who need code to confirm their fund childcare place with their provider will have one and that no parent should worry that they will lose out welcome this opportunity to correct some misleading story about the childcare roll out and to hear from the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson about whether she support our childcare policy and if not what her childcare policy would be be sure member on the labour benches would like to know as much as we would in which case it would have be good to have come forward with statement rather than grant an urgent question so please bear that in mind before you make comment thank you mr speaker and thank you for grant the urgent question crumble school building botched school budget and now the hat trick childcare pledge in tatter because of conservative bungling it be not ministers but family across the country pay the price for tory incompetence how do we get here litany of failure pledge without plan and department without grip lead by ministers without clue family without the certainty of childcare place they be promise by the chancellor last march and meanwhile the department be face furth million shortfall because of yet another miscalculation how be they go to make up that shortfall family be face rolling wave of conservative chaos which wreck all before it for provider it be an utter fiasco where their income after april be still state secret when will provider be tell about their funding rate how many family do the minister estimate will now not be able to access new hour because of this shamble the prime minister official spokesman this morning say we be confident that the provision and capability be there we be confident in the strength of the marketplace but the market be tell they that their plan be simply not deliverable the chief executive of the early years alliance say that sign up to the new system be financial suicide for provider mr speaker this be not market it be an almighty mess and minister know it government source be brief the paper that there will be parent that just do get their place let explain to ministers in word of one syllable that be no good that will not work they must do more they need to fix it if provider can not price place now how on earth can they be expect to offer more in september can ministers guarantee to parent now that the roll out will be deliver on time yes or no it need not be this way sir david bell be lead labour early year review to ensure that childcare be about life chance for child as well as work choice for parent up and down this country family be feed up with this government their broken promise and their incompetence it be time for general election to end this tory shamble once and for all will try to pick out the question from the bluster on the million this be specific issue that affect september onwards where we allocate to local authority week of funding because that be the period from september to march some then say that they pay week to their provider so we have that money in order that they can provide week of funding where that be what they do on the funding rate we announce the funding rate for three and four year old in april last year and for two year old in report january vol give that local authority have to pass on of the money that we give they provider have pretty good idea of what they will receive however while the vast majority of authority will confirm their rate in the come week small number leave it until march we be encourage they not to do that and to confirm their rate as early as possible in the same way as the other the hon lady ask how many family would not be able to access the childcare offer as result of those two issue the answer be none as she know we have increase funding rate significantly neil leitch to whom she refer be in our stakeholder group and we value his input however think it will be clear to people watch these exchange that while we get on with the big delivery of childcare ever the labour party have no plan no policy and no idea how to help family with childcare cost the expansion of childcare be extremely welcome and have every confidence that the minister and the excellent team at the department for education will deliver this current expansion on time and that the funding will reach all the family who need it to be fair however the minister be deal with system that have become remarkably complicated over the last or year would he be interested in discuss with the chancellor the notion of roll up all the various funding stream that we provide for childcare and indeed for family support and instead of take money from people in taxis lose some of the administration and return it to they in the form of mandate childcare thus give every family with child generous tax break to allow they to make choice for themselves my right hon friend have write some article which have read propose that very idea we think that our present system be the good way of achieve what we want to achieve but be of course happy to continue my discussion with he good quality childcare be crucial economic infrastructure issue for parent now and the education of child in the future which be why we need it but the system be too complex and we can not access it in my constituency provider be collapse when will the government think about draw up workforce plan to try to stabilise the system before add more and more complexity for parent be not sure what the hon lady mean when she say that people in bristol can not access the system but if she send the detail shall be happy at look at they because have say ten of thousand of parent have already access it should also point out that while there have be fall in the number of provider there have be an increase in the number of both staff and place so we be confident that we will deliver the roll out as plan welcome the minister statement and work parent across my constituency welcome this expansion and the big ever investment in childcare in england today however receive letter from victoria morris very experienced childminder who have work in leigh on sea for more than year point out that someone who own nursery can claim the funding for child to whom they be relate include their own child but that do not apply to childminder she simply ask whether the minister would consider lift that ban so that childminder be on the same footing as other childcare provider the current legislation state that people can not access government money for look after their own child although it can happen in large setting we have no plan to change that at present but should be happy to have discussion with my hon friend we know of the challenge that many parent face in try to find an appropriate nursery for their child but it be even hard when child have special educational need accord to message have receive some nursery be refuse to take such child on can the minister say without equivocation that that be unlawful the hon gentleman have make an important point and he be entirely right we have hear from great organisation such as dingley promise that provider have not give place to child with special educational need and the team and be look into that to ensure that it be not the case parent ask for support with childcare and the treasury and the government have deliver it but the system do need to be simplify have be follow the analysis of the code and receive the code by pregnant then screwed which announce today that fix have be find and thank the department it would be helpful to hear little more about that will my hon friend meet for instance the new deal for parents group which be look for long term simplification will he also tell we how he be work through the different local authority area to show that there will be place available now and also in september because so many parent be look forward to that my hon friend have be campaign on this issue since she arrive in this place the tax free childcare code issue be specific issue cause by parent need to reconfirm their eligibility every three month to prove that they be still eligible if they do that quite late last year they be concerned that they might not be able to get the place they need in time for the march deadline as my hon friend say pregnant then screwed have fix that issue would be happy to meet the group that she mention on the sufficiency of place we be in monthly contact with local authority to ensure that they have sufficient place and only very small number be report any concern at this point report from the early education and childcare coalition last november find that only of nursery manager say they could offer the extended entitlement because of the crisis in recruitment in the sector and say they would limit the number of place they offer unless the government help with recruitment more than half of all nursery worker have say they be plan on leave the sector in the next month what will the minister do to address the crisis in recruitment and retention in the sector so that nursery can provide the extended entitlement that parent want we have see increase in the number of staff in compare with none the less part of the reason why this be phase implementation and expansion of childcare be to ensure that we have the number of staff we need and in couple of week we will be launch big recruitment campaign to get more people into the sector will the minister name and shame those authority that be be dilatory in publish their rate reserve the right to do that but we hope that if we ring they up first and ask they to publish with the threat of do that if they do not they will do so the current system of childcare support be not work it problem be cause parent to be lock out of the system code be not work there be no timescale to sort problem there be no response to complaint and people be wait week for money to be pay to provider if the current system be not work how do the minister expect to reassure parent that the new system which will rely on the same code and system be go to work simply do not accept what the hon lady if she want to send detail will be happy to take they up with any local authority that be not do what it be ask to do on the two particular issue with the roll out we have move quickly and provide solution for they this be the big ever expansion of childcare and it will be transformational for many work parent so it be bind to be really complicated to implement the minister have just say that only tiny number of local authority be report that they think they will not have sufficient place so do that mean that the vast majority of local authority say that they will have sufficient place what be he do to encourage more people to come into the profession and act as childminder my right hon friend be absolutely right the vast majority of local authority be already report that they will have the number of place that they need we be work with the small number that have challenge and we be confident that they will be in the right place by that point on her question about childminder one of the thing we be do be introduce brand new childminder grant scheme to encourage more childminder into the great early year career that be available hear the minister talk about the staffing for new parent or carer hand over their young child to the staff in the sector be one of the most scary thing those staff do fantastic work but be often pay low wage the women budget group have estimate that there will need to be at least additional new early year staff to cope with the increase in entitlement in term of recruitment and retention in the sector will the minister outline when we can expect the long term workforce plan for the early year sector so that we can actually have the staff it be no good have this increase in entitlement if there be no staff to look after the child the hon lady be right that we need more staff think she refer to the estimate in time for september rather than for the first part of the roll out in april which be part of the reason for the current recruitment campaign we be pleased to have already see increase in the number of staff welcome the fact that the government be roll out the big ever investment in childcare in england will my hon friend outline how much the average work family will benefit from the extend childcare entitlement my hon friend be right that it be the big expansion of childcare provision in history by the time the roll out be complete in september it will save the average family up to year in childcare cost many of we try to warn the government that this would be like help to buy push up demand without tackle supply number matter in this sector and it be day since the policy be announce and just day before it be due to be implement there have be separate question in this place about the staffing shortfall and none of they have be answer there be two child chase every register place and only two local authority have actually agree the rate it be little wonder that parent be frustrated will the minister set out here and now the staffing shortfall in term of deliver the two year old offer in april will he tell we what it be and will he tell we when he expect to close it as have already say the roll out be base on what be the number the hon lady cite the figure for september not for april be confident that in april she will see that we have the staff available for the roll out declare an interest as the father of two wonderful child charlotte and persephone who go to nursery in this very place and will benefit from the new proposal the uk have decline birth rate on average child per woman and we clearly need more child time and again when survey woman who want more child say that they be not have more child because they can not afford it thoroughly welcome the money that have be announce but what more be be do to support parent who say they want more child but can not afford to have they that could perhaps include look at the tax rate hope charlotte and persephone enjoy their nursery provision here which be sure be among the of early year provider that be good or outstanding my hon friend be right that childcare be one of the big financial challenge face family today which be why we be pleased to save they so much money be happy to continue the conversation about what else he think should be do to support family the shortfall in childcare provider be serious issue for constituent in putney eastwood nursery school the last remain state maintain nursery in my constituency be under immediate threat of closure it provide training for childcare provider across the constituency as well as excellent early year education do the minister support state maintain nursery will he meet to talk about the future of eastwood nursery school we certainly support state maintain nursery which play vital role in the sector would be delighted to meet the hon lady to discuss that particular case praise the minister for be on top of his brief and for iron out some of the misunderstanding fly around today be it not the case that as other have say the challenge of roll out this offer sit within the broad context of the ongoing workforce challenge today speak to provider that have setting and be not able to fully staff single one of they know the minister be do lot of work on this but will he say little more about how he plan to meet that workforce challenge with his recruitment drive thank my hon friend who have also do lot to champion the sector and to raise awareness of the challenge it face he be right that we need to get more people into the workforce particularly for the september roll out that be what the recruitment campaign and the change we make to the early year foundation stage be all about we listen to provider on the flexibility that might make their life easy and deliver almost everything they ask for in the hope that it will help they with recruitment and retention recently visit the ryton willows montessori nursery in my constituency where its manager explain her concern about the impact of the change on she and about how she be go to make the sum add up financially and provide an excellent service we have hear that the final figure be not available when will they be available will the minister undertake to review the figure to see that they meet the need of the sector we set our rate by conduct survey of provider in order to understand the cost they face and set the rate report january vol last november we delay publish the rate bit in order that we could provide more money to take account of the government near increase in the national living wage we believe we be get they right in relation to what people be pay but if the hon lady have particular evidence she would like to send will happily look at it last friday visit the butterfly lodge nursery in blackpool to hear the concern of early year provider many of whom be at break point they welcome the uplift in funding from april but they be keen to emphasise that it do not even cover the significant increase in their cost such as for utility and the national living wage what step be the government take to stabilise the sector and prevent early year provider from leave it altogether set out in my statement the additional money that we have give to the sector in the last financial year and this one to help it to meet those cost pressure that be anchor to the survey of provider that talk report january vol again if the hon gentleman want to send information datum or specific case study will gladly have look be glad the minister say that because have specific case from my constituency that wish to raise it relate to the parent of two year old and nine month old baby they be teacher in local secondary school and the mother be plan on return to work after maternity leave they have be really struggle with this issue of the portal when they would get the code through and so on hope that what be announce will help they but will the minister confirm that if it turn out that it do not will be able to write to he and get an immediate response yes and hope that the hon lady will do so we have take an extra cautious approach on this particular group of parent be affect and rather than just write to they we have write to much broad group of parent everybody whose reconfirmation window go from middle of february to the end of march so no parent should lose out as result of this issue and she should get in touch with immediately if those parent be encounter any problem the business involve in provide childcare need to be able to plan ahead the minister may say everything will be fine in april there may be some problem down the road but we be confident we can iron they out but that really be not go to be get people to invest in lease from premise and all sort of thing that those who run childcare business be go to need to commit to so will he give we bit more detail he say he be confident that this be go to meet the need but child be go to join the scheme accord to the government own figure where be those childcare provider go to get the information they need in order to be confident that they can invest to go forward we be in monthly contact with local authority and at least monthly contact with provider about this some local authority do take long time to publish their rate we be look at that because we have provide the information and the funding that we need to and we do not think it be right for provider in the sector to be wait right up until march to get that information so we be look at what we can do on that have say that some local authority have already confirm their rate and the vast majority will do so in the come week the initiative be suppose to provide additional childcare place yet of provider withdraw from the market last year include in the sandymoor part of my constituency how do ministers square that circle give the funding pressure go forward we be do all we can to help provider meet the funding pressure it be important for member of the house to understand that there be difference between the fall in the number of provider which can be see in nationally publish datum and the increase in the number of staff and place be confident that parent will be able to access these hour as entitle every time the government have make an announcement to improve childcare have welcome it be pleased to serve on the bill committee for the childcare act but question then exactly how the government be go to deliver the capacity need within the budget available the minister say that all would be well but he be wrong and it take year to build up capacity and the current offer be still not be universally deliver give the poor preparation for this late initiative how on earth can parent expect the government to deliver this time be glad that the hon gentleman have welcome our announcement on childcare although member on the opposition front bench have not do so we be in close contact with local authority and provider in order to deliver the initiative and parent will be able to get those first hour for their two year old in april do the minister believe that part of the consideration on affordable childcare will take into account the need for nursery to be able to operate alongside the cost of living crisis can additional funding be find to meet that need not for the sake of the delivery of promise but for the child who desperately need the care to enable their development and for the parent who simply can not afford to do it alone the hon gentleman raise an important point about the increase cost pressure that everybody have to face that be why we give an additional million in the last financial year and furth million in the current financial year to help meet those pressure base on the fact that we survey provider in order to understand exactly what they be pay for all the thing he report january vol measles urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care to make statement on the declaration of national incident in response to the recent surge in measle case thank the hon lady for give the chance to update the house on this important matter far to the write ministerial statement that we will publish later today the uk health security agency announce last week that it have declare national standard incident in response to an increase in confirm case of measle in order for our measle mump and rubella vaccine to work the world health organisation recommend at least coverage to maintain population coverage at the moment our mmr reach be for the first dose at month and for the second dose at five year this be not new issue there have be gradual decline in coverage over year because of number of factor range from the wakefield generation when dr andrew wakefield publish his discredit paper on the risk of mmr through to covid when routine vaccination be miss and there have be drop since then there have also be concern in particular community such as the jewish and muslim community about the type of vaccine use we have not be wait the nhs have carry out catch up effort over the past month proactively contact parent and carer of unvaccinated child age five and young and we have see increase in vaccination compare to the previous year however that be not enough nhs figure show that almost million child under the age of be unprotected and at risk of catch this serious and preventable report may vol correction measles be so infectious that one infected child in classroom can infect up to nine other unvaccinated child make it one of the most infectious disease worldwide while for most it will be mild illness one in five child with measle will need to be admit to hospital for treatment put additional pressure on the nhs want to stress that this be not just childhood disease for adult who have not be vaccinate it can be serious and potentially life change event my message to mum and dad with child who be currently unvaccinate be to come forward we have range of measure in place one million letter be go out to the parent of unvaccinated child across london and the midland we have extra clinic be set up by gps pop up clinic in school and vaccine bus target community with low vaccination rate we have hold two mp briefing session on and january one for the west midland and one for london today we have send out information to mps so that they can help we get the message out to their constituent to come forward it be not too late there be no age limit anybody who have not have their vaccination can come forward the first vaccine will provide roughly protection and the second will provide the message be to come forward and get vaccinate thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker the declaration of national incident due to the rise in measle case by the uk health security agency on friday be concern measle can be serious and it be extremely infectious with reproduction rate five time that of covid however it be also entirely preventable the minister be right to emphasise the importance of get vaccinate the mmr vaccine be safe effective and the good way to protect ourselves and our loved one against measle there be no age cut off for get an mmr vaccine there be alternative available for those who do not touch pork product once person have have it the vaccine can provide protection within two week urge anyone watch this who have not be vaccinate to contact their gp mr speaker we be in agreement that this issue be serious thank the minister for outline some of the step that she be take however we should never have get to this point the uk be deem by the world health organisation to have eradicate measle just five year ago since then mmr vaccination rate have plummet leave ten of thousand of child completely unprotected which mean that now one in five child be not protect with two dos by the age of five case have also rise consistently over the year and by in the past year alone so the warning sign could have be see from space what step be be take to get grip on this crisis before it become national outbreak how will the minister rectify her department failure to maintain child vaccination rate for contagious disease be this not another instance of government complacency when it come to protect our child health for the record mr speaker my team attend briefing with the minister and her official on this issue on january which she have mention request some more information and communication material that could use in my capacity as local mp give the rise in case in birmingham it take until this morning some day later to be send that information but only after national incident have be declare have the government be asleep have no lesson be learn from the pandemic that with highly transmissible disease the soon we act the well we see how much child suffer and lose out during the pandemic so the re emergence of serious childhood illness that we have vaccine for and that we know how to prevent be unacceptable when country across the world be measle free it be badge of shame that this government have lose the uk that status on their watch remind the hon lady that health be devolved matter across the united kingdom when she refer to the united kingdom low mmr vaccination rate do she include labour run wales wales have also not meet the who threshold and neither have scotland northern ireland or england it be real shame to play politic with this issue this be an issue of the utmost importance as have set out this government have be work over the past month to get vaccination rate up in england and we have see increase there be range of reason why we be see certain part of the country and some community not come forward the hon lady touch on the concern of the jewish and muslim community that wide range of mmr vaccine be porcine vaccine we do have non porcine vaccine available priorix be not just available on request follow meeting that we have with west midland mps we proactively push priorix out to community the help of local mp to get that message out to community would be extremely valuable there be also halal vaccine available again we need to get that message out so that people do not have to request it it would be routinely offer to they we be also undo much of the damage do to the wakefield cohort of young adult who be bear between and when dr andrew wakefield discredit paper on the risk of mmr lead to drop in the number come forward for the vaccine those young adult be eligible for vaccine right now to try to prevent the spread of measle we also know that covid disrupt the routine vaccination programme again that be key reason why all four nation of the united kingdom be not meet the who recommend coverage as have set out letter be go out to the parent of unvaccinated child because we recognise that rate have be low than we would wish one million have go out across london and the west midland of all part of the united kingdom it be the west midland that we be most concerned about to give the house some context last year there be more than laboratory confirm measle case in england over three quarter of which be from the west midland predominantly birmingham and coventry so there be particular push in the west midland that be why nearly two week ago we give briefing to local mps and local director of public health who be do an outstanding job at the coalface roll out pop up clinic in school and go out on community bus to reach community that may struggle to be reach through traditional route gps be put on extra clinic but we have to get the message out it be not through lack of vaccine or lack of messaging but we still have vaccine hesitancy we all have role to play in get community to come forward call the chair of the health and social care committee in april last year the uk health security agency tell the health and social care committee that it be expect measle to come back while the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation tell we that the threat be very real last summer as the minister know we publish vaccination report as part of our prevention inquiry we be pleased that in answer to recommendation nhs england publish its vaccination strategy just before christmas can the minister say more about how she will inject more urgency into the roll out and will she commit as we also ask to much more flexible delivery model for vaccination include through pharmacy the chair of the health and social care committee be right that be why we have meet with both the west midland and the london team to hear from those on the ground what resource they need in order to become more nimble in the vaccine roll out the community that be not come forward be the one that be not engage with the routine mmr vaccine programme so we need to be more nimble which be why we be hear from those vaccinate on the ground about vaccine bus go into community pop up clinic in school and gps put on extra vaccine clinic from our datum we have list of the child who be unvaccinate and more than million letter have go out to their parent to urge they to come forward my hon friend be right about use pharmacy with pharmacy first as model to make it even easy for people to come forward but the real barrier be people reluctance to get vaccinate for variety of reason whether it be vaccine fatigue through covid or because they miss their routine appointment and find it difficult to come forward at an extra clinic we be engage with local authority and the department for education to try to make it as easy as possible for child and adult to get vaccinate there be clear inequality in vaccination uptake include mmr which reflect various socioeconomic inequality what extra support be be give to those area and to place such as mine and why as the chair of the health and social care committee suggest be the risk assessment of the uk health security agency seemingly ignore by the government can assure the hon lady that it be not ignore by the government over the past month we have be push vaccination to those who have not come forward and to community that struggle with vaccination uptake which be why in the past month there have be increase as say that be not enough there be still people who need to come forward for vaccination who have not do so emphasise to the house that this be an acute outbreak of measle if someone have their first dose of the measle vaccine today within two week they will have roughly immunity if they go on to have the second vaccine they will have roughly immunity which will be lifelong might vaccination rate benefit from much more generous compensation scheme for the very small number of severe adverse reaction we have vaccine damage payment scheme which provide one off payment of that be accessible for any vaccine that someone take up but have to say that part of the problem be mislead information about the safety of vaccine the measle vaccine be safe at one point we have eliminate measle in this country most child will be fine with mild illness but we have have episode of child get encephalitis which be swelling of the brain that have lifelong consequence we must move away from the narrative that vaccine be not safe the measle vaccine be one of the safe vaccine people can have really do not think that that message be helpful during the covid pandemic my constituency of st albans have one of the high rate of vaccination that be in part because of the work of our gps and pharmacist but we be also incredibly proactive at recruit community champion who could have those vital conversation to tackle hesitancy within particular pocket of our community the minister have mention pop up clinic and van but she have not mention the role of community champion will she work with and support the director of public health to recruit those community champion who can have those vital conversation so that people can put their question to people they know and trust the hon lady be right that we use community champion during covid we have some particularly effective campaign for those community that do not traditionally come forward for vaccination and that be do by use community leader faith leader and trust organisation within community we be do that in the west midland in london and across the country those people tell we that one of the key thing that prevent jewish and muslim community in particular from come forward be their fear about the porcine vaccine just to reiterate we have two type of mmr vaccine priorix do not contain gelatine and be safe and effective as an mmr vaccine it be available on request but we be also push out its availability so that people do not have to request it and it be offer up front it be important that people know we have sufficient supply of the gelatine free mmr product and faith leader community group and organisation be try to get that message out to those two particular group my hon friend have an important message today because after clean water vaccine be the most impactful public health measure we have and without doubt they save life one of the lesson we learn through the pandemic be that the most effective way to reach hard to reach community be through faith and community leader and to take the vaccine to those community whether that be to mosque or temple will she do whatever she can to ensure that we employ the same measure this time and take the vaccine to the community and not expect the community to go to the vaccine will she also consider reach out to those fantastic vaccinator we have during the covid pandemic who be highly train to deliver vaccine to all age group and get they on board to get the mmr vaccination carry out as quickly as possible my hon friend be absolutely right pay tribute to the work she do during the covid pandemic to roll out the vaccine programme to those community group that have such an effective reach for something we be struggle with previously and she work hard on that that be exactly what we be try to replicate with this roll out and we be work with community group and faith leader but also take the vaccine out to community be on the call with the london team on friday and they have vaccine bus that they be take out to community centre and faith group so that people do not have to book an appointment to get the vaccine it be important to say that this be not just for child if an adult have not have their vaccine it be never too late to get the mmr vaccine to protect themselves against measle do the minister accept that the reduction in the number of health professional who support parent have contribute to the reduction in the number of parent present their child for the mmr vaccine and that that be one of the lesson we should learn from this situation would not agree with the hon gentleman we have plenty of vaccine that be one of the message we want to get out and that be both the traditional mmr vaccine and the non porcine vaccine we also have plenty of vaccination space we have space at gp clinic and pharmacy and the school roll out programme have space but we still do not have people come forward we really need the help of all hon member in this place to get the message out that people should come forward for their mmr vaccine to protect against measle every time my six year old come home coughing get bit scared because obviously measle be highly contagious it be important that we get the message out about the way it be pass on through cough sneeze and high fever the minister have outline range of area where the government be try to get that message out but the fact be that they be fight against system where number of the hesitancy message be share in closed group group that be get that message out to parent and carer who will not come forward will the minister outline what the government be do to counter that and to give people an informed choice on the vaccine so that they come forward with their child the hon lady be quite right that there be vaccine hesitancy and that be key reason why uptake have drop so significantly across all group but more in some group than in other that be why nhs england and the uk health security agency have write to more than million parent in the west midland and london to highlight the benefit of have the mmr vaccine as more case of measle break out we be see more people come forward to take up the vaccine because they be balance for themselves the risk of have the vaccine which be very minimal against the risk of have measle any help that hon member can give be welcome and we be very willing to hear any suggestion they have for helpful message in their own particular community the minister be right to point out that one reason for the decline in people come forward to take up the mmr vaccine be the rise of and misinformation about the vaccine not just online but sadly perpetrate in this house the online safety act do very little to tackle online and misinformation and to keep people safe what be the purpose of the government counter disinformation unit why be there no transparency on what that unit be supposedly do and when will the government stand up to the social medium platform and stop they proliferate this and misinformation and profit from something that be cause real world harm the hon lady have point that part of the vaccine hesitancy be due to misinformation about vaccine more generally that be why we be try to use the message of immunisation rather than vaccination because it be much more positive message we be also provide positive message and social medium graphic for community and member of this house to roll out to counter some of that misinformation it be really important that we get that message out there be problem with misinformation and want to reiterate that measle be highly infectious disease that can be eliminate by vaccination alone thank the minister very much for her positive response to this urgent question you and be of similar vintage mr speaker and recall get my measle vaccination at ballywalter primary school in the early so not yesterday but long time ago there be system where vaccination happen in school and think that be where it should happen the northern ireland audit office report that the number of pre school vaccination have be steadily decline and the rate of child get the mmr vaccine at two year of age have fall from in to in significant drop in northern ireland with population of million there be clearly crisis emerge not just in england but across the whole of the united kingdom in particular in northern ireland do the minister agree it would be helpful to have joint approach across the whole united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to ensure that child be vaccinate and more importantly protect against this awful disease it be always well to do it together that be my suggestion to the minister think that be the adjournment debate on measle laughter the hon gentleman be absolutely right and want to work with all four corner of the united kingdom because none of we be meet the world health organisation coverage for mmr northern ireland have similar rate to england at join up approach so that we have well coverage for mmr across the uk and can get back on top of breakout and eradicate measle once again would be very welcome point of order on point of order mr speaker at the end of last year raise the issue of other member of this house be active in my constituency without notify unfortunately that be continue and the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper and the hon member for sheffield central paul blomfield be out in rother valley on saturday it be worth note that other hon member be also in rother valley but they do notify since notify the two member that would be raise this point of order the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford have send her apology which have accept thank you mr speaker for clarify the situation on people go into other constituency early today hope that people visit other people seat be not turn into habit be glad that the hon gentleman acknowledge the statement that make which think be pretty comprehensive for members from all part of the house election fever have take over have not even notice that the election have be call but hope that member can calm down little and give due respect to each other constituency whatever party they belong to please treat other as you wish to be treat offshore petroleum licensing bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time britain be the first major economy to halve its emission that be an incredible achievement how have we do it we have increase our renewable electricity capacity fivefold since nearly half our electricity come from renewable now up from in and just two week ago set out the large nuclear expansion for year we continue to have some of the most ambitious climate change target of any major world economy here in the uk we be commit to reduce emission by at least by from level where be everybody else the eu be commit to have recently reject move to and the united states be at just it be clear that when it come to climate change we can be proud of our record and the work that we will do we have manage to achieve that while act to help family with their energy bill we step in to help family struggle with energy price after putin invasion of ukraine and our total support for the cost of living stand at billion package that be among the most generous in europe last year we pass the landmark energy act which lay the foundation for clean and more secure energy system our change to competition to manage energy consumption and to incentivise investment in new technology will mean billion in saving for consumer as we work towards net zero we have oversee huge increase in the number of energy efficient home from in to almost half today and we be invest more over the next parliament to continue that important work the secretary of state paint very rosy picture particularly on renewable so why have her own energy tsar resign in protest we do not actually have an energy tsar but we have an energy secretary of state respect the former member for kingswood and wish he well in his next job but if we care about reduce emission the question that everybody in this chamber need to answer be why would you import fuel with high emission from abroad we be invest in more renewable energy we be start nuclear revival and we will support new technology such as hydrogen carbon capture and fusion this be our plan to have balanced energy policy however we need to ensure that the transition work for the british public and the british economy our plan can not be base on ideology they must be base on common sense even the climate change committee own datum show that when we reach net zero in we will still be use oil and gas for significant portion of our energy that be because it be not absolute zero it be net zero in other word while our use of oil and gas will diminish rapidly we will still need both for decade to come our bill will improve our energy security and that of europe in the past two year europe have have to wean itself off russian oil and gas we have respond by triple gas export to the continent and we be net exporter of electricity to europe in for the first time in more than decade we do not live in world in which we can simply turn off oil and gas be the right hon lady say that the only licence the government intend to issue be for gas and oil destine for the british market be glad that the hon gentleman ask that question because the labour party have be spout an awful lot of nonsense when it come to this area in the uk we be bless with the geological gift that be the north sea it be an incredible national asset virtually all the gas produce there go straight into the uk gas transmission network and it be equivalent to about of our overall gas need when it come to oil of what be refine abroad be refine in europe we be net importer overall the question that the hon gentleman should answer be this if europe do not get that oil from the uk where would he like europe to get it from from russia or from far afield that question be at the heart of the bill we know that we be go to need oil and gas where do we want it to come from only an ideologue would argue that we be well off import dirty fuel from abroad than use what we can produce at home however it be not just energy security that dictate that we should use our own resource the economic case also show that introduce annual licensing be the right thing to do do the right hon lady accept that despite the way in which some member of this house have try to rubbish that idea and argue that have our own oil and gas do not mean any energy security for the uk of the gas that we extract at present stay in the uk would they prefer to import that thank the right hon gentleman for make that point not only be it well for energy security but gas that we bring in from abroad in the form of liquefy natural gas have emission four time high so if member care about the environment they should back this bill domestic oil and gas production add about billion to the uk economy annually and bring in ten of billion of pound in tax revenue to give an example of how that have help support family with the cost of living we raise billion in tax revenue last year from the oil and gas sector that be money that we can use to support family as we do last winter pay half the average family energy bill which amount to roughly per household if we have no oil and gas sector billion more would have fall on taxpayer shoulder why should we concede that tax revenue to other country what possible benefit could the british public feel from billion of pound in tax revenue that could be raise here be send abroad all to import fuel with high emission now turn to perhaps the most important reason to back this bill the worker there be people support by the sector in community such as those in aberdeen grimsby and the north east of england and include people in scotland over people in yorkshire and the humber and people in the north west the right hon lady know as well as do that most of the gas we import come from norway where gas production be half as pollute as it be in the uk so let we not have all this nonsense about import be so much high in carbon intensity because those from norway certainly be not do she accept the fact that most of the emission be produce when we consume the oil and gas and therefore will she start look at scope emission and not just the production emission which be not the great emission in question thank the hon lady for her question but think it fundamentally misunderstand the energy market when we can not get norwegian gas and when we have make the most of all of our gas what be the marginal gas that we use it be lng which produce emission four time high than the gas we can produce here if we produce less uk gas we will need more lng come back to what be really critical part of the bill the worker recent report from robert gordon university find that fast decline in our oil and gas sector which the opposition be propose could halve the workforce by lead to significant loss of skill for the future energy sector those be the worker whose skill we will need for our future energy production the same report find that over of the uk oil and gas workforce have skill that be transferable to the offshore renewable sector however if we do not manage that transition correctly everybody in the chamber today agree that we need to transition we will lose those very important worker and their skill it be the same people who be work on oil and gas rig today who we will need on the offshore wind farm of tomorrow our subsea installation engineer who lay cable our technician who remotely operate subsea vehicle our diver our project manager and our engineering specialist service our offshore rig those be all essential oil and gas job that we know will be critical in the roll out of our low carbon technology if we do not protect our world lead specialist we will see community decimate and ultimately skill exodus that would put at risk the very transition that we be work so hard to achieve my right hon friend be make very powerful point about both energy security and get those job those british job recently visit the falkland islands with cross party delegation and when we meet the falkland islands government they say that they be desperate to unlock the sea lion oilfield and to get british worker to operate that field obviously the falkland islands be british overseas territory yet they be be stymie by the uk treasury which will not underwrite it do my right hon friend agree that the next thing we should do be back overseas territory by develop their oilfield so that we can have good british overseas territory oil and gas in the uk and british job in the overseas territory and support our one big happy commonwealth and overseas territory family my hon friend make an interesting point and would be very happy to meet he to discuss it far let turn to investment in the sector think we agree across all party in the house that we want to be world leader in clean energy technology here in britain we have many competitive advantage and we want to exploit all of they to have bright energy and economic future right now the oil and gas sector be invest in hydrogen carbon capture and offshore wind well manage transition help ensure that as we get more investment and grow these sector people can transition alongside in an orderly and organic way to shut down the oil and gas sector too soon would not only risk that investment make it hard to do the transition and see those sector grow more slowly but risk people livelihood the offshore petroleum licensing bill will give the industry the certainty it need to invest in this important sector if we need oil and gas in the decade to come it should come from britain where it can use the resource on our doorstep to benefit britain be simple common sense this new legislation will require the north sea transition authority to run an annual process for new exploration and production licence on the uk continental shelf subject to key test be meet first that the uk be project to remain net importer of both oil and gas and secondly that carbon emission associate with uk gas be low than for import liquefy natural gas these test be in place to provide assurance that proceed with annual licensing remain the right thing to do this bill will provide the industry with certainty on the future of licensing round increase investor and industry confidence it will increase our energy security protect job secure ten of billion in tax revenue and help we reach net zero member should not just take my word for it voice across industry recognise the need for new licence for net zero and for our energy security in fact stuart payne the chief executive of the north sea transition authority recently write that produce as much of the oil and gas we need as possible domestically be the right thing to do for security and the economy offshore energies uk have say the uk need the churn of new licence to manage production decline national gas have say that by back gas today we can create job secure energy independence deliver net zero and keep cost down for household and business the general secretary of the gmb have say that not proceed with new licensing risk leave the uk even more dependent on energy import to heat home and power industry in future that bad for our national security and prosperity have no doubt that the opposition will whip their mps against the bill they want to shut down new oil and gas licence and they have be very clear about that suspect there be many in the labour party who understand what turn off the tap would mean for british worker and they will vote against this bill with heavy heart they know that the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband have get this wrong be it not just common sense that if we need oil and gas it should come from uk water rather than from foreign and often unreliable regime abroad be it not well to produce our own gas instead of ship in liquefy natural gas that have four time the production emission of our own be it not right that the billion of pound in tax that we raise from this sector stay here rather than be send abroad be it not the position of an ideologue to say we will not support british worker but we be happy for those job to go to russia or far abroad the position of the labour party and the snp be not right for the environment not right for the economy and not right for the energy security of this country as the head of the gmb warn this weekend it would be export job for the sake of import virtue it would mean thousand of job lose community decimate tax revenue forgone and all so that the right hon gentleman can appease his friend in just stop oil they be put the interest of extreme climate ideologue over those of ordinary worker what of labour wide energy policy the truth be that when it come to this critical policy area its policy be as clear as mud we know that it hinge on borrow billion which would mean thousand of pound in extra taxis for every family while we be cut taxis the opposition would see they soar which be not what the people of this country need the right hon gentleman should level with the british public what taxis would he raise to pay for this extra billion of borrowing when he be shadow business secretary he say that billion be the scale of investment require the opposition have say that they need to spend billion to meet their decarbonisation ambition so why will the right hon gentleman not set out which taxis he would raise how be he go to squeeze more money out of hard work family to achieve his pipedream if he really think billion in extra spending be essential he should have the courage to explain how much bad off taxpayer will be while the labour party struggle to back its own plan over the past few month we have secure billion worth of private investment in clean energy that be the difference between they and we we know private investment be key to transition but they would rather taxpayer shoulder the cost alone through more borrowing and high taxis that be the choice the house must make today do we support the oil and gas sector and the private investment that come with it or do we leave taxpayer to foot the bill we can not afford to lose the skill the revenue or the investment the sector provide to do so would put net zero in jeopardy we must deliver this transition in proportionate pragmatic and realistic way ensure that we make the most of the energy we produce right here in the uk that be common sense and that be what the legislation represent with this bill we will protect job strengthen our energy security secure ten of billion of pound in tax revenue ease the transition to renewable energy and supply ourselves with gas that have only quarter of the production emission of lng import or we could follow the approach of the opposition and decimate community that rely on the oil and gas sector rack up borrowing by billion year send taxis soar to pay for it and send british job and tax revenue abroad all to import fuel with high emission the choice be very clear we be on the side of common sense not ideology and commend this bill to the house beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and add this house while affirm the need for urgent action to tackle the uk energy insecurity the cost of living crisis and the climate crisis and for manage fair and prosperous transition for worker and community decline to give second reading to the offshore petroleum licensing bill because mandate annual oil and gas licensing round will not reduce energy cost for household and business as the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have state will not enhance energy security offer no plan for the future of the uk offshore energy community will ensure the uk remain at the mercy of petrostate and dictator who control fossil fuel market be entirely incompatible with the uk international climate change commitment and be totally unnecessary piece of legislation which will do nothing to serve the uk national interest want first to express my deep condolence to the family of the two people kill by storm isha and my sympathy to all those face power cut and disruption from the storm the propose legislation we be consider today will not cut bill or give we energy security drive coach and horse through our climate commitment and learn nothing from the bad cost of living crisis in memory which the british people be still go through cost of living crisis cause by our dependence on fossil fuel since the launch of the bill two month ago the case for it have disintegrate on contact with reality let remind the house of the series of unfortunate event that have befall the bill since its publication on day one launch day the energy secretary go on tv with the big reveal tell the public the bill would not cut bill next we discover from confidential minute of the north sea transition authority that it think the bill be unnecessary and compromise its independence interruption the minister for energy security and net zero the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart say from sedentary position that that be not the case he be wrong and will read he the minute the board express unanimous view that such proposal be not necessary for the nsta the board note that the proposal would significantly challenge one of the tenet of independence for the nsta as the right hon gentleman be enjoyably quote the nsta minute not its on the record comment will he also support its position that we should maximise all of the oil and gas production in the north sea that be not the nsta position as have discuss with it next lord browne the former ceo of bp attack the bill and say it be not go to not make any difference to energy security then britain most respected climate expert lord stern pillory it as deeply damaging mistake then on the eve of cop the conference of the party the former prime minister the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may who sign net zero into law say she disagree with the bill to my knowledge she do not support just stop oil you do of course do then the former cop let be serious then the former cop president the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma man respect around the world who we be lucky to have play that role at say the bill be smoke and mirror not be serious the opposite of what we agree to do internationally finally their own net zero tsar the man they trust to guide they on question of energy be so disgusted by the bill that he be not in the chamber today in fact he be so ashamed that he have flee to the chiltern hundreds that be certainly get long way away from the right hon lady the secretary of state and her policy it show how far people will go it be not so much the oil and gas extraction bill but the conservative mp extraction bill that she be put forward today the former net zero tsar say can no long condone nor continue to support government that be commit to course of action that know be wrong and will cause future harm we should take all these voice lord browne the former prime minister the former net zero tsar and the former cop will come to all the argument that the secretary of state make if she will give minute as develop my argument the big point be that we face massive challenge as country but it be not the scale of our problem that be so apparent today but the smallness of the government response we have risible two clause bill that she know will not make any difference to our energy security because everyone who know anything about this subject say so as the bill have fall apart the government have thrash around to try to find rational justification and they have make one futile argument after another let we take each in turn the first argument be that the bill will cut price in case the house be think do they really make that claim the claim be make by the prime minister in tweet at am on launch day he say that the bill will help reduce energy bill as we less expose indicate assent the secretary of state nod but put on record my thank to she because she have be an internal one woman rebuttal unit against the prime minister she go on breakfast tv before the tweet so we might call it prebuttal and say that the bill would necessarily bring energy bill down that not what we say she be right because oil and gas be trade on international market if the right hon gentleman have read the full quote say that indirectly through support to the renewable sector the bill bring down bill the fact that we can raise tax to help people with the cost of living also bring down bill if he would like to bring down bill for people in this country he should back this bill that be great because the secretary of state anticipate my rebuttal of the second bad argument for this bill which be the argument she have just go on to make she say that the tax revenue we get from fossil fuel justify this policy and we have hear it again today if anything that be an even more complete load of nonsense than the prime minister argument because these be the fact it be our reliance on fossil fuel that have cause rocket energy bill that mean that the government be force to step in to provide support for household and business interruption minister should just listen the cost to government of the support with bill have far outweigh any tax revenue accord to the office for budget responsibility the windfall tax receipt from oil and gas company raise billion and the cost of government support be more than billion or the government say billion the idea that our dependence on fossil fuel can be justify by the tax revenue we get when they have spend billion try to help people be obviously nonsense there be third bad argument and again we hear it today which be that somehow this bill strengthen our energy security again it be important to have few fact in this debate here be the fact the uk north sea gas production be set to fall with new licence by by or without new licence by that be the equivalent of four day of our current gas demand all this absolute codswallop about the bill guarantee our energy security and somehow guarantee job be risible nonsense here be the thing we have have real revelation in this debate the government have admit the truth which be that the vast majority of oil be not use in this country it be export elsewhere and of our remain reserve be oil not gas the idea that this make any difference to our energy security be nonsense these be private company sell on the private market and the government have absolutely no response the fourth bad argument be that the bill will somehow protect job that be wrong we owe it to oil and gas community to protect they in the transition but give the conservatives record in constituency such as mine we will not take lecture from they on just transition we should admit truth the fossil fuel market be not just deeply unstable for consumer as we have see over the last two year but deeply unstable for worker it be total illusion that new licence will somehow guarantee job for north sea worker in the last year the number of people work in oil and gas have more than halve the international energy agency predict peak in fossil fuel demand by that be why its head say new large scale fossil fuel project not only carry major climate risk but also business and financial risk for the company and their investor that apply to worker too the right way to have manage transition in the north sea be to carry on use exist field labour government will do that and to have plan for north sea worker by drive forward with job in the industry of the future offshore wind carbon capture and hydrogen but that be not what the government have do we have graphic example of that last week the world large float wind prototype sit off peterhead that be good thing but it need maintenance so where do the maintenance happen not in scotland and not anywhere in the uk it have be tow back to norway that be the scale of their industrial policy failure we know it very well the government have not generate the job that british worker deserve and their fossil fuel policy and net zero roll back have send terrible message to investor around the world this be what amanda blanc the chief executive officer of aviva and the head of its uk transition plan taskforce say about oil and gas and the government position this put at clear risk the job growth and the additional investment the uk require to become more climate ready it be britain lose the global race in clean energy job that will destroy the future of oil and gas community the government have no proper plan for those worker labour do have proper plan do my right hon friend agree that the bill be an absolute disaster for climate diplomacy turn diligent negotiator into hypocrite and trash our international negotiation and international reputation be it not clear that without proper diplomacy future generation will be leave with much more dangerous and less stable world my hon friend be absolutely right she take to the fifth and final bad argument that the government be make for the bill will the right hon member give way in moment the government argue that the bill can somehow be justify on climate ground which demand level of absurdity that should make even they deeply embarrassed let we get this straight we sign global agreement at for transition away from fossil fuel in line with the science that science be unequivocal we must leave the majority of fossil fuel in the ground but at home their domestic policy be what they call maxe out the north sea let we get this clear in the crucial come two year ministers will travel around the world to try to turn that agreement into reality but how will the conversation go the uk minister will say to other country we want you to leave your fossil fuel in the ground because that be the agreement from the country we be try to persuade will say to we hang on minute you say we should leave our fossil fuel in the ground but you plan to extract all your what will we say other than yes the government be practise total hypocrisy but please do as we say not as we do that be the truth the science be unequivocal be hop to intervene when the right hon gentleman be talk about job and investment because he quote an awful lot of people why do he not quote sir ian wood who say that labour plan for the north sea oil and gas industry would place in jeopardy ten of thousand of job david whitehouse the chief executive of offshore energy uk say that labour plan would create cliff edge deter investment and heighten our risk of energy shortage why do he not mention those people be very happy to talk about ian wood we have good roundtable with he in aberdeen in november totally accept that it be for government of either party to show that there be proper transition plan firmly believe that we can do it but honestly the hon gentleman know that it be not the case that new licence will somehow guarantee future for those north sea worker how could he possibly say that four day worth of gas demand in will guarantee future for those worker the right hon gentleman will know that of our current oil consumption be use in the manufacturing industry not to be burn but for thing such as lubricant solvent and electronic component that do not contribute to greenhouse gas emission be it acceptable to extract it from uk water eighty per cent of what we get from uk water be export not use here we say clearly that we would continue with exist oil and gas field there must be transition and we can not carry on regardless and max out the north sea know the right hon gentleman care about the climate it be important to listen to the respected authority on climate there must be reason why the international energy agency the energy transitions commission the climate change committee the former president of the right hon member for reading west and lord stern all say that the world be genuinely on burn platform and unless we address the issue of fossil fuel we will head not to but to of warm that be the truth it be incredibly hard but the idea that we will say look there be climate crisis this will not make any difference to our energy security the energy secretary say that it will not cut bill it be not the answer for the job of the future but we will carry on do it anyway be climate vandalism genuinely say that to the right hon gentleman he shadow year ago and know that he care about these issue along with the right hon member for reading west people who really care about these issue have wrestle with this question we have listen to the expert and we have think to ourselves what do the science tell we on the one hand and what difference will this make on the other fair minded people have reach the conclusion that have reach as have lord stern and all the other authority previously raise the progress report from the climate change committee which say that the government be off track the secretary of state then assure the house that the government remain extremely ambitious about climate change do my right hon friend agree that she must have mean that she support cause climate change give she be press ahead with new oil and gas licence do not believe that it fulfil the kind of climate leadership that we pride ourselves on in this country here be another interesting fact for the house uk export finance think with the guidance of the right hon member for reading west decide at that we would not finance oil and gas project abroad now there must be reason why ukef decide that presumably the reason be that we want to make the transition away from fossil fuel at the same time as ukef decide not to do that we will look like hypocrite if we do this by say we just go to carry on maxe out at home know there be lot of other people who want to speak mr deputy speaker we have bill rise oh go on that be very tempting so will give way to the hon gentleman be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way he have speak for an awfully long time and suspect he be come to the end of his speech so that back benchers can participate not one idea have he put on the floor of the house about what labour would do be it to take over from we will tell the hon gentleman exactly what we would do be really grateful to he for intervene but be sorry he have lengthen my speech we would establish national wealth fund to invest in british job to give future in steel and automotive and to invest in our port we would set up gb energy to generate wealth for our citizen if it be good enough for country abroad why be it not good enough for we we would insulate home across the country we would finally lift the disgraceful onshore wind ban that be add to every family bill that be just the start do not want to detain the house for too long but there be plenty more where that come from will the right hon gentleman give way will not give way the truth be that there be two road for britain future drive to clean energy by to cut bill and make we energy independent and gb energy to bring job in clean energy here at home and be climate leader or government who take the wrong path cle to expensive and insecure fossil fuel and make the british people pay the price as they have for the past year the truth be that the bill speak volume about government out of idea and embark on that second path the bill be one of the last desperate act of die government urge the house to support our reason amendment and vote against the bill tonight refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests agree with the secretary of state who hold in high regard that the united kingdom have be leader in climate action internationally we have cut our emission in half over the past year fast than any other major economy in recent year we have set ambitious domestic emission reduction target in particular ahead of through our presidency we manage to get over of the global economy sign up to net zero just about every nation sign up to net zero commitment we lead on climate action domestically and we translate that into lead the world on climate action just few week ago at the uk alongside other nation sign up to transition away from fossil fuel on his return from the minister for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart welcome that global agreement from the dispatch box he speak about the importance of listen to the voice of the most climate vulnerable island nation who as we know want the world to agree to strong language to phase out fossil fuel indeed my right hon friend himself tweet at there must be phase out of unabated fossil fuel to meet our climate goal commend the work that he and the whole uk team do in dubai but today we have bill before the house the sole purpose of which be to double down on grant more oil and gas production licence do not believe and it pain to say this that the bill will advance that commitment to transition away from fossil fuel also do not believe that those climate vulnerable nation my right hon friend refer to will think the bill be consistent with the pledge that we along with every other nation make in dubai as for the substance of the bill think that as currently draft and it pain to say this it be something of distraction do not think it be necessary the north sea transition authority can already grant licence annually or indeed when it consider it necessary it have be do that regularly for the past few year the department own explanatory note make that clear by state the nsta will remain free to grant licence outside this new annual duty in the usual way whether or not the new statutory test be meet as for those two statutory test they seem to override the already non bind climate compatibility checkpoint and have to say that think they have be design in such way that the computer will always say yes to new oil and gas licence overall the ability of the nsta to grant new licence will not change materially as result of the bill sadly however this be my opinion and other will have theirs what the bill do do be reinforce the unfortunate perception of the uk row back from climate action as indeed we see last autumn with the chopping and change of some policy and that do make our international partner question the seriousness with which we take our international commitment say it pain to say this because know that the government have be come forward under this secretary of state with commitment to try to tackle climate change and deliver on clean energy transition we have hear that the bill be about improve domestic energy security but think we all understand that the oil and gas extract from the north sea be own by private enterprise and the government do not get to control to whom it be sell moreover think it be acknowledge that the bill would not necessarily low domestic energy bill in the uk give that the price of oil and gas as commodity be set internationally think that the good way to enhance our energy security and ultimately bring down bill be for the government to continue to deliver on their ambitious plan for expand home grow clean energy to which know the secretary of state and her ministers be absolutely committed that mean more wind power more solar and more nuclear as part of diversified clean energy mix and back the secretary of state in the work that she and her team be do in deliver that clean energy mix we have hear that the bill will secure job of course people job and livelihood matter and we must ensure that we secure those job but we must recognise that we be in the process of an energy transition support an orderly transition for this be not about turn off the tap overnight on oil and gas we must also acknowledge that more than job support by the oil and gas industry have be lose over the past decade despite hundred of new drilling licence be issue we know that many of the skill use in the oil and gas sector be transferable to clean energy to offshore wind and geothermal if we want to truly turbocharge clean energy transition we need to help support and retrain the worker who be make the transition over time from the fossil fuel sector into the many ten of thousand of job that be be create in clean energy as result of the work that the secretary of state and her team be do the right hon gentleman be make some powerful point and have huge respect for he when it come to this topic do he agree that we be in real danger of turn off the interest and the investment appetite among many other nation such as korea and japan which see the uk as have vast expertise in offshore wind development site and that legislation of this kind will undermine that market there be some commentary express concern about investment appetite follow some of the statement that be make in the autumn but think we must acknowledge that over the last few month the government have manage to secure billion of pound of extra investment commit within clean energy to the uk turn to the carbon intensity test for grant new licence have to say again that be not sure that the government recognise the whole picture of where we get our import from the majority of the gas that the uk import come via pipeline from norway it be not import lng the carbon intensity of norwegian gas production be around half that of uk domestic gas if that be the test that the government want to apply in decide whether to issue new licence think they should take into account the average carbon intensity of all import gas not just lng give that around of remain north sea reserve be oil perhaps the test should also include the carbon intensity of uk produce oil which be high than the global average put that very point to the secretary of state in our select committee and her response be that because almost all our oil be export out of the uk for processing we do not know what its full carbon intensity be be that not great example of why our oil be not use in britain and why this will not help british people the secretary of state have set out her position very clearly and eloquently be try to set out my position on the bill the government say that the independent climate change committee own datum show that we be go to need new oil and gas in the decade ahead but respectfully say that that be not the same as say that new licence should be grant the weekend before this bill be originally due to have its second reading the interim chair of the committee put out tweet to reconfirm the ccc position he write that evidence be that continue expansion of new oil and gas reserve be inconsistent with our climate commitment especially more so in light of the recent global stocktake cop agreement we just sign for the reason that have outline will not vote for this bill today but assume that it proceed beyond its second reading hope that it will be possible to work with minded colleague and indeed the government the secretary of state and her ministers to amend and improve the test that be require to be meet before any new oil and gas production licence be grant in the future in conclusion deliver on the uk clean energy transition matter on many level for job for inward investment for low bill for real energy security and of course for the environment we see the impact of the change climate around we daily be the hot year on record globally and in recent week many people have face flooding again in our country include in my own constituency we really should not need any more wake up call to put aside the distraction and act with the urgency that the situation demand the scottish national party decline to give this bill second would the minister for energy security and net zero the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart like to intervene already would be happy to take it this bill be as unnecessary much like the chuntering from sedentary position as it be unwelcome the prime minister no less claim that these measure would reduce energy bill but of course that be untrue and the secretary of state be well advise to distance herself from that fantasy it be claim that the bill will assist with the uk energy security but of course it will do no such thing give the combined effect of an international energy market and the vagary of the uk refining capacity which be increasingly and substantially incompatible with oil extract from the north sea basin the government seek to gaslight we with claim that there be strict test to be meet in order to issue any new licence when in fact these potemkin test will inevitably be meet for each and every licence application in the future should the bill pass the bill will not provide an evidence base assessment of all licence on case by case basis and as matter of actual fact new licence be grant in alone in the absence of any legislation of this nature and licensing round have be hold by the north sea transition authority every year and half since this propose legislation will in effect undermine the nsta by place statutory obligation on it to hold new licensing round every year rather than as and when it deem they necessary in its professional capacity as be currently the case moreover the nsta board unanimously agree that the legislation require annual licensing round be unnecessary but the government be advance it as means to guarantee unfettered access to continue hydrocarbon extraction that be not what we need the bill proponent would have we believe that have more licence will deliver low energy bill but it will achieve no such thing we all recognise that oil and gas will continue to be an essential part of our energy mix and as the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma say we use oil and gas certainly oil for more than combustible us so we will need measured and qualified licensing regime to accommodate an ongoing reliance on oil and gas as source of energy and much else but that be not what the bill propose the thing that be push up the price of household and commercial energy be not lack of licensing but the price of gas on the international market that consumer be force to pay not just for heating but for electricity give the bizarre pricing structure and how the uk be set up to favour gas that energy pricing disaster be compound by this government failure to invest properly in alternative such as large scale long duration storage solution which would dial considerable amount of gas out of the system and dial down price too fourteen year of tory mismanagement of our energy security have see barely sufficient investment go into renewable generation to meet the demand of the climate emergency and practically no investment go into the network to transmit this new energy that mean consumer be deny access to large swathe of cheap green renewable energy because of lack of grid capacity renewable energy once switch off to compensate for network be substitute by gas appreciate that the government be improve and invest in capital infrastructure but it be year too late the bill will not deliver energy security indeed the former chief executive of bp lord browne say that the government decision to expand north sea drilling be not go to make any difference to britain energy security and the former head of the nsta andy samuel say in that the introduction of new licence will make difference only around the edge what we need from the government be bold plan to far accelerate the electrification from renewable of our domestic energy market what we be present with be backward look cash grab for scotland hydrocarbon which come at the cost of just transition scotland will lose out by have our energy policy dictate by remote luddite westminster government who be relentlessly focus on the rear view mirror rather than on the future and job security the hon gentleman be talk about energy policy be direct by other people do he share my concern about our continued membership of the energy charter treaty which mean that any deal sign now will have to be fully remunerate on their potential hope value not their actual value even if they be phase out or cancel by sovereign britain or by sovereign scotland be neutral on the latter issue do the hon gentleman not think that like our european partner we should withdraw from the energy charter treaty to allow ourselves true energy independence agree entirely with the hon gentleman ambition on the energy charter treaty it be about time that the government get off the fence on the issue and make decision on job security let we be clear that this government care for oil and gas worker in scotland every bit as much as they care for the miner and the manufacture worker in scotland who be put to the sword in the every bit as much as they care for our service personnel live in squalor every bit as much as they care about the post office staff throw into the privatisation mincer and every bit as much as they care for junior doctor in england on my previous intervention refer the house to my declaration in the register of members financial interests on my falkland islands trip pay for by the falkland islands government the hon gentleman talk about the miner in rother valley we be hit hard by the closure of the mine which be why we need transition keep the new licence go will make the transition slightly long and keep more people in work surely it be good thing to diminish the negative impact that net zero will sometimes have on certain people the premise of the hon gentleman intervention be that by delay thing and maximise oil and gas production we somehow maintain this link we could just as easily deliver the same thing by accelerate the delivery of renewable energy and the infrastructure to transmit it to where it be need that would have the add benefit of introduce low bill for consumer and industry and make sure that we be not reliant on petrostate from far away with questionable regime be look through the right end of the telescope whereas the hon gentleman and his government be look through the wrong end in short the tories could not give fly fig for any worker on these island as long as their share price remain healthy to hang with the rest of we if the question be how do we protect and transition oil and gas job into renewable energy production the answer be definitely not to overstimulate unlimited offshore petroleum licensing accord to industry datum job be support by the oil and gas sector in but that number have already fall to so we be talk about few job in the government have issue approximately new drilling licence in five separate licensing round in that period the claim that there be direct and proportionate relationship between the amount of licence issue and the amount of job sustain be entirely spurious can the hon gentleman explain to the house and importantly his constituent in angus many of whom be employ in the industry what the scottish national party current position be on the issuing of new oil and gas licence at the moment do it support they or be there be presumption against they what be important be the understanding that we will be reliant on oil and gas this government be create false dichotomy between have unlimited new licence and have an oil and gas sector in scottish water and within the uk the two thing be not relate in the fashion that they be set out the hon gentleman should be ask why the uk government will not match the scottish government ambition for the just transition and our half billion pound of investment but will get on to that in second rise be the hon gentleman ask whether be give way for clarity no be not where be the guarantee ringfencing of revenue from north sea oil and gas production to develop more renewable energy and accelerate the just transition accelerate the just transition not unduly sustain legacy energy production will make the difference and deliver real job with sustainability in term of both the carbon output and how those job will last into the future where be that support the government have claim that the circa billion in tax revenue over the next five year could be use to support the shift to clean form of energy we be use to jam tomorrow from this government but any other form of fiscal revenue could be use to support the future development of renewable the vacuous observation that the government have make be so unconnected to reality unconditioned and unqualified as to be meaningless it would have be an uncharacteristically elegant solution for this government to have ringfence future oil and gas revenue for the green transition to marry the endowment of the legacy hydrocarbon industry to the priming of the pump of opportunity of the next renewable industry but this government be at least consistent in their ability to disappoint to the casualty of the climate from this bill which be an inevitable consequence of this course of action we can add the pace of delivery for the new net zero economy opportunity in scotland when oil and gas opportunity go to plateau of exhaustion in scotland as everyone know they will what will be leave in the cupboard to support community such as those in banff and buchan angus west aberdeenshire and kincardine and elsewhere in the north east of scotland why be the revenue from the historical exploitation of oil and gas not go into accelerate renewable opportunity and make sure that we deliver job for the future as say in response to the intervention by the hon member for moray douglas ross the scottish government have invest million into the green transition for well unlike anything to do with this bill that funding be allocate and be there to be invest will tell you why mr deputy speaker this government be nervous of that figure because if the uk be to match scotland ambition in the just transition it would be billion across the uk but we see no such commitment vision or climate ambition what we see be tory prime minister who can not effectively lead his party let alone the uk state or an energy transition seek to divide people on the climate and roll back on climate action commitment and signal give to industry on electric vehicle and boiler replacement while over exploit scotland legacy hydrocarbon and drag his foot on carbon capture usage and storage especially acorn the picture be reveal even for those with the large blinker the hallmark of failure be stamp on this tory government who will politicise anything even the climate consensus in vain attempt to stem their electoral destruction the bill fail to outline transition away from fossil fuel as per the agree resolution at on which the ink be barely dry the uk delegation sign up to that agreement in the full knowledge of this bill impend passage we all know that the uk have questionable approach to its international obligation but this be plain bad faith finally the bill do not acknowledge the climate emergency in fact with this bill the tory government be thumb their nose at the climate challenge that we all face together and should address together in the bill the government seek to over capitalise on legacy energy production rather than invest in the renewable energy job of the future much of that employment and enterprise will be in demand mitigation with thermal insulation equipment upgrade and new technology as result of the ambition that drive the bill and the warped thinking behind it job the economy bill payer and the climate will suffer so urge member to decline to give it second reading energy production either offshore in the form of oil and gas production and offshore wind or on the coast in the form of nuclear be of specific interest to the waveney constituency that represent the oil and gas industry have be significant employer locally for nearly year one of the large cluster of offshore windfarm in the world be locate off the east anglian coast and sizewell will bring significant job creation opportunity to the area to realise the full potential of the opportunity both nationally and locally we need the right policy fiscal and regulatory framework that satisfy the three criterion of energy security affordability and decarbonisation it be also necessary to provide investor with the confidence and certainty to invest in the uk it should be bear in mind that the market for energy capital be global footloose and highly competitive it be against that backdrop that we should judge the bill there be reason for support it but we must not lose sight of the need for long term stability and consistency in energy policy that be require to attract the enormous amount of private investment that we need to modernise and decarbonise our energy system and to make it more secure and resilient chair the all party parliamentary group for the british offshore oil and gas industry and highlight three factor that should be bear in mind in set energy policy first we be move away from business wherever they be in the supply chain that specialise in particular sector whether that be oil and gas offshore wind carbon capture or hydrogen such business be increasingly become all energy company that work in range of different sector secondly as have mention many such business be globally footloose and will operate anywhere in the world if we have policy regulatory and fiscal regime that be continuously flip flopping they will go elsewhere thirdly it should be emphasise that the vast majority of these company highlight those operate in east anglia be commit to net zero they regard it as both moral and legal obligation from which we should not be distract as have mention there be reason to support the bill and shall briefly highlight they first our energy policy be determine by the trinity of energy security affordability and decarbonisation recent geopolitical event in particular the russian invasion of ukraine and the conflict in the middle east have create major concern with regard to security of supply and unpredictability of price we have feel the backlash of the latter very harshly in the past two year and its impact have hit hard the poor and most vulnerable it be against that backdrop that it be sensible for the uk to be more energy independent and to use our own energy supply whether that be offshore wind nuclear or oil and gas secondly we need to reduce our reliance on oil and gas and indeed we have make good progress in do so as the uk have decrease oil production by since at the turn of the century we be produce million barrel of oil equivalent per day today that figure be below million and still fall however we still rely on oil and gas for much of our energy need and shall continue to do so albeit on significantly decline trajectory in the come decade it be in that context that it be logical to use our own oil and gas it should be point out as other have do that the carbon footprint of domestic gas production be around quarter of that associate with import and energy intensive liquefy natural gas thirdly at time of global economic uncertainty as well as geopolitical instability we need to have in mind the huge benefit that the oil and gas industry bring to our country domestic oil and gas production provide many job and add approximately billion to the uk economy each year while tax receipt be billion since and an estimate billion over the next five year fourthly as have mention today energy company operate across variety of sector and there be risk that if we close down the north sea too quickly we will imperil investment in new low carbon sector many company invest in nascent opportunity require cash flow from stable and predictable oil and gas business moreover freedom to explore can be major driver for investment on the uk continental shelf not only in oilfield and gasfield but in carbon capture and hydrogen production close the door on exploration reduce the option value of the uk as destination for overall investment finally it should be point out that most of the new licence that would be grant be near field adjoin exist one that mean that there would be lower incremental emission intensity as production will take place use exist facility it be important to emphasise that the bill be not panacea for the future of the north sea there be other work that the government must carry out alongside it one of the most notable achievement of the conservative government in recent year be the creation in of the oil and gas authority which now operate as the north sea transition authority it be regulatory authority that have achieve great deal and that have also recognise the vital importance of net zero the nsta great advantage over its predecessor which be embed in the department of energy and climate change be its independence of government there be worry that the bill undermine that independence and hope that in his sum up my right hon friend the minister will take on board and allay that concern the government should also consider provide the nsta with an enhanced role as the transition have become centre stage to the authority work the authority have take on additional regulatory responsibility for carbon capture usage and storage and hydrogen consideration should be give to add to that the oversight of the emerge geothermal sector an increase focus on the offshore energy supply chain and maximise the future use by low carbon technology of the infrastructure that have be lay down in the north sea over the past year we be at time in danger of talk glibly about just transition and the creation of new job we can help to achieve that in meaningful way by focus more strategically on skill and infrastructure be mindful that the regulatory space on the uk continental shelf be crowded as well as the nsta other organisation such as the marine management organisation and the crown estate be carry out important work we must ensure that all that work be properly co ordinated be effective in its precautionary objective and be not so overly bureaucratic as to deter investment mention that the majority of business work in the north sea be commit to the transition yes they want the government to be realistic and pragmatic about the future of the domestic oil and gas industry but they be also ambitious they want to be part of an industry that be in the vanguard of the transition from fossil fuel to renewable global leader on the road to net zero that should mean for example more ambitious climate compatibility checkpoint and bring forward the ban on routine venting and flaring the bill have merit but it need to be accompany by other measure some of which have outline to maximise the enormous amount of private investment that be require to decarbonise we also need to dispel any false notion among investor about the uk commitment to deliver on our net zero target as the government have state there be need for pragmatism proportionality and realism but that must be accompany by ambition consistency and clarity be very concerned that the bill will do much more harm than good member should not be fool that it will help with energy price or our commitment to net zero the energy secretary be quote as say that new production of oil and gas would necessarily bring energy bill down but could do so indirectly if the money raise in taxis be then use for renewable energy project do not understand the logic of that countless people include many of my constituent be in desperate need of low energy bill and be struggle to make end meet because of the endless price hike which the government have do little to abate do not believe that the bill will have any impact on that if the secretary of state know that renewable be the answer why be she not prioritise they rather than push forward with this illogical and damage bill bad than not prioritise they she be make the situation bad ernst young have find that the uk have become less attractive place to invest in renewable partly due to recent diminishing of green policy currently three quarter of north sea oil and gas operator invest nothing in uk renewable although we will all end up deal with the consequence of climate change it be other nation home and livelihood that will be destroy first the international development committee which chair conduct report on debt relief that find that low income country be more vulnerable to loss and damage from climate change than high income country even though they contribute the tiniest proportion of emission in our current inquiry into small island develop state we have hear that sids be particularly at risk from climate shock in this century alone two sids could disappear forever due to rise sea level low income country be be force to pay for damage that they do not cause and have the least ability to cope with meanwhile the conservative government want to hand out more licence in the north sea with no regard for how that could impact other country our own climate financing or marine life there be currently no provision in the bill to exempt marine protect area from oil and gas exploration find that an extraordinary omission it be absolutely crucial that no mpas be put at risk because of the bill by ignore that the government be jeopardise their own environment act target and their commitment to protect nature effectively in of the sea by under the global biodiversity framework mpa be design to safeguard some of the most vulnerable marine habitat and specie from irreversible damage as it stand only of english mpa offer effective protection for nature and of feature within they have be assess as already be in an unfavourable condition and that be before the bill go forward how will the government enhance the exist mpa when they can not even guarantee that they will not be destroy by this nonsensical bill an effective mpa framework would ensure that uk sea perform their vital function in the fight against climate change and boost biodiversity which be essential for functioning and sustainable fishing industry it would improve the resilience of marine specie to change condition and would continue to support the economic and recreational activity that be essential to so many people in the uk all those benefit would be jeopardise by allow oil and gas drilling within mpa the bill must be amend to ensure that mpa be completely off the table when oil and gas search and production block be consider whether it be oil spill underwater noise pollution or the direct destruction of habitat there be no doubt that there will be severe risk of harm to individual creature across population of marine wildlife and ultimately of disrupt entire ecosystem yet it appear the government be happy to do that if it mean even more profit for private industry we be suppose to be leader on the global stage we sign up to the paris agreement and agree to loss and damage fund but this government be destroy our international reputation and any ability they may have have to encourage other country to fulfil their climate obligation it sadden that it have come to this and urge the government to think again listen to their own mp especially the wise word of the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma and stop the bill now it be an honour to speak in the debate about the oil and gas sector the industry and the job that rely on it certainly in my moray constituency many people be employ in the sector they travel through to aberdeen to go off shore and it be regular commute for many people that be the case in town and village throughout moray such as buckie since have be able to get buckie into this debate on oil and gas it hopefully allow the opportunity to put on the record my appreciation to the club for an outstanding match against glasgow celtic yesterday at parkhead in the scottish cup they sadly lose but it be an outstanding game for the highland league team graeme stewart and his player do not just do the club the highland league community and buckie proud they come away with an absolute host of new fan because of what they achieve over the week since that game first come into the public domain it have be great to see cup fever in buckie and to see stalwart of the club such as annie jappy and sandra paterson recognise for everything they have do for the club over many year be sure the congratulation of everyone in the house go to buckie thistle on their achievement of course join my hon friend in congratulate buckie thistle but will he answer just one question which side play in the home strip of course they both play in green and white hoop celtic play in green and white and buckie be in yellow as say this be an important debate for many town village and community in moray because large number of people live in that area be employ in the oil and gas sector it be important for my constituent in moray and have be clear that it be right that we continue to grant new oil and gas licence to continue the exploration in the north sea while there be still demand that need to be supply but people will be leave wonder what be the current position of the snp that be why put very direct question to the hon member for angus dave doogan normally at this point would say that will give way to any snp member willing to intervene if they be able to answer but there be only one here would the hon gentleman like to intervene and say very simply to the people of angus and the people of scotland what his party position be and what his personal position be do the snp support the granting of new oil and gas licence yes or no thank the hon gentleman for this opportunity to reiterate what say previously there be fundamental understanding of the ongoing role of oil and gas in meet our energy need whether that be deal with and satisfied through exist licence or future licence be moot point and will tell he why have already demonstrate in as simple term as can that the implication that there be direct and proportional link between job security and licence issue be spurious be aware of the point he be try to make but he be not make it well have tell he what the situation be and he can either like it or lump it would just like an answer have try twice and that be as clear as mud think people look at that answer will actually be unable to tell what the hon gentleman personal position be and what the snp position be that be really important maybe it be tell that only one snp mp have turn up to debate about the oil and gas sector have you see the weather have see the weather see the weather when leave inverness airport at this morning know what the weather be like in scotland but it be important that when we be debate the oil and gas industry which be crucial to scotland and the united kingdom the snp can find only one mp to turn up do the hon gentleman accept that for the employee of the oil and gas industry in scotland and the across the united kingdom an answer that say it be moot point be hardly the right one to give it look more like mute position adopt by some of the opposition member in this debate absolutely agree with the right hon gentleman people should watch closely what the hon member for angus say on his own behalf and on behalf of the snp as say snp mp be speak with their action tonight by not even turn up to the debate opponent of this bill the labour party the snp and other try to present our energy transition and support for oil and gas as binary choice they say that we can not achieve our net zero goal while at the same time support new oil and gas licence and project but nothing could be far from the truth the oil and gas sector in scotland and across the uk be essential to deliver and achieve net zero the investment in green energy infrastructure that will allow we to build our renewable capacity be come from the revenue from oil and gas extraction the business that be look to expand offshore wind and the windfarm for tomorrow be stay solvent today because of their revenue from north sea oil and gas the people with the skill and expertise that we have hear about throughout this debate which will be require to secure our offshore renewable go forward work in our oil and gas sector today that be why it be so important that make the point to the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband that people such as sir ian wood be say that labour plan and the cliff edge that labour would impose on the sector would see job loss that be why that position be frankly unacceptable and be not support by many people if any in the north east of scotland the business the investment and the job that make scotland and the uk world leader in oil and gas be the same skill business and job that be go to drive forward the green agenda and our renewable future we can not have one without the other we can not tell investor business and worker who pause their plan for the uk energy infrastructure due to an artificial ban on new field to come back when the green technology have become cheap or more viable because those investor those business and those worker will go elsewhere say to the hon member for angus that that be not moot point that be the reality if we do not continue with the exploration of oil and gas in the north sea and the granting of new licence be sure that my hon friend will join in welcome the vast number of offshore wind project be develop off the coast of our respective constituency as well as that of the hon member for angus dave doogan and the operation and maintenance facility in buckie in his constituency and fraserburgh in mine which be entirely dependent on those offshore wind facility as much as people from the oil and gas industry be move into they there be just not enough of those job to make up for those that we would lose in oil and gas do he agree that lot of the people who work in oil and gas would not go to renewable if there be no oil and gas job but would just go where there be oil and gas overseas absolutely agree with my hon friend we have base at buckie harbour that be support number of job and will continue to do so for decade to come it be small number of job at the moment with opportunity to grow but at the moment the vast majority of the workforce be employ in the oil and gas sector agree with he that they will go elsewhere shift their job and expertise to other country and another city will become europe offshore energy capital that would be devastating not just for our net zero ambition and for aberdeen but for the economy of scotland and the uk as whole we have already hear in the debate that scottish worker be employ in north sea oil and gas it have be for decade and will continue to be for some time to come one of the most important sector in scotland economy yet believe that it be the position of the snp it would be if more snp members than just the hon member for angus have turn up to state their case to put those job on the scrapheap the snp want to have cliff edge in our oil and gas sector and exploration because it be in government with the greens in the scottish parliament it be support green ministers who want an immediate end to the extraction of fossil fuel from the north east and that be put those job and the scottish and uk economy at risk that be view extremely dimly in many part of scotland particularly the north east which the hon member for angus represent it be bit rich listen to scottish tory mp talk about the bountiful experience of north sea oil and gas for scotland if we have be independent in the we would be embarrassingly well off compare with our neighbour elsewhere in these island the hon member say that we want to throw worker in the oil and gas industry in scotland under bus and that we want to see cliff edge where those job disappear what be his evidence for that we be invest in just transition whereas he be try to pursue an endurance of legacy opportunity for employment we want to turbocharge new opportunity for job over to year my evidence be very clear in fact it be the hon gentleman own word when he can not even tell this house or his constituent about the snp position on the presumption of new oil and gas licence that be an answer in itself not moot point the snp clearly do not support it and he can not quite find the word to say it yet that be the snp position because it be in office with the greens in holyrood and they be increasingly abandon the north east oil and gas sector and the job that rely on it as say that be view extremely dimly not just in the north east but right across scotland nobody be talk about turn off oil and gas tap overnight nobody not even just stop oil so will the hon gentleman cut the amount of rubbish come out of his mouth he be criticise people who be not here in any number to be able to defend themselves why do he not focus on his own record rather than attack other in such an erroneous way it be not erroneous because we know that the co leader of the scottish greens patrick harvie have say that he would like to stop oil and gas exploration overnight that be the green position they do not want oil and gas to come out of the north sea and that will affect job there right now that be the point that and indeed other hon member have be make will the hon gentleman give way have already give way to the hon lady and can see that she have copious note in her hand so she will be contribute to the debate have already take some time so will continue my speech the snp will put those job on the scrapheap and turn its back on the north east of scotland yet at the same time humza yousaf be tell the people of scotland that oil and gas revenue will pay for an independent scotland the snp do not want to take the oil and gas out but it want to get the benefit to pay for fail public service in scotland which it have let down during its year in power of course labour and scottish labour be also opposed to the bill frankly it be quite derisory that msp and the scottish labour party will not stand up for the north east of scotland and will allow those job skill and the expertise gain over decade to be lose the stark reality be that the opposition party be put ten of thousand of scottish job at risk and put the uk energy security in jeopardy when we need it most when illiberal violent regime such as putin russia be use energy resource as means of fund their destructive war we can not close our eye and ear and pretend it be not happen the uk will still have demand for oil and gas product and not just in energy but as we have hear in plastic and medicine to name just few that demand will not go away in an instant many of the home that rely on those product and heating will require they for many year to come why should we not try to deliver on as much of that demand as we can through domestic production import our energy will only increase emission far and help those intent on manipulate energy market for malign purpose urge member to support the bill let we secure the uk energy future and deal blow to the regime that be intent on use energy as weapon let we protect our economy and the livelihood of ten of thousand of scottish and british family across the country let we choose common sense practical transition to net zero not naivety and wishful thinking let the labour and snp members present explain in their speech why they will join together to try to vote down the bill and the opportunity that oil and gas will continue to bring scotland and the uk for decade to come rise to oppose the government offshore petroleum licensing bill for which there be absolutely no need it will do nothing to bring down people energy bill either domestic or business and will severely damage the uk reputation in the world moreover as understand it production from the new field would be export when labour be in government be privileged to have the opportunity to work with my right hon friend the member for leeds central hilary benn on the climate change act ground break world first that lead the way on tackle climate change my right hon friend the member for doncaster north edward miliband become the secretary of state for energy and climate change and he work hard not only on renewable at home but on ensure that the uk be take the lead on the world stage in respect of climate change now just as there have be grow consensus around the globe on the urgent need to tackle climate change it seem that we have government who no long want to give that leadership even petroleum produce country such as oman be now invest heavily in renewable but we have prime minister who be not even sure if he want to attend cop meeting we have vacuous anti green rhetoric and now we have this bill it make the uk look ridiculous on the world stage not to say hypocritical that with our proud history of urge other nation to do more to tackle climate change and reduce reliance on fossil fuel and sign agreement to that effect include recently at the uk be now prioritise bill to promote the exploration of more oilfield with production at who know what future date what the government should be do be prioritise the roll out of renewable so often during oral question we hear the minister for energy security and net zero boast about the roll out of renewable but he should reflect on how much more the uk could and should have do by now first there be the wind farm ban in england even now when the government talk as if they be plan to lift the ban the situation be completely ambiguous and they have not promote wind power enthusiastically just think if there have not be ban in england we would have have additional capacity on top of what wales and scotland provide near to the big centre of population we all know that the government have not move fast enough to strengthen the national grid to transport the electricity from the wind farm where it be produce to the centre of population then we have the fiasco of the last auction process allocation round where the government do not receive single bid for float offshore wind because of their stubborn refusal to sit down with the industry and recognise the huge impact of inflation and the need to alter the price structure accordingly the irish government listen to the industry and conduct successful auction we also see the complacency of the minister the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart when he come to this house and say oh well there another chance to bid for next year lose valuable time and send worrying signal to the industry about the government commitment to develop float offshore wind as we hear from my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion investor now lack confidence in invest in the uk because they simply do not know which direction this government be go in could go on we could have see lot more progress on solar and marine technology those be some of the thing the government could be do if they listen to the industry instead of waste time on this bill the uk marine energy council have identify the barrier to the roll out of tidal stream energy lack of clarity on future support which be damage investor confidence consenting process that be slow and onerous lack of innovation funding the cost of set up supply chain and lack of grid capacity the same could be say about many other emerge renewable technology and that be where the government energy should be concentrate not on this ridiculous bill on electrification of the railway when labour leave government in there be plan to electrify the line from london to swansea we then have the ridiculous pantomime of the tories cancel cardiff to swansea reinstate it and cancel it again the right hon member for carmarthen west and south pembrokeshire simon hart who be then secretary of state for wales and be now the chief whip say that electrification be pointless as the nature of the track mean that train would not go any fast but that completely miss the point as anyone who have be in the square in front of the station in cardiff know the pollution the carbon emission and the noise from the diesel engine tell we exactly why we should be push on with electrification to reduce our emission instead we have this bill to extract more oil and gas from the north sea rather than move away by produce renewable and ensure that our industry and our transport can operate on clean energy that be what the government priority should be as for job the people work in the oil and gas industry have valuable skill and we must make absolutely sure that they have the opportunity to move across to other similar industry renewable and infrastructure for that the government need clear industrial strategy and to provide proper retrain opportunity for those who need to do so of course the way to improve job opportunity be to ramp up the speed and scale of renewable development there be question early about labour policy will not detain member by read all page of our plan to make the uk renewable energy superpower which can be find on our website but to be brief we be absolutely committed to slash people energy bill by make the uk renewable energy superpower create the new green job of the future and ensure just transition if we win the next election we will create great british energy to be publicly own champion of clean energy generation we have plan for national wealth fund that would invest alongside the private sector in the job of the future such as in clean steel plant and our plan be underpin by proper industrial strategy that will give investor confidence on that note suggest that the government drop this bill and turn their attention and energy to develop our renewable sector and make sure we can proudly lead the world on just transition to fossil free world we all want healthy planet and sustainable future for the next generation but no one want the heating to go off the light to go out or our energy security to be at the mercy of foreign player in an ever more unstable world this bill recognise that do nothing and increase our reliance on import gas include gas with four time the emission be not the solution as such be glad that the government acknowledge the need to move away from oil and gas production and welcome our long term commitment to drive down the use of fossil fuel and the significant and grow investment in the renewable sector which be the only way to guarantee our energy security for the future but it be for the future as country we be now home to five of the large offshore wind farm in the world diversify our energy supply and reduce our reliance on fossil fuel renewable gain enough power in to avoid the need for five time as much gas as the uk import from russia in however as we discuss the bill we should reflect on how we make that transition while preserve our reputation as global leader in the fight against climate change be keen to see further effort to reassure the international community and our constituent who care about the environment that we be not row back on our climate and environmental commitment our current requirement be low than recommend pathway to reach net zero so suggest that we continue to strengthen the operational emission requirement for uk oil and gas producer recent report from robert gordon university find that of the uk oil and gas workforce have skill that be transferable to the offshore renewable sector well manage transition help ensure that more investment and more of those job stay in the uk opposition members have no plan labour and the snp be ignore the country energy need in their opposition to the bill which seek to enable transition pathway for an industry that last year produce an average of of gas on an average day in britain without new development we will be more reliant on import which be unwise at well give the instability in the european market as result of putin war labour talk about expand renewable and reduce usage through measure such as insulation the government share that ambition but it be impossible to deliver at speed and in area such as stoke on if opposition member will listen will give they the reason why there be many terrace house in those area where the cost of insulate property to the high energy performance certificate standard can be great than the value of that property for that reason there need to be broad discussion about housing refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests recently visit norway with the conservative environment network to see how that country be use the skill and expertise of the oil and gas industry to develop carbon capture and storage facility at the northern lights project for the world to achieve the goal to which we have commit ourselves in the paris agreement we need large scale carbon capture and storage not all emission can be cut by apply renewable energy oil and gas will be need for the foreseeable future however reduce fossil fuel demand be key to reach net zero in several industrial process such as the production of cement carbon capture and storage be the only technology that can cut emission reduce the need for import energy and benefit household through less volatile and ultimately low energy cost the hon lady talk about the enormous cost of insulation but be she clear that carbon capture and storage be also enormously expensive be clear that lot of thing have cost but we must also look at the cost of not do they we be not talk purely about financial cost to return to what learn from my trip to norway about fifth of emission from north sea oil and gas production activity come from flare we could follow norway ban on those activity be sure the hon member for bath wera hobhouse would agree with that use the bill to bring forward our commitment to stop flare will the hon lady give way would like to get on if the hon lady do not mind interruption she be chuntere from sedentary position remove gas be necessary for safety however it can be capture rather than burn that be my argument we be in the midst of paradigm shift in the production storage and supply of energy and we be face with range of innovative option to decarbonise while maintain an adequate energy supply and reduce usage none of this will happen overnight and while we welcome the possibility of innovation such as less energy wastage through battery storage alternative fuel such as hydrogen future solution such as the expansion of nuclear and alternative such as tidal and geothermal energy we do need this transition position will be support the bill on second reading but on report will look at possibility for reconfirm our commitment to minimise environmental damage and continue focus on the end game of clean solution to our energy need refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests mr deputy speaker know you be not around at the time but you will know that the stone age do not end because of lack of stone and the oil age will not end because of lack of oil it will end because decent people of all political persuasion such as the former right hon member for kingswood be farsighte enough to recognise and brave enough to stand up against the vested interest that would consign our child and the natural world to costly disruptive and frankly terrify future he be right to say that history will judge harshly those who continue down the reckless fossil fuel path that this bill represent this bill be found upon lie in fact several lie the government say it will safeguard our domestic energy supply and boost investment it will not they say it will enhance our energy security and reduce our dependence on import from overseas it will not the truth be that it be political distraction that will reduce investment in and delay our transition to the clean energy that be the only sustainable and secure future both for our country and for the global community this bill be not credible plan to fix britain break energy system it be sad attempt to sew division and polarise our politic it show that the government have give up govern and be out of step with the british people priority when million people live in fuel poverty and when people die last winter as result of live in cold damp home this bill fall well below what our constituent deserve as the world hot year on record be conclude nearly country agree at to transition away from fossil fuel the contrast between the promise make in dubai and what the government seek to do today could not be more profound nor more depressing by invite parliament to enable annual licensing round for offshore oil and gas extraction the government be fail to understand that to transition away from fossil fuel we have to stop produce they the government argue but it be still decline field this simply slow the rate of decline they say the problem be that it also slow the rate of investment in just transition that will unleash the power of wind solar tidal and energy efficiency the north sea be decline basin its reserve be predominantly oil not gas between now and new licence be expect to provide just day of gas which be four day of gas on average each year the government know that once oil and gas be license it belong to the company that hold the licence as the government recently admit to my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle of uk oil reserve be send abroad by these company and sell on the international market to the high bidder no wonder the former executive director of bp say last year that the government decision to expand north sea drilling be not go to make any difference to britain energy security if the government ambition be to minimise gas import there be very simple solution insulate home the good way to cut import be to reduce domestic fossil fuel consumption by build renewable and insulate home this would have the additional benefit of reduce people energy bill and tackle fuel poverty by channel investment into oil and gas the government be head precisely in the wrong direction do not deny that there be role for exist oil and gas but it be in the journey to clean energy economy what there be not role for be the production of new oil and gas we already know that to stand chance of keep below the threshold of the world coal reserve and of oil and gas reserve would have to stay in the ground be the hon member aware of this he mention the pathway to the target and the iea description of what be require be to reduction in oil and gas production year on year between now and do he agree with the assessment of the nsta itself which expect that even with the new oil and gas licence north sea oil and gas be predict to decline by or twice that amount be well aware of that of course be but the hon member will have hear the discussion that take place early about global leadership he will know that other country around the world be not decline at the require rate and leadership be about take lead the logic of drill for more when the world have already more than it can safely burn be that of the myopic salesman not the visionary politician or to use the prime minister word it be the logic of the zealot the government action be already make the uk less attractive place for green investment three quarter of all north sea oil and gas operator currently invest nothing at all in uk renewable the large operator harbour energy have rule out such clean investment altogether yet last year the five oil super major bp shell chevron exxonmobil and totalenergies reward their investor with record payout of more than billion so we know the money be there to do it will the hon gentleman give way the minister be ask whether will give way the right hon member have long confuse the scoring of party political point with the ability to debate an issue to arrive at the truth and get decent policy out the other end however if he have change the habit of lifetime will happily give way to he thank the hon gentleman he mention specific company harbour energy and it be absolutely invest in the viking carbon capture centre and play positive role that be true of the whole oil and gas supply chain in this country which the hon gentleman if he go to visit they would find be work right across the energy sector weaken one part as he would with no new licence would damage the new clean emerge sector too recognise the work that harbour energy be do and also recognise the work that the government have do in try to attract more investment into green energy and renewable and welcome that work want we to have cross party consensus around get to net zero the trouble be that and the minister know this to be true he and many people on his side include the prime minister have try to make this wedge issue political issue to divide people think he really do need to step up to the plate if he want cross party consensus he have to try to build it not score cheap political point the liberal democrats be actually introduce an amendment to stop flare and venting of methane the hon member for stoke on trent central jo gideon have just say it would be very good thing to do yet the government oppose it that be an example of where we could have reach cross party consensus the hon lady be absolutely correct and listen to her attempt to intervene on the hon member for stoke on trent central jo gideon we need to build cross party consensus and this show how it can be achieve there be concerned member on the government benches who want to do the right thing and we all know that sometimes the whip make sure that they do not but if we really build this consensus we can get to the right place another lie at the heart of this bill be to say it will protect british job it will not over the year there have be hundred of thousand of job in the oil and gas sector and its supply chain they have keep our light on and our industry move for decade just as the coalminer do before they but pretend that employment in oil and gas can last forever fail to properly prepare those worker and their family for the inevitable transition that the world be make despite sustained support for the north sea basin over the past year and despite new drilling licence be issue across five separate licensing run the fact be that more than job in the oil and gas industry and its wide supply network have be lose today hard work people be directly employ in the industry those worker and the local economy they uphold need coherent plan to move past fossil fuel production towards clean energy the trouble be the government have not develop one further individual be support through the supply chain and be wait for signal from government so that they can seize the opportunity of the clean energy revolution this bill offer they nothing it seem to override the already weak non bind climate compatibility checkpoint the production emission reduction target set out in the north sea transition deal be already weak set cut of only by this bill seem to weaken it even far it include no reference to how annual licensing will be judge against the nstd target for production emission let alone emission from combustion critically the bill ignore the wide environmental consequence of the development of new field and put marine habitat at risk over one third of the location in the late licensing round overlap with marine protect area yet this directly contradict the commitment the uk make at the convention on biological diversity conference in montreal where we promise to protect of uk water for nature by the rosebank field that be recently license see pipeline run through the faroe shetland marine protect area which threaten ocean life if major oil spill from rosebank be to happen mpa could be seriously impact this bill be an attack on nature both by its indirect impact through increase emission and its direct impact on the marine environment the government appear to believe that they know well than the international energy agency the united nations secretary general the intergovernmental panel on climate change and hundred of the world lead scientist all of whom be clear that new oil and gas licence jeopardise far the goal of this parliament own independent adviser the climate change committee confirm to parliament only last year that the expansion of fossil fuel production be not in line with net zero and that the oil and gas field that be require in the uk as we make that journey to net zero do not require the development of any new field but what find most depressing about this bill be not its arrogance or its ignorance it be the way it seek to break with the cross party consensus for the sake of create party political dividing line in advance of general election that divide line pretend that the rational inform scientific view be hold only by what the prime minister call climate zealot and it try to establish the recalcitrant fossil fuel lobby that be endanger all we hold dear across the globe as the reasonable middle ground it be not as the united nations secretary general antónio guterres say the truly dangerous radical be the country that be increase the production of fossil fuel the fossil fuel lobby be behave like the tobacco lobby do when all of the medical evidence be against it first deny the science outright when that be no long credible pretend that the concern be exaggerated and when that be no long credible reframe the issue as one of personal choice government be about establish framework of regulation for the public good it be not about facilitate the freedom of those who would undermine the public good that be why this bill be bad for democracy that be why this bill be bad for our global standing as country that have previously be regard as leader on this issue that leadership be now pass to other who be respond positively to the pledge in dubai to transition away from fossil fuel by join the beyond oil and gas alliance the flood that we be see devastate community and live around the country be but foretaste of the terrifying impact of climate change beyond this bill do nothing to mitigate they it do nothing to support the billion of people across the world who live on the frontline of climate breakdown it ignore the plight of million of bill payer who find themselves price out of our broken energy system and it ignore the worker who power our country this bill endanger our natural world and future generation can not support it will consign it to the same vote of no confidence that predict await this government later on this year want to start by remind the house in the interest of transparency that for year prior to be an mp work in the energy sector specifically the oil and gas sector have not make secret of that in the past by the way also in the interest of transparency note that have close family member who have financial interest in that industry although feel keen to point out that that interest be below the threshold require for register interest can also assure the house that that interest have never have any bearing and will not have any bearing on my contribution in this place we be not nation that need to be convince of the need to transition away from oil and gas the minister for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart say on his return from that he be proud to represent country that have cut greenhouse gas emission more than any other major economy since that have boost our share of renewable electricity from rather dismal in to almost half today think we have exceed since he say that while almost entirely phase out coal power that have lead the world in mobilise green finance and that be now ensure that we bring the british public with we on the transition to net report december vol we have essentially transition away completely from coal and continue to reduce our demand for oil and gas but not as fast as our own domestic supply continue to decline even with new production one of the critical point that need to be make when consider this propose legislation be that new oil and gas do not mean more oil and gas it be important to state few basic fact that will hopefully help people understand why this bill aim at promote and facilitate new oil and gas production in this country be not in contradiction to deliver on our net zero target and global agreement and commitment we be today dependent on oil and gas for our energy need not just for electricity generation but for heat and transportation as well of that about be produce domestically with the rest need to be import include from norway as have be say even by we will be at net zero and still up to dependent on oil and gas even with new oil and gas exploration and production couple with that decline in demand we be extremely unlikely to have net surplus ever again the uk have be net importer of oil and gas since long after our own production profile peak in the late there be currently active oil and gas field in the north sea and the offshore energies uk trade body estimate that by around of those that be more than have cease production due to natural decline if we do not replace those deplete oil and gas field with new one production will decline much fast than we can build low carbon source to replace it it be worth remember as point out early that even with the new oil and gas field and well we can reasonably predict that we be still look at year on year reduction in uk production accord to the north sea transition authority that be twice as fast as the international energy agency recommend it suggest that the global reduction of oil and gas production need to be about half that at to year to stay within our target in line with the climate change committee balanced pathway the uk demand for oil and gas will reduce over time and be forecast to be approximately billion barrel of oil equivalent cumulatively over the period through to however exist domestic field be expect to deliver only between billion and billion barrel of oil equivalent so we can see the gap that be the import gap which we need to fill through import new field development and license be require to reduce our reliance on overseas import without new investment it be predict that reliance on overseas import will increase from today to close to by if demand for oil and gas be to continue which it will albeit it will be decline in the come decade it make sense to get it from as close to our own shore as possible reduce demand for oil and gas be key not reduce supply think we can all agree that we need to do that simply reduce or cut off our domestic supply will not help net zero to happen any fast or any more successfully it will only make we more dependent on foreign import there be other factor to consider we have all hear today about the or so job dependent on the oil and gas industry those people be directly employ by the oil and gas industry and protect those job and livelihood and understand the impact that an industry have on community and society as well as on our local and national economy be extremely important my big worry go beyond that it be not necessarily that those people will become unemployed some of they may find job in the burgeon renewable sector and as discuss with my hon friend the member for moray douglas ross we be see that in our constituency although in the short to medium term there be not enough of those job to go around but about the potential loss of precisely the skill technology and supply chain that will be crucial to the delivery of the energy transition if we shut down this critical industry too soon those skill and supply chain will merely go overseas and deliver someone else energy security and transition for the past year the north sea offshore industry have be see as centre of excellence in the global oil and gas industry nowhere in the world be oil and gas produce more safely efficiently cleanly and environmentally responsibly the former right hon member for kingswood and my right hon friend the member for reading west sir alok sharma have say that we be clean energy superpower that have decarbonise fast than any other nation we have reduce our emission by at the same time as grow our economy above level to quote the former right hon member for kingswood that be paragon and model that all other nation look report november vol where the former right hon member for kingswood and do not agree be that far from damage that reputation we have build over decade we have the opportunity to maintain and build on that perception as centre for excellence for produce oil and gas well and more safely and cleanly than anyone else and for decarbonise fast than anyone else rather than for virtue signal well than anybody else as the opposition appear to be seek to do welcome the bill and the increase certainty that it bring to the offshore energy industry business and the people with the skill and talent who work in those company they will help to deliver not only our energy security for year to come but successful energy transition to net zero we can not just show the world that it can be do but lead the world in show how it can be do agree with lot of what the hon member for banff and buchan david duguid say even though disagree with the purpose of the bill which seem to to be political grandstanding indicative only of it be an election year it entirely fail to meet the significant need of those who be currently struggle to heat their home in scotland of the scottish economy which should be bask in all the glory and wealth that have be create through oil and gas or of our wide planet we need to transition that be self evident it be not simply about the global warming that member have be talk about train in my constituency be cancel today and the be close because lorry have overturn it be heavy good vehicle but not high sided one the strength of the wind that batter the community in my constituency and elsewhere do that we have serious problem come down the line and we require to change but it require to be just transition at pace that allow we to change because we have to ensure that we keep the skill we can not do to those in the oil and gas sector what be do by thatcher to the miner and simply close they down and throw they to the wolf we have to ensure that we transition to renewable but oil and gas be require for we to make that journey can see it in the hill of the lammermuirs and see it on daily basis as increase number of wind turbine go into the firth of forth at the end of the day the ship put in the column for the turbine run on marine diesel lot of the turbine require plastic to be construct and we also need the vehicle simply to get they there we have to get to that renewable future the tragedy in scotland be that we be already there as we produce almost as much energy as we require our people just do not get the benefit of it because it be transmit south and charge at an appalling rate when it should be almost free give that people can see it from their home on their hill and off their shore there have to be change there be also perversity although agree with new licensing rosebank will be operate and own by equinor the state energy company of norway so the profit will go to oslo scotland and norway discover oil at the same time because we share access to the north sea basin those in norway have standard of living and an economy that those in scotland can only look at and weep with envy they also have future fund because they put the money away rather than allow the super rich to get even rich and invest in foreign bank account or highland estate norway have future fund and scotland have precisely nothing we have to continue to build and to continue extract oil and gas that have to be at significant pace for scotland while take into account the need to meet the requirement of the planet two particular aspect be need first as per the amendment in my name and that of my group leader my hon friend the member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey we must have commitment to net zero carbon footprint in particular that mean take into account the need of carbon capture scotland have have the bounty of north sea oil and we need to ensure we continue to get benefit from it we have come the bounty of renewable and we see that with offshore wind both float and fix but we also have huge potential with carbon capture because the geology of the north sea provide something like of the opportunity in europe yes carbon capture be untested but our society and our planet need it more importantly we must have commitment to retain refinery at grangemouth it be absurd as other have say today that the oil from the north sea be ship abroad in the main to be refine and then we import from supertanker come in those ship pass on the high sea and that be simply absurd as we have worsen planet crisis it be perverse it be not good enough to say it the wrong type of oil just as we would not accept rail operate company say that it be the wrong type of leaf on the track yes our refinery be not at the capacity for the engineering or technical skill to refine it but that should be do the first place to do that be grangemouth why because the forties pipeline come into grangemouth as the hon member for banff and buchan know it land at cruden bay in his constituency but it be pip down to grangemouth it be absurd that grangemouth should be close when the oil both past and present and indeed future be come in from the north sea so if there be to be the continued extraction of scotland need which we have not benefit from because we do not have the wealth or saving of norway we must at least ensure that we save grangemouth call on the uk government first to ensure that they provide the fund for the hydrocracker that will increase the profitability of the exist site threefold if that be do that would cost fraction of the billion the uk have get from north sea oil over the year and fraction of what it will continue to take in petroleum revenue tax and other benefit in come year we must ensure that we get the profitability up then in couple of year we must take the engineering the skill and the technology so that the oil from the north sea can be refine in grangemouth it be absurd and perverse that that be not do do the hon member accept that one of the reason why we have not have investment in the refining industry in the united kingdom for decade be precisely because the net zero policy that be be follow with the cost and charge for carbon the emission trading scheme and other carbon taxis discourage any investment in the very production facility we use to process the oil that we bring out think there be variety of factor and have no doubt that some of those factor be there there have also be failure to invest where the blame do not lie be with workforce who be skilled and who presently have to work with refinery that be past its sell by date and require to be invest in even the union and the workforce recognise that investment be require to get the hydrocracker go and to get the technology to ensure that we refine the oil there it be probably not the current owner petroineos but previous owner who have take the benefit for themselves and invest it in their shareholder rather than put it back into either the workforce or indeed capacity at the refinery tragically that happen across so much of uk industry whether the shipyard the steelwork or whatever else we see government who will benefit from north sea oil continue extraction so the least that scotland be entitle to expect be its refinery to be at the heart of that especially when the oil will flow down that golden thread in the forties pipeline down to grangemouth we require to ensure that grangemouth will refine it yes that require technical change and yes that will come at cost but that be small fraction of what the uk will take from the benefit of that north sea oil that be why the alba party support be conditional on carbon capture and the net zero footprint and also conditional on grangemouth be at its heart it be absurd that scotland be not get the wealth from the oil off its shore it be absurd that while country have see their desert redevelop and bloom because of the oil they have have what we have see with north sea oil be an industrial desert create have be bring up only or mile from grangemouth know the devastation that will come to that community unless there be the change require to ensure that grangemouth do the refining for north sea oil we can not afford to have grangemouth throw to the wolf as say in last week debate we can not have grangemouth no more we require to ensure refinery capacity it would be absurd for scotland in the uk to have in grangemouth no refinery capacity scotland would be rank in the nation that produce oil and the only one in the top without refinery capacity the only other country that tend not to have refinery capacity be the like of the republic of congo and trinidad and tobago wish those country no ill be sure they be fine country but they do not produce the same level of oil and they be not develop industrial economy the fact of the matter be that scotland should not be in that same position of be an oil produce nation without refinery capacity on that basis grangemouth must be retain call on the government to do that my only additional point be that the scottish government too require to step up to the plate the fact that the business and economy secretary in scotland appear to be accept the closure of grangemouth as something that just will happen and be maybe matter of regret be simply unacceptable he may be in coalition with the greens but he can not have they wag the snp dog it be simply unacceptable that we see grangemouth close without fight the scottish government should be lead the demand that the refinery be change that we do ensure the hydrocracker that we do provide the change to refine in scotland and that we do move towards biofuel what they should not be do be wring their hand and sell out the grangemouth workforce we require refinery capacity in scotland the uk government have have the benefit of scotland oil and should pay for it and it be about time that the scottish government stand up for industrial scotland and the worker who at one point put their trust and faith in they we be no stranger to hyperbole in this chamber but think the exaggeration of the importance of this bill in the debate have surprise even government members to hear opposition members we would think that the government have make bold announcement to reject their policy on climate change to deny the science and to minimise the impact of climate change and to say that we be no long commit to decarbonise by none of that be even remotely true nothing have change in relation to the government policy on climate change and decarbonisation in particular in fact the prime minister recently reaffirm that the united kingdom recently pass the substantial marker of be the first of any major economy to more than halve its emission that be huge milestone and that be the kind of climate leadership that be important not make virtue signal announcement in this chamber or elsewhere country around the world look at we because of what we do and we be decarbonise and lead by example will take no lesson from the labour party look this up during the debate in on labour watch the economy emit million tonne of equivalent now it be million tonne and decline that be as result of conservative policy in action where we accept the science on climate change but take positive action on the really important thing it be the amount of oil and carbon we use that be important not where it come from the conservative record be incredibly strong but we still recognise as do the climate change committee that we need oil and gas as part of our long term future currently as my hon friend the member for banff and buchan david duguid point out about of our energy come from hydrocarbon oil and gas that be reduce but it be on trajectory to get to about even in and beyond the hon member be take the climate change committee name in vain it do not say that we need new oil and gas it say categorically that new exploration of oil and gas be not compatible with our net zero obligation do not understand why he be claim something that be different from what the committee say he compare emission under labour government with those under tory government be no apologist for the labour government but wonder whether he put consumption emission into those calculation do he work out whether emission have go down in the uk because we have outsource even more of our manufacturing to country on the other side of the world be grateful to the hon lady for that intervention the climate change committee give we the science and the political decision be take in this house we be not talk about an increase in exploration we be talk about manage reduction of per annum move on the question be not whether we have oil or gas yes or no we need oil and gas certainly for the transition period between and and even beyond accord to the climate change committee around of our energy will still come from oil and gas the question be where should that oil and gas come from if we need to supply this economy with oil and gas it be my belief that we should use uk oil and gas and there be reason for that the first be that the industry employ people would prefer that employment to remain in the uk economy rather than export it to russia qatar saudi arabia or other oil and gas produce country that be reasonable position give that our consumption be require for the future the second reason be geopolitical we need an alternative to russian gas and not just in this country accept the point make early by opposition members that oil and gas be global market and that of north sea oil be export to europe but emission be global and so be the geopolitic it be right and in our strategic interest that europe should have viable alternative to russia for the supply of hydrocarbon we have see in the last two year the awful consequence of an overreliance on the russian supply of hydrocarbon and more so in europe germany in particular than in the united kingdom we have become net exporter of gas to mainland europe little from the north sea but lot from milford haven qatari liquid natural gas be import into our country and transport by the connector to mainland europe the europeans be suck up very pollute liquid natural gas because they do not have viable clean alternative which north sea gas would provide it have be point out to that gas in qatar be produce at broadly equivalent carbon footprint to ours but the compression into liquid the transportation and the de liquefaction when it get into this country quadruple that carbon footprint my hon friend be right opposition members have no answer to that in germany in particular misguided green policy have lead to the extraordinary decision to decommission the low carbon nuclear industry and replace it with coal fire power station could hardly make it up germany be massively increase its reliance on import liquid natural gas which be much more polluting than the clean more local and geopolitically more stable alternative of north sea gas and oil the third reason why would prefer that we use uk oil and gas be that it pay uk tax be not ashamed to say that welcome that if we be to extract hydrocarbon that will be tax prefer for that tax to be pay in the united kingdom rather than in some other country just between and it be estimate that those tax receipt will amount to billion we know how much trouble opposition members have try to explain where they will get their billion of borrow each year and how that will raise interest rate debt and inflation that would be more than double if they get their way and their policy destroy the north sea oil and gas sector the hon gentleman mention what the government be spend not spend and tax but could he mention how much they actually spend on subsidy for the oil and gas industry just number number be mention early in the debate but do not catch it be sure that the hon lady might have that number in mind it be right that we support industry in this country because they create employment generate economic activity and in turn pay taxis be not ashamed of that because it be good thing the final reason why want oil and gas extraction in this country if we be to use it be the balance of payment that use to be fashionable economic argument back in the day when be teenager we use to have announcement on the news about the balance of payment month by month what have happen to that the balance of payment be every bit as important economically today as it be back in the we run current account deficit in this country of about billion that be huge number and it will be exacerbate if we choose and it would be political choice not to generate and export product from this economy to third economy but instead choose to import one exacerbate the balance of payment deficit twice over for those four reason be wholly in favour of the ambition behind this short bill climate change will be solve by reduce demand for hydrocarbon not by reduce supply we will solve the demand problem by provide cheap alternative which the government be do member who have contribute be quite right to highlight that we need renewable agree with the hon member point about reduce demand the great travesty be that we be still see house build today be sure he do in his constituency where the insulation be not at all deep that be ridiculous be it not could not agree more the future home building regulation which require significantly decrease carbon footprint for modern building come into force in it be deeply frustrating that they be not bring in early the soon they come in the well we also have the challenge of retrofitting insulation in the million exist house in britain some good point have be make by opposition members about the need to improve retrofitting and there be scope for the government to incentivise further insulation of private house to go with the successful scheme in place already for public sector building and housing we must also increase our wind power we have an extremely ambitious target of gw by the current rate be about gw of renewable wind power generation capacity we must also increase solar and nuclear include small modular reactor we need well technology for carbon capture usage and storage we need to accelerate our use of electric or hydrogen vehicle or frankly any other kind of technology that solve the problem and we need to incentivise the market to step into that area we need to take step back and look at building it be about not just about the operate carbon cost of exist infrastructure which we be focus on in both commercial building and the residential sector it be also about the embody carbon in our construction process hence my private member bill on the measurement of embody carbon in large building and development about of the carbon associate with building be in its construction not its operation there be area where the government be either ahead of the game or move in the right direction they have already be successful in reduce demand for hydrocarbon do not understand why labour appear to put virtue signal before the economic impact and local job support this eminently sensible bill in my four year as member of parliament keep come back to this question whose interest do this place serve do the law we pass and the structure we maintain serve the interest of our constituent be they design to enrich and empower they or do they deepen inequality in wealth and power serve the interest of the super rich and the company that dominate our economy say that because with this bill the question feel more relevant than ever the bill which scale up fossil fuel extraction in the north sea just as we should be rapidly scale it down be obviously not about help our constituent it be not about bring down energy bill even the secretary of state admit that and it be not about energy security former bp boss say that new north sea drilling be not go to make any difference to energy security that be no surprise since fossil fuel company be give ownership of what they extract and then sell it on the world market the bill be the very opposite of tackle the climate crisis that be blatant truth recognise by the government own climate change committee which say the bill be not in line with net zero if the bill be not about energy bill energy security or tackle the climate crisis what be it about the answer be simple it be about maximise profit for fossil fuel giant guarantee that they can extract every last bit of oil and gas no matter the consequence for people and planet these company be the last that need our support as energy bill soar last year our constituent know that reality far too well bp global profit hit billion shell report its high ever profit whopping billion this year the world five big oil company be expect to hand investor more than billion record bill for my coventry south constituent have mean record profit for fossil fuel giant eye water north sea oil and gas profit be not an accident but by design they be aid and abet by government choice the government north sea tax and subsidy regime be so skewed in the interest of fossil fuel company that for year shell and bp get away with pay zero tax on north sea production it be so rig in these company interest that the company develop the rosebank oil field will get billion tax break to develop the site mean our constituent will pay of the cost of develop it the public pay the cost the company cream off the profit and then we all face the consequence of its climate wreck activity and there be no doubt about that because the science be clear develop new oil and gas field be incompatible with our climate commitment more oil and gas extraction may be good for fossil fuel company and their shareholder but it spell disaster for the rest of we if we continue to let the climate crisis deteriorate we condemn our constituent to world where extreme weather pattern become more common and more severe where there be more storm henk and more storm ishas and where their wind blow hard and their flood get deep we condemn young people across the country to world where drought destroy crop and food system break down where sea level rise and million be displace that be the world that this climate wreck bill be help to create but there be an alternative it be call the green new deal it be programme of state lead investment in green industry rapidly replace fossil fuel with renewable create million of good unionise green job tax the rich and redistribute wealth and power in favour of ordinary people unlike the bill it be plan that put people and planet before profit there be no time to waste urge colleague to vote against this climate wreck bill and build that bright alternative suspect that for many member there be time when vote in this place can cause sleepless night or two for this vote have cause number of sleepless night there be dilemma on the one hand the responsibility to care for the life and livelihood of those people we represent today and on the other the responsibility to care for those who will come in the future and to leave the planet in well place for generation in time ahead on the one hand there be the risk to our energy security much great risk than any of we would have predict just couple of year ago due to the war in ukraine the situation in the middle east and in the red sea and who know what next the government be right on energy security that we can not move away from fossil fuel overnight we need to prioritise energy security for as long as we need fossil fuel import lng involve much great emission than use gas extract here rely on overseas energy mean job overseas not british job on the other hand there be the risk of climate change in my essex constituency the summer before last we see at first hand how real that risk be with really hot summer and rag fire recently across the uk so many people have witness awful flood we know that the warm the weather the wetter it will be couple of year ago see at first hand the true devastation when go to the eastern part of ethiopia region that few year ago be teem with wildlife they use to say you should never ask herder how many animal he have because you would never be able to stop count right now that land be totally devastate by consecutive year of drought million of people will no long be able to live in the land where they have live for generation the impact of that climate change will mean more people will be force to leave their country there will be more migration and that will impact we here at home unless there be action to tackle emission and climate change we will see those impact accelerate and worsen we also know that action to tackle climate change need to be global the government be right that the uk have do more than any other nation to reduce emission they be right that other country also need to play their part incidentally get really cross when people say to country like china and india be do nothing actually china be now invest in more renewable than any other country and more than the us and europe put together india be on track to deliver gw of renewable by which be absolutely massive country be move at just last month which attend country all over the world sign up to the pledge to transition away from fossil fuel we sign that pledge too the government will rightly point out that even with these new oil and gas licence the north sea will continue to be decline basin and that we be transition away from fossil fuel but the perception internationally be that by grant these licence the uk may be walk away from our promise on climate change when encourage other country to do the right thing leadership matter and the uk have key role to play we host the world in glasgow at if we the uk be see or perceive to be walk away from the promise we make to the world then other country might walk away from their promise too that be why it be vital that we be see to be keep the promise we make we must continue to cut energy waste and reduce our emission be very proud to be member of the energy security and net zero committee as one of only two member of the committee contribute to the debate will talk about some of the thing that have be do and that we must do more of million of home have become more energy efficient we should continue to do more especially in owner occupy home the priority have be social rent home which have be very successful but we must to do more to help owner occupy home we have unlock massive amount of renewable energy but we can unlock more it be really important that we get it connect to the grid more quickly the government be work on that would also like to see more local energy network so we can have local energy production nearer to where we have high energy risk and then we would not need quite so much extra grid transmission we need to accelerate new nuclear there have be some good announcement about that this month but especially in respect of the small modular reactor can we go fast we need to remove barrier to more innovation such as hydrogen especially for heat and we need to support the transition to more zero emission vehicle especially for those in terrace house say to the minister that we need to get rid of the pavement tax so that charge be affordable for all on all those matter the government have make great progress but we need to do more incidentally will take no lesson from labour members on this because in their year of power they do so little to cut emission the government be right to say that the transition to net zero need to be affordable practical and pragmatic but it should also involve be honest with people it be estimate that even the new gas licence will provide only day worth of of today demand between now and so let we have an honest discussion about the fact that this bill will not do everything however it be important for energy security that we continue to look at how we can well meet our local energy need on offshore oil and gas have first hand experience of how important be respected world leader on environment issue can be in persuade other country to change their behaviour member will recall that year ago the world watch in horror when the deepwater horizon explosion cause an environmental catastrophe in the gulf of mexico at the time the european union have knee jerk reaction and produce draft legislation that would have ban all deep water drilling as member of the european parliament committee on industry research and energy at the time be appoint by mep to lead the work of the european parliament in scrutinise that directive meet offshore safety expert environmentalist geologist and regulator and it become clear to that the european commission proposal be not the right way forward time and again be tell that not all deep water drilling be dangerous and not all shallow water drilling be safe remember table more than amendment to the european commission text change it paragraph by paragraph so that instead of ban all deep water drilling the commission would take site specific approach look at the risk of every single proposal persuade the british labour members of the european parliament that that be the right thing to do and persuade the british liberal democrat mep that it be the right thing to do persuade parliamentarian from country that it be the right thing to do they agree because they know that the uk be the world leader when it come to the environmental and safety standard of the offshore oil and gas industry will my right hon friend give way be go to carry on my point be that maintain our leadership in environmental standard in the north sea be key to persuade other country to think about their energy in the future the government say that they want this country to continue to be world leader but at this point we have lose bit of leadership to norway where gas be produce in way that be less carbon intensive than the way in which gas be produce in our north sea measure such as ban flare electrify the production process with the use of float wind and work with neighbouring country to see how our carbon capture capacity can be use to decarbonise the refining process could make huge difference to the carbon emission that be cause and use when we be produce oil and gas in our north sea as we make the transition away from fossil fuel should like to see the world move towards consider how we can make that industry as low carbon as possible some of my colleague have talk about amendment relate to some of these issue and hope the minister and the government will be open to any such amendment think that as currently word the bill do not really let the government do anything that they can not do already they can already grant these licence but it do give we an opportunity to show that this country have the ambition to ensure that any carbon emission that come from fossil fuel during this transition be as low as possible and that our industry be as clean as possible that would help the uk to maintain its world lead voice in environmental negotiation and encourage other country to clean up and decarbonise their production thus help to ensure that the global transition away from fossil fuel take place in as clean way as possible believe that we should be able to do all that while also address those other priority such as deliver and improve our energy security and deliver and improve job security here at home the propose legislation before we be an outrage and be pleased that we have have the opportunity today to discuss in detail what it mean it have be relatively good natured debate but it have show very clearly where the political choice be and find the political choice of the conservatives unacceptable new licence for new oil and gas field in the north sea be in direct conflict with our national and international net zero commitment we must get away from our dependence on fossil fuel not extend it at the government sign an international agreement to phase out fossil fuel but we be do the opposite in this country it be just not acceptable for we to do one thing abroad and another at home as have already be say so many time this afternoon this be lose we our reputation for good leadership and lose any credibility that the government could have at home or abroad the government claim that the bill ensure our energy security be complete fiction recent analysis from the energy and climate intelligence unit find that oil from new licence send to uk refinery would account for less than of fuel use in the uk in the bill would make little or no difference to uk energy security and the secretary of state herself admit that it would do little to cut bill furthermore on the basis of past record new licence issue since have produce only day of extra gas supply between now and new licence be expect to provide an average of only four day of gas per annum be it really worth it to lose our reputation our commitment and our path to net zero for that the vast majority of this new oil and gas production would not stay in the uk it would be sell on global market for consumption abroad no government should want repeat of the energy crisis of last year which be bring on by the crisis in global fossil fuel supply and soar price on the global oil and gas market only by move away from fossil fuel can it be guarantee that such crisis will not be repeat however this legislation be not just stupid and unnecessary but dangerous it break down decade long cross party consensus that every government must be seriously commit to cut greenhouse gas emission and must provide strong unflinche leadership to help people organisation and business along the road to successful energy transition as we have hear today there be fair amount of consensus so why should it be break that be really not understandable undermine this consensus be hugely irresponsible and send entirely the wrong signal to the international community the late negotiation have show how rocky the path to net zero be and how important the leadership of the develop nation remain be at and it be really sad to see how that leadership have be lose and how many nation look at we and shake their head they can not understand what have happen to the uk in the last year or two it be not just at the climate cop that there be an issue be at montreal at the nature cop and we be in the vanguard of agree that of water should be protect for nature these additional drilling rig cause havoc in our inland water but of new licence be declare in marine protect area so we be see nature crisis be cause by this as well as climate crisis yes indeed many organisation that campaign to protect nature and the ocean have write to and probably to many other member of parliament about how extremely dangerous and damaging this be to marine wildlife the uk be in strong position geographically to cover its future energy need from renewable and from cut energy consumption the minister well know my position on this diverse home grow renewable energy and significant home insulation programme be key to the solution the energy efficiency of our home be among the bad in europe and yes if we be talk about job we be lack so many of the job that we need in the retrofitting and upgrade sector we need new workforce in the new technology for the net zero future of our uk economy that be not look back at past fuel they have power the world yes but we need to transition and we can not keep on with business as usual that be the problem and the opportunity it be deplorable that the government have finish embrace this new future and break the consensus that we have across the house where be the legislation to address all that fail project after fail project alongside acute underfunding mean that people continue to live in cold home with sky high energy bill so where be the legislation to revolutionise our home retrofitting agenda the problem need long term policy and funding commitment rather than the stop and start of this government while offshore wind be no doubt success story we must move fast onshore wind development have be slow and solar have be particularly off track in fact we be go backwards the proportion of renewable project that be be delay be on the rise last year the government predictable failure to contract new offshore wind lose gw of renewable energy and the opportunity to save consumer billion year renewable developer still face planning system that be stack against onshore wind and community energy provider still face enormous start up cost rather than petroleum bill why be we not debate marine energy bill today to incentivise investment in the various new technology in marine energy and facilitate the fast roll out of installation the government be waste time and money on the fuel of the past instead they should champion uk technology and innovation so why this bill my suspicion be that it be an election year bill to drive division and fuel the culture war for too long work people have be make to worry that the green energy transition be punishment for they and that it will cost they prosperity livelihood and the way of life that they be use to but there be country who have successfully turn the negative narrative into prospect of hope and major opportunity the us inflation reduction act and the eu green industrial plan will together see over billion of green investment create new and exciting job and career even canada an economy small than our have announce package that offer nearly billion worth of tax credit for green technology green investment will be worth potential trillion by uncertainty over this government commitment to reach net zero mean that investor be look the other way oil and gas be energy source of the past put our political future towards they only amplifie how seriously out of touch and out of idea this current government be the bill be misleading and counterproductive it fly in the face of our net zero commitment and will do nothing to ensure our energy security indeed it will do the opposite we liberal democrats will support the labour reason amendment and oppose this government bill and call on all colleague across the house with an ounce of honesty and integrity to do the same the irony be not lose on in this debate that every single one of we in this place want the same thing normally when the whole house agree on something think that something be wrong but in this case have no doubt that the whole house be right we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel what we be debate today and argue about in this place be how we can get there in the most pragmatic way this bill be another example of the government try their good to do what be right at this moment in time but fear that the punitive taxis will ask the minister more about those in minute will not help the investment that the government say be so need to rely more on our own gas and oil from the north sea be necessity and full of common sense it be fact that we will be rely on fossil fuel for decade to come point that no one in this place deny the uk have make some impressive advance in wind and solar and new generation of nuclear be on its way although have to say that we and the opposition have be talk about nuclear investment for year yet so little have be do wind and solar be excellent way of generate power have not yet hear anyone here today say that when the wind do not blow and the sun do not will come to tidal in minute if may the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas have just join the debate think but will answer her point portland in my constituency have huge tidal race but it be fact that when the sun do not shine and the wind do not blow we do not get the energy we need also as we have hear many time we have cut our emission by half we be world leader and have record to be very proud of just touch on what the hon lady say about tidal yes of course we have huge tidal race in this country include in scotland and in portland off the coast of south dorset in my constituency if we can explore this and harness it to make it work there be major technical issue not least with sand and with salt water which be very destructive then she be absolutely right it be way of generate energy that be sure everyone would support have hear from several speaker today about the instability of the world we live in that be very true and do not have to rehearse why feel that in my lifetime we be face the most dangerous time on our planet if we do not have the power to drive our economy and our home it would be strategically quite apart from anything else insane we be an island nation and do not have to remind anyone in this house how significant energy independence be go to be in the event of catastrophe here we have bill that will allow company to apply for licence to safeguard domestic energy supply the bill say that this will safeguard more than job enhance our security reduce dependence on high emission import from overseas and significantly prevent family and business from be unduly burden which to certain degree they already be through the green taxis that everyone face so what not to like you may ask be very convinced by the argument that my hon friend be put forward but he have miss one useful point do he not agree that the generation of oil and gas in the north sea will generate tax receipt that can then be use to subsidise green energy production in other part of the british economy that point have be raise several time and totally agree that the tax receipt from investment in oil and gas play huge part in our economy might have this wrong but as understand it these company will face corporation tax and windfall levy would be grateful if in his sum up the minister could say whether that be true be not an expert in the industry but think that chief executive board member and shareholder would wince if have be tell that they have to do all this they have to pay all that punitive taxation they might say why on earth should we do this in the first place not to step on the minister toe but my understanding be that even before the energy profit levy the oil and gas sector be at already the most tax sector in the plus be stand to be correct by the minister if be wrong hope my hon friend and can be correct by the minister because as the house have just hear the tax rate be punitive if we be go to do this for all the common sense reason that the minister and the government say we should why on earth be we raise taxis to such point that it discourage and disincentivise all those who need to spend hundred of million of pound or more to get the oil and gas out of the ground the powerful climate change committee which operate outside this place be mention occasionally but frankly it be pretty unaccountable it be very influential and it have now set our fourth carbon budget which can be legally challenge once it be in place wonder whether the government fear that they could find themselves in the court as they rightfully plough on with this bill to which many people object it shock to the core that it have take war in europe for the west to prioritise both energy and food security for how many decade have we be talk about nuclear power and what have happen very little nuclear will be vital component of keep the light on and keep this country safe globalisation have soften our resolve to stand alone if need be when hard time hit in whatever shape they come the bill have lot go for it not least most welcome return to our old and absent friend common sense urge the government to find pragmatic solution to the transition to net zero and allow the private sector to do what it do well which be provide job and prosperity not least in scotland the search for alternative to fossil fuel will continue and as we have hear the tax receipt will be use to invest in green energy have no doubt at all that an affordable reliable and plentiful solution will be find the human race have remarkable ability to survive but in the meantime will the government continue to work in the real world to keep the light on the economy run and the country strategically safe it be pleasure to follow the hon member for south dorset richard drax the irony will not be lose on you of all people mr deputy speaker that we be reduce in number in parliament today by the impact of storm isha the origin of which lie in climate change yet we be debate the government desire to increase the global supply of oil and gas it be also damn that the government net zero tsar chris skidmore feel compel to resign have spend three month research his report and travel the length and breadth of these isle he say that he could no long condone nor continue to support government that be commit to course of action that know will cause future harm to pick up the point make by the hon member for south dorset year ago when be councillor be talk about how we need to create energy resilience in warwickshire how we need to consider the future need of our community and how we could well use our pension fund to help to drive that agenda the government claim that the bill will not add undue burden on household undue burden be pretty strange phrase the secretary of state have also admit that new licence will not necessarily bring down energy bill let put that into context this be the same conservative government who rip up the zero carbon home policy announce by chancellor gordon brown in and produce by my right hon friend the member for leeds central hilary benn and my hon friend the member for llanelli dame nia griffith that legislation would have mean that all new home build from onwards be zero carbon just imagine we would have build million zero carbon home by now there would be thousand of new zero carbon home in my warwick and leamington constituency on the mallory grange priors montague point myton gardens chesterton gardens and victoria point estate and many other my constituent would be benefit from next to no energy bill and they would be do the right thing but they be deny that choice by the conservative government who rip up that legislation the next generation will not thank this government for what they have do they will not be thankful for one of the high level of debt we have ever see the great tax burden since the war the stagnant economy and dare say the moral bankruptcy of this government we have have nine name storm so far this year with the come down the track we have just name storm in the flooding be reach into all corner of the united kingdom create economic damage damage to people home and business and distress to all there have be damage to infrastructure crop and food production waterlogge soil mean that seed and crop can not be harvest report from ernst young say that last year be the bad year for insurance underwriting in decade push up premium by at least one third in the next two year an expect increase of amanda blanc the chief executive of aviva have say that new oil and gas drilling put at clear risk the job growth and the additional investment the uk require to become more climate ready today the country be plunge far into chaos and economic damage our transport be disrupt and our business be impact colleague have be unable to get to london to attend parliament two week ago request debate on flood and flooding and on my journey home my train be delay by landslip cause by climate change yet more irony we need wide debate on the impact of climate change which be cause not just flood but tidal surge and strong wind the prime minister speak of climate zealot well the public and young people especially must be climate zealot because be afraid they be deeply concerned they be not zealot they be realist about the future we face on my recent visit nearly every primary school st margaret all saints st paul heathcote woodloes st peter coten end and bishop tachbrook could name they all have raise the critical importance of climate change and how they want we in this place to bring about immediate action the young people study in our college understand the future they can see what be happen and they have say to the future be electric that why we be train for these skill they get it they can see the future we know that be the world hot on record last year be about warm than the long term average before human start burn large amount of fossil fuel the eight warm year on record have occur since the global average sea level have rise by to inch flood across the uk include in my constituency have damage property across the country and million property be at risk of flooding in england in those fact underline just how irresponsible this bill be we be year on from the stern report and an inconvenient truth which be tell like never before by vice president al gore two year ago the report by the uk independent climate change committee say that the good way to ease consumer pain from high energy price be to stop use fossil fuel rather than drill for more of they that be part of the great deception that be this legislation the good way to bring down price be to reduce demand and the government be do next to nothing on that we also need to bring in cheap energy source and to reduce demand by insulate home we can put in energy insulation panel that be really not very thick the approach be take in this legislation be crime and an obscenity and it be happen because the government tear up the legislation of the last labour government we need to bring in cheap energy source by allow onshore wind which be currently the cheap form of electricity generation in the month to the end of september total consumer expenditure on electricity gas and other fuel use in the home be billion figure almost double that of two year before as my right hon friend the member for doncaster north edward miliband say it be precisely our dependence on fossil fuel that have lead to the bad cost of live crisis in generation it be clear from the king speech that this bill will not take even penny off energy bill lord browne of all people the former chief executive of bp he be also highly regard individual across the industry and in the other place where he be cross bench peer say that the proposal be not go to make any difference to the uk energy security that point be echo by the former prime minister the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may in conclusion energy security have to start at home but not the home of the international oil and gas major and their market preference and instead the home of the british people home that be well insulate and that can generate and store their own electricity and power the only thing hold back the british people be this government who be weak and capable only of short term decision that be why the country need labour clean power mission to make the uk clean energy superpower we have plan to make energy cheap and secure so that the british public never again face spiral bill it be plan to boost job and investment in every region and nation of the country it be plan to cut energy bill for good take up to off annual household bill to create good job by rebuild the strength of our industrial heartland and coastal community create more than million job in year and to deliver energy security by use our abundant natural resource for our own citizen we will do that by establish gb energy new home grow publicly own champion in clean energy generation to build job and supply chain here at home we will also set up the national wealth fund which will create good well pay job by invest alongside the private sector in gigafactorie clean steel plant renewable ready port green hydrogen and energy storage we will also do this through warm home plan the bill be yet another reason why this country be desperate for general election and will be vote against it welcome the fact that the government have introduce this bill even though it may well be belated acceptance that some policy they have be follow in pursuit of net zero have to be revise we know that because of the energy security issue and the dramatic rise in the cost of energy in response to the fall in supply result from the war in ukraine and the sanction impose in russia as well as the impact on the supply chain after covid the supply of energy especially oil and gas to an economy that still depend heavily on those kind of source be very important let we not pretend that we be on the verge of not have to use oil and gas any long because of our energy come from oil and gas and come from renewable even those who want we to rush headlong towards net zero such as those in the climate change committee accept that we be still go to have to use fossil fuel well into the next decade and for decade after therefore it be important that we examine how we generate those resource the bill be also an acceptance by the government or there should now be an acceptance that as we have pursue the net zero agenda we have be put people job at risk we have see that just in the past week with job go in south wales most of the energy intensive industry in this country have be decimate we proudly beat our chest and say we have reduce our carbon emission but if we be honest with ourselves we will see that all we have do be steal job from this country and move production for vital material overseas to place where environmental and work standard and standard on pollution be far low than our in this country so welcome the fact that the government be belatedly look again at some of the policy they be pursue do not know whether the bill will increase the number of licence application that be make it may well be that since the process be already there it will be as easy as it have be in the past for company to make an application but at least this signal to company that have reduce their investment in these vital industry that they can at least with this policy have some more confidence when they make investment decision however doubt very much give the labour party attitude and the fact that we be in general election year that that confidence will be engender as much as the government hope it will be do not want to go through all of the argument that have be make include on the balance of payment as result of the natural decline in the north sea and the fact that we have also discourage investment between and we have double the value of energy import per household into the uk from per household in to per household in we can not ignore the impact that that have on the balance of payment or security of supply because those import be come from country that be sometimes less stable than we need they to be for energy which be such vital resource the labour amendment state that this policy will ensure the uk remain at the mercy of petrostate and dictator who control fossil fuel market where be the logic in that for example if we do not get it from the north sea we will get it from saudi arabia russia venezuela and many other country that use oil as political weapon and that be not always well disposed towards we by diminish our dependence on the oil and gas we can extract from our own territory we put ourselves at the mercy of those who politicise one of our energy resource we have to be cognisant of that the second reason be that we have job in the sector across the united kingdom include strangely enough job in scotland which the snp appear to be quite happy to sacrifice we have sacrifice job in many energy intensive industry already be we now go to sacrifice these often well pay job and say that there will be just transition many time in this house have hear the argument that oh all these people who be employ in the oil and gas industry will go into renewable well let we look that the government tell we that we have have huge increase in renewable production have it result in job for worker in the united kingdom hon member yes no of course it have not where be the windmill make where be the steel for the windmill make not in port talbot and the steel that be still make there will not be make there for very much long boat bring it half way around the world from country that make it cheaply because they use the cheap form of energy the idea that we would suddenly have all these people employ in the manufacture installation and maintenance of solar panel and windmill ev battery factory all over the place and graduate employ in finance and everything else for the offshore industry have not happen the just transition be not go to occur why would we transition when there be still resource to be exploit by the people who have the skill to do that and for the benefit of the country the third argument wish to make in favour of the bill be its necessity some of our domestic heating be currently provide by gas with from oil some of our travel be drive by fossil fuel and some of our electricity be generate from fossil fuel that will continue into the future quite frankly doubt whether the argument we have hear about we have to be global leader in get to net zero ring true with ordinary people who want to heat their house efficiently cheaply and securely drive their car get on bus train and aeroplane or however they decide to travel or ensure that electricity can be supply we might fool ourselves that we be global leader but the truth be that we produce of global emission other country that quite rightly want to industrialise do not heed we they be go for the cheap form of energy available to they in some country in africa for example of people be not even connect to an electricity grid and they do not have the benefit we have such as turn on light at night or have fridge to keep their food fresh and stop it from deteriorate in the heat it be bit arrogant of people in the house to say and by the way you might have plenty of coal and oil but we do want you to use it we do want you to have the benefit of the cheap energy that give we our prosperity cheap energy be the ground of economic growth can understand why people do not follow our lead and do their own thing the idea that because we pass the bill the whole world will say oh this be terrible britain be no long commit to net zero and we be now go to do our own thing they be do their own thing anyway the question many people in the united kingdom have be what their government be do to maintain their standard of living the idea of global leadership be not at the forefront of their thinking have some reservation about the bill the first as the hon member for south dorset richard drax say be the question of whether the bill be design to engender confidence many company look at whether they should put money into apply for license and explore for oil will wonder whether they will find their way block even with the legislation they will be ask themselves whether their economic opportunity will be block by judicial review and by people who simply say the uk target for global emission be go to be meet in part by reduce oil production in our own country and as result of the bill and grant license the target will be miss and we will judicially review it doubt very much that the bill will engender the confidence the minister be hop it will if there be likely to be judicial review or if there be path open and the basis upon which to make judicial review secondly as hon member have argue if we be go to exploit the oil we have and benefit from it then it be well to keep it in our own country and ensure that it be use in our own country some of the gas we extract be use in the uk because we have the network for it to feed into so it can be use and sell in the uk the hon member for east lothian kenny macaskill raise the issue of grangemouth which be not the only example of the fact that we do not invest in facility for refine oil in the united kingdom why not because oil refining be an oil intensive industry so give all the carbon taxis and the barrier put in the way of carbon intensive industry no investment be take place or have take place for decade so what do we do we extract it and send it elsewhere we bring it back most often but would it not be of benefit to ensure that it stay in the united kingdom because we have the facility for process it here my final reservation be that when those who might form the next government of the united kingdom be determined to undo all this legislation how will that engender confidence know that be probably in minority when it come to the debate but there be debate to be have with the ideologue who be drive policy that most people in this house can well afford people may say that the cost of energy will not go up as result of renewable but just this week the chief executive of siemens the big producer of electricity from wind in the united kingdom say that high bill be inevitable as we grapple with the huge cost of generate wind power because of inflation and the cost of maintenance fault and breakdown he say every transformation come at cost and every transformation be painful and that something which the energy industry and the public sector government do not really want to hear unfortunately that be the battle that we face there be those in this house who be wed to an ideology and will drive it through regardless of the impact that it have on our constituent how many crocodile tear have be cry by member in this house when they see people lose their job in energy intensive industry and then in the next breath say that the government be not go hard enough to reach net zero there be divide between those who be drive by this ideology and the ordinary people in the country who live with the consequence of it if this bill be at least start in try to redress that imbalance then welcome it just last month make history by acknowledge for the first time the need to transition away from fossil fuel it should not have take cop to accept what scientist have know for decade despite all the vested interest at play the effort of hundred of lobbyist and the huge sum pour into prevent climate action the truth become impossible to ignore the effect of climate chaos be now in plain sight of the hot year on record as mention previously in this debate all happen in the past decade and the speed of change be only increase to avert catastrophe we must work now towards fossil free future why do our government insist on keep we in the past and try to build our recovery on resource that the world have formally commit to move away from the government claim that it be about lower household bill but even the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have admit that it will not do that the energy generate from new oil and gas would not belong to the british people power our home for cheap it would be in the hand of private company and sell on the global market for internationally set price it would be own by those same energy company that have already make record break profit in the cost of living crisis while million household sit in the cold last winter too scared to turn on the heating madam deputy speaker those corporation do not need any more state handout if the government really care about energy bill they would be fund mass programme of insulate home which the tories slash support for in if they care about secure our future they would be focus on invest in publicly own home grow renewable which have never be cheap they would be deliver green new deal to protect our living standard and our planet for decade to come therefore if not to lower our bill now to ensure energy security in the future and to enable green transition why be the government push through this dangerous and unpopular bill be it just to annoy environmentalist and turn climate policy into wedge issue or could it have anything to do with the fact that the conservatives have take million in year from big polluter climate denier and fossil fuel interest madam deputy speaker when justify this act of climate vandalism the government like to reference the climate change committee unfortunately though they have misrepresent the advice of that committee to the point that its chair piers forster have be force to speak out in response to the government false claim he say uk oil and gas consumption need to fall by over to meet uk target this and the cop decision make further licensing inconsistent with climate goal it be not only embarrassing but deeply concern that on an issue as important as the future of our planet the government be either unable or unwilling to understand expert advice it be not just the climate change committee that have warn against new fossil fuel so too have the un secretary general interruption conservative members would do well to listen to this he call on all nation to cease all licensing or funding of new oil and gas in addition the international institute for sustainable development have say that no new oil and gas development be possible if the world be to stay within the paris agreement temperature limit the director of the international energy agency say if government be serious about the climate crisis there can be no new investment in oil gas and coal moreover more than scientist write to the prime minister last year ask he to halt the licensing should we be take advice from hundred of lead climate expert or from lobbyist for fossil fuel industry the bill in front of we will not solve any of our problem it will just contribute to wreck the planet and undermine our climate creditability on the international stage for the sake of our future and our planet urge the house to vote down this dangerous bill it be pleasure to follow the hon member for nottingham east nadia whittome it be slightly less of pleasure to listen to the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson want to say few word about the case that he make it reach new depth to suggest that the poor people in the country will somehow be well off if we continue exploit more oil and gas when clearly new and exist oil and gas be so expensive he cite comment by siemens about the expensiveness of renewable but that be precisely because they be link to the price of gas that be why we need to reform the totally out of date electricity and gas system that we have in this country it tell we all we need to know about this cynical and fail government that the legislation they choose to debate first in be bill to mandate the annual licensing of oil and gas product in the north sea not legislation that rise to the immediate challenge that we face as society from the cost of live scandal which see family unable to meet their basic need to the planetary emergency rapidly unfold before our eye but instead bill that be frankly no more than political stunt at home yet at the same time very dangerous signal to other country abroad of uk double down on the fossil fuel economy the reality as many have say be that the bill be entirely redundant with even the north sea transition authority express its unanimous view that it be not need as the minister know perfectly well there have be annual licensing round for most of the past decade drive by the frankly obscene duty to maximise the economic recovery of uk petroleum despite the hundred of licence that have be issue in that time paltry day worth of gas have be produce as other have say it have be estimate that between now and new licence would provide the equivalent of just four day worth of gas each year so it be hardly the energy security that we have be promise and that we have hear so much about from the conservative benches over the past three or four hour of course any oil and gas which be extract will be own by company and sell on the international market to the high bidder unless the government unbeknown to we have in mind the renationalisation of energy which would be very interesting conversation to have but when last check that be not their policy this oil and gas in the north sea do not belong to the government and it will not bring down bill let we not forget either that of uk oil be currently export as be the equivalent of more than of gross gas production last year be grateful to the hon member for give way one such example be gazprom international uk which continue to produce gas from the north sea last year this subsidiary company pay million dividend in june do she not think it hypocritical of this conservative government to talk about this bill in term of national security while simultaneously allow russian energy giant to extract gas from the north sea and pay taxis in moscow thank the hon member for his point and it be incredibly well make shall say little more on that subject very shortly essentially this bill be nothing more than reckless political theatre it be nothing more than cynical attempt to stoke yet more division and weaponise much need climate action in some misguided sense that somehow this will save the prime minister skin while the bill serve at home to highlight the impotence of the government sadly its international impact be far reach despite the prime minister fairly evidence free claim at that the uk be lead by example the reality be that create climate culture war scrap vital policy and issue new fossil fuel licence be the very opposite of climate leadership the bill send dangerous signal and undermine global effort to address the climate emergency by hamper diplomacy and legitimise extraction in other country as lord deben former chair of the climate change committee say how can we ask other nation not to expand the fossil fuel production if we start do it ourselves it be frankly scandal that the uk be among just five country in the global north that be responsible for more than half the plan expansion of new oil and gas field up to while minister like to claim that even with continued licensing production from the uk continental shelf be project to decline at annually what matter be not whether we be produce less relative to some previous time but whether the oil and gas that we be produce now be compatible with our climate goal clearly it be not with the un production gap report warn that government already plan to produce far more than double the amount of fossil fuel in than would be consistent with limit heating to the government defence of the bill and of the continued licensing of more oil and gas in the north sea as whole imply that somehow the uk operate in vacuum and domestic decision have no bearing on our ability to meet our international climate target that clearly be not the case it be no surprise then that professor piers forster the interim chair of the climate change committee have say uk oil and gas consumption need to fall by over to meet uk target this and cop decision make further licensing inconsistent with climate goal when talk about inconsistency with our climate goal we could also talk about hypocrisy since climate emergency be declare in this very chamber in no few than new field have be approve laverda barnacle cadet sillimanite blythe elgood southwark evelyn abigail jackdaw tommeliten talbot teal west murlach alwyn east rosebank and most recently victory mention rosebank give an opportunity to come back to an issue that have be touch on few time tonight the scale of fossil fuel subsidy we have hear load of guff from conservative members about the importance of tax revenue from oil and gas yet look at the amount of money we be give to the oil and gas industry the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord speak about tax revenue go to russia we could also point out that the uk taxpayer will hand over no less than the equivalent of billion to equinor to develop the rosebank site because of the massive loophole in the windfall tax that mean that for every invest can be claim back bit of clarity on these issue would help section of the environment act require that statement be make on the front of the bill say whether it be in line with other environmental law the secretary of state claim in her statement that the bill will not have the effect of reduce the level of environmental protection provide for by any exist environmental law to that seem extraordinary because even if one believe that the carbon intensity test would make difference the annual licensing round under the bill could easily cancel out any predict carbon saving and lead to an overall increase in emission hope that she will tell we what modelling be undertake to inform her section statement look at its content more closely the bill propose two so call test which be set so ludicrously low they be impossible to fail the first be the carbon intensity test which be meet if the carbon intensity of domestically produce gas be low than that of import liquefy natural gas that test not only ignore the fact that more than half our gas import come from norway via pipeline as we have establish where gas production be half as pollute as in the uk but in only consider gas it fail to take account of the fact that of remain north sea oil reserve be oil in any case compare the carbon intensity at the point of production rather than combustion exaggerate the difference between different source give that the vast majority of emission be produce when any oil or gas be burn in other word they be scope emission which remain unaccounted for the second test be the net importer test which will be meet if the amount of oil and gas produce in the uk be less than the uk demand for oil and gas surely that question would be much well address by reduce demand rather than produce more planet heat oil and gas yet the government seem incapable of pursue demand reduction in any meaningful way what should the government do instead if they be actually interested in cut household bill and deliver energy security they would be work to get we off expensive gas for good rather than continue to tether we to volatile international market the national infrastructure commission have be really clear reliance on fossil fuel mean exposure to geopolitical shock that impact the price of these internationally trade commodity in its energy outlook report the iea report that high share of renewable correlate with low electricity price in response to the energy crisis with energy efficiency and heat electrification provide an important buffer for household at time when as we have hear million family in the uk be live in fuel poverty this winter we have to ask why the government be double down on the very thing at the heart of the crisis the government should instead be deliver meaningful just transition that genuinely meet the need of worker and community rather than temporarily prop up insecure job that we know will not exist in year to come we have hear the rhetoric from conservative members pretend that those of we who want to accelerate transition to green economy do not have people job in mind that be totally untrue it be precisely because we care about people job that we want they to have sustainable job into the future good quality decent job and be not pretend that drain resource in the north sea will somehow provide sustainable livelihood in year to come there should be massive scaling up of renewable and we should back cheap and abundant energy source such as onshore wind for which grand total of zero application have be submit since planning rule be change in september there should be nationwide street by street energy efficiency programme to ensure that family have warm home for the long term rather than scrap the upgrade in standard of private rent home which accord to the climate change committee could have save tenant year even at so call normal price let alone at time when price be spiral again what an indictment of the government remember the green deal back in the government set the interest rate so ridiculously high as we all say at the time that unsurprisingly the whole plan collapse those home be not insulate and plenty of energy company include in my constituency go bust as result the government be incompetent as well as totally ideologically drive the government should be properly tax the filthy profit of oil and gas company rather than foist the cost of new development on to the taxpayer and they should urgently withdraw from the dangerous energy charter treaty which it beggar belief allow we to be sue by fossil fuel company fair and green energy system be entirely possible but it require both imagination and investment two quality that do not associate with the government the legislation make it painfully clear that the government be wilfully ignore the lesson of both the climate and the energy crisis and be once again privilege their own interest above the wellbeing of people and planet the bill send exactly the wrong signal at the wrong time and actively undermine global effort to address the climate emergency by hamper diplomacy and give the green light to further extraction right around the world it be not what leadership look like it be not what this moment demand and all our constituent deserve well it be pleasure to follow the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas while we do not always agree on everything there be many thing that we do agree on too would like to see the mass scale up of renewable but also want to be pragmatic about where we be some of thing that we need to do and what the bill do the issue of energy be one that impact every person in the uk from the one bed flat owner to the bed hotel owner the ability to secure safe and reliable energy be essential and spiral cost be have an effect on the day to day life of people throughout the uk think it be important that make this point and perhaps explain where be personally on the matter grow up and other in the house be probably the same in an age of throw another jumper on my child use to laugh at the story tell they of how cold it have to be before the heating be turn on for we today it be no long laugh matter for many people my researcher who own modest home have to put more than of gas into her home in december she be at home during term time with the child she tell that the gas be not even run constantly it be turn off whenever she go to visit her parent or her husband parent or go out think of how much more wee use that word often in the house as descriptor widow pensioner would be pay in their home when they be there almost all day every day that figure be not one that their pension and single winter fuel payment could cover there be only so many jumper that someone can put on and jumper do not help with damp wall it be clear that the cost of energy dictate what step we take to secure the current energy supply while also stride for new alternative renewable energy source as many in this place will have hear say on numerous occasion tidal energy in strangford lough and other such area need great deal of funding the pilot scheme work but it be at the wrong time because the cost of the energy that it produce be not financially feasible but it would be now if we can harness that power which be as reliable as the sun rise in the morning we be on to winner however understand that that be not the point of today debate and will leave it at that the secretary of state for energy security and net zero be in her place and know the government have take giant step to meet the net zero target and have commit themselves to green energy wish to put on the record that be committed to the same target as well but we need to strike balance the balance that put forward to the house and wish to make declaration be from my point of view as farmer we own land my neighbour be all dairy man or farmer of beef cattle and sheep they be willing to commit themselves to the net zero target because they see that net zero be something that must be do as part of that target they must reduce the number of their animal that be not possible to do while continue to have feasible and financially viable farm there be other thing that the farmer wish to do in the countryside where live there be not enough electric vehicle point so people do not buy an electric or hybrid car probably because all the ev point be up in newtownards drive diesel vehicle have do all my day and if be spar will probably continue to do so because believe that it be choice it be choice we may not wish to make every time but be one that we have to make because electric car be just not feasible because the ev point be just not there do the hon gentleman agree that the national farmers union have be positive on many of these issue do he agree with what it say about hydrogen be source of sustainable power in the future and that it be come soon thank my hon friend call he that because have great respect for he and agree wholeheartedly with what he have just say the farming community the nfu and the ulster farmers union be clearly commit to the target they be commit to look at the alternative but the alternative have to be practical the point be try to make be that it be about where thing be practical there be no doubt that to meet not just our net zero target but more importantly our environmental obligation we need to do well job of access and use renewable energy fuel however the fact be we will simply not be there any time soon and in the meantime it be vital that we secure safety and security for our constituent support the aim of the bill which would enhance the procedure currently in place and note that no financial hardship should be pass on through the bill that be vital as know that household be struggle with the current pressure no long be it matter simply for household in poverty work family with decent wage be be affect it be transition it be about meet our net zero target and increase green energy and renewable which my hon friend the member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas refer to at the same time the bill give we the opportunity to progress those renewable in way that be positive in the short term the library briefing make it clear that license round be run when the nsta decide they be necessary however it should be highlight that they have be hold broadly on an annual basis up to the licensing round which open in the licensing round be launch in october follow the introduction of climate compatibility checkpoint in september in october new licence be award as part of that licensing round that be not onerous but it be necessary not just to safeguard our industry by enhance investor and industry confidence as the government have highlight but to ensure that we do not see family scrap penny together to afford heat my contribution to the debate be clearly for those who be in energy difficulty today the paper refer to food bank referral be up some the food bank in my constituency of strangford in my major town of newtownards see increase in referral over december and early january from people who be middle class who be find it difficult to deal with energy price know of several young family who usually enjoy few day away when the kid be off at christmas and they tell that they be just not able to do it this year people may say for goodness sake they can go on holiday be not say that because it be their right to have that break but be highlight the knock on effect for family of increase price be that they can not afford to sow into the local economy in the way they use to that mean the little bed hotel they usually visit do not get their business the knock on effect be that they do not hire the clean for as many hour her income drop and she can not spend the way she usually do so the knock on effect continue we need the people who spend locally to do so and for they to do that energy bill need to be manageable we be fail when it come to energy provision if the bill help safeguard our provision as we continue to find well way to source reliable renewable energy support that when the minister or secretary of state sum up if they could give we that reassurance would be whole lot happy about this debate of course we need to explore tidal energy but safeguard domestic production can go hand in hand with that indeed it must do so be committed to renewable green energy possibility and net zero target because the farming community that live in want to commit themselves to that as well support our family our vulnerable ill and elderly and those live in cold damp home because they can not afford to do otherwise therefore at this stage support the bill on behalf of all those struggle to heat their home and keep their family warm we must commit ourselves to more renewable and ensure that the renewable percentage rise if it rise we can reduce gas and petroleum usage by do so we can balance the process that be what be hop for from the minister reply hope we can deliver that before call the shadow minister want to emphasise again and will do so when he have finish how important it be for those who have contribute to the debate to be here for the wind up call the shadow minister we have have an excellent and pointed debate this evening certainly opposition members have together point out the deficiency in the bill point out what specious and potentially damaging bill it be and indeed question why the bill be bring to the house in the first place all that be what very much want to do my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion call this bill illogical and damaging and point out that it could put marine protect area at risk my hon friend the member for llanelli dame nia griffith point out that it make we look ridiculous on the world stage my hon friend the member for brent north barry gardiner point out that the bill itself be base on series of lie and indeed quote the un secretary general state that the truly dangerous radical be the country that be increase their oil and gas output my hon friend the member for coventry south zarah sultana point out strongly that this bill contrary to its claim be not about energy security my hon friend the member for warwick and leamington matt western who remind we of the real effect of climate change right now point out that the future be largely electric and this bill be great deception the hon member for bath wera hobhouse call it stupid unnecessary and dangerous she do not mince her word very much my hon friend the member for nottingham east nadia whittome lay many of the myth of the bill to rest and question why the government be push it in the first place the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas point out the political theatre behind the bill and why it be completely incompatible with our climate change commitment this really be reprehensible bill it be bill base on number of myth and frankly lie which require people to believe that there be people around really say that oil and gas be go to be stop immediately and will not continue to play substantial role as it will in the energy economy up to no one be say that oil and gas will not continue up to period of time and no one be say that the exist field in the uk will not continue to produce and contribute their product in the future there will be job in that continue north sea oil operation however this be one clause bill with effectively two section in it the first section ostentatiously require the oil and gas authority to do what it be already do indeed both the hon member for angus dave doogan and the hon member for brighton pavilion remind we that the oil and gas authority have be carry out regular licensing round every month since it be require to do so because it be bind by the maximum economic extraction requirement all that be already in legislation and the oil and gas authority be already do it the second section set out an entirely bogus climate test which by definition can not be fail that be achieve by skew the test condition to test uk gas production emission only against aggregate liquefy natural gas import which be overall likely to be dirty in production than uk gas and not against pipeline deliver gas that in the case of our main importer norway be half as dirty in production as gas in the uk there be no emission test for oil despite its constitute of north sea fossil of which as we have hear be ship and refine overseas for oil there be net importer test which require the oga to issue licence if the demand for oil and gas product in the uk be great than the production when that have be the case in the north sea for year with no prospect of reversal it be bill build on completely bogus premise the hon gentleman be talk about bogus premise but he just suggest that we could get more pipeline gas from norway do he not recognise that if we do not produce as much gas here it will not be gas from norway that we can access but will inevitably be lng with high emission will he please for the benefit of the house step up and be honest we do not have the option to get massively more gas from norway if we do we would have do it already think be go to get injury time for that intervention if the minister have be listen to what be say he would know that be state that the bill in very bogus way have deliberately sidestep the fact that there be gas available for import that be much clean than our in its production we should use that as test but the only test carry out be on lng which conveniently be little bit dirty than the gas we produce in this country the bill be about not what it say as much as what it do as the former energy minister and author of the government net zero report the former right hon member for kingswood say recently the bill go against everything the uk be say internationally about move away from oil and gas and it have already damage our international stance by appear to double down on precisely the thing to which we be say the opposite on the world stage the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma the former president of glasgow cop say in courageous and precise speech this evening that the bill put into legislation something that already happen under the agency of the oga he also state that its sole purpose be to double down on more oil and that nation around the world will not take that very kindly as far as our commitment be concern the oga itself emphasise that the bill be not necessary but would significantly challenge one of the tenet of independence for the nsta to decide when to run licensing round whatever the position in the north sea objectively the oga would be force to scrape up at least licence year forever we know the claim that that would somehow do something for energy security be also bogus the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may recently say that new oil and gas licence only provide for energy security if all that energy be sell into the uk and actually it will be sell on the world market point that number of member have make this afternoon the whole bill appear to have come about as result of wheeze cook up by couple of strategy adviser over heavy lunch to put the opposition on the wrong foot or to put it another way on the right side of history quite honestly that wheeze should have be put down as soon as the effect of the heavy lunch wear off but instead it have persist through the corridor of power and have finally make it to the floor of the house in the shape of this risible bill the content of which evaporate on the first examination by anybody of its serious purpose that say rather more about the state of the government than anything else where be the quality control on policy making how do something so evidently content free and fact averse as this piece of legislation ever make it so far how do the present departmental government ministers for whom have great deal of respect allow it to happen on their watch when they must know it be load of hokum with no policy merit at all now they be force to go out and try to justify it to the house it be very sad reflection of what tiny bitter and sad space the government have retreat into where serious policy development in the energy sphere god know we have enough of that to be work on be replace by such ill advise emptiness that be what this bill be in the end just empty if pass it will linger on the statute book for short period make no difference to anything in the meantime and be rapidly overtake by the reality of the forward march to decarbonisation in energy however the bill will have one last effect as have mention because it signal strongly and be afraid potentially lastingly that the uk be not serious about its climate and net zero ambition and be prepared to say duplicitous thing on both an international and national stage that be bad news for all the genuine work that have so far be do by the uk on net zero climate leadership this bill will not stick but that charge might for that reason if for no other of the many reason that have be put forward in this debate it be good that we take this bill no far than second reading and refuse as house to let it pass to further stage thank my right hon friend the members for read west sir alok sharma and for chelmsford vicky ford and my hon friend the members for waveney peter aldous for moray douglas ross for stoke on trent central jo gideon for banff and buchan david duguid for broadland jerome mayhew and for south dorset richard drax for their contribution to this interesting debate the uk be the global climate leader it be under this government that that position have be secure how be it to be measure do we have objective measure of course we have the central challenge be to reduce emission and under the conservatives this country have reduce emission by more than any major economy on earth how have we do that have it be an accident no it have not we inherit an absolutely awful situation we hear from the hon member for llanelli dame nia griffith about her time in government and she talk strongly about the work that labour do on renewable well it do not add up to much under she and the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband renewable be less than of our electricity in now that have be transform coal the dirty of fossil fuel be far ghastly legacy of the labour party we hear so much piety from labour members but what be their performance in government will tell you madam deputy speaker it be failure nearly of our electricity come from coal as recently as by october this year it will be zero it be the conservative government who have stay laser focused on deliver climate leadership and it be in that light that this legislation come before the house the shadow minister the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead ask why we have introduce the bill the labour party the scottish national party and of course the liberal democrats say that we must have no new licensing in the north sea even as our production be expect to halve over the next decade and despite the fact that if we fulfil our world lead ambition for and which we will production of oil and gas in the north sea will fall even fast in the country that be decarbonise more than any other major economy on earth that be the reality that be the context for the bill which bring in annual licensing rise the labour party will support oil and gas job just not in this country not have new licence here will make no difference whatsoever to our consumption but it will make difference to how much we have to import and our import dependency will go up bad than that for those of we who care about the environment and to put in their place the piety that we hear from opposition party it will actually lead to import with high emission than production here as the right hon member for doncaster north and other labour members know and will worsen our ability to move to net zero in the short term that be not to mention the job support throughout the country plus of which be in the north east of scotland and be abandon by the scottish national party rise the measure will make no difference to our consumption and no difference to world consumption because we be net importer we be not spill our product on to global market our oil for instance which the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas often mention be refine at european refinery it be then turn into product that we can use here it contribute directly to european and uk energy security rise if member oppose the bill and allow no new licensing the impact will be high emission and they will not see the investment that we be see in new project such as rosebank what be the carbon footprint of the product from rosebank it be expect to be much low than the average across the north sea and what be expect globally so again not only do close off licensing mean that we will import more but it will get in the way of investment into and transformation of our base want to see far less import lng can the minister give we some good news on what we might be able to achieve in get more gas out and will he ensure that many block not just one be put up for licence round to get rid of that lng the estimate from the north sea transition authority be that billion of barrel of oil equivalent include gas would be lose if we do not have new licence that be lose tax revenue for this country on top of the job and low so far have not mention the ten of billion of pound of tax interruption it be not surprising give how comprehensively easy it be to destroy the labour party argument that the right hon member for doncaster north keep up his constant chuntering he can not win the argument while he be on his foot so he sit there and try interrupt those who can if we do not have new licensing which be labour policy we will see emission go up in the short term job undermine ten of billion in tax not bring into the public exchequer and for those who care about deal with the climate emergency we will lose the very engineering skill and talent that we need to retain in this country in order to make the transition rise in the time have will try to respond to few of the point that have be make by colleague my hon friend the member for waveney highlight the commitment of oil and gas company to net zero oil and gas business be fund clean energy work the hon member for brent north barry gardiner pick on one such business and it turn out that it be invest heavily in our clean energy transition my hon friend the member for moray talk about fight for those scottish worker have already mention the hon member for llanelli and her rather risible attempt to suggest that labour have any sort of record on renewable my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central emphasise the importance of oil and gas worker to ccus which be absolutely essential my hon friend the member for banff and buchan say that we be reduce production at twice the rate require internationally that be true and it be why new licensing in the north sea be fully align with net zero those emission be part of that the hon member for east lothian kenny macaskill talk about oil and gas be essential to deliver renewable and support new licensing thank he for that my hon friend the member for broadland say that what we use be what count that be so true the most important thing be to look at demand remove and change vehicle factory and home so that they no long use oil and gas be absolutely central my right hon friend the member for chelmsford rightly say how important it be that we present this policy correctly of course if only the labour party be play proper and honest part in that we would be able to champion the tremendous performance of this country in tackle climate change really do appreciate the speech that my right hon friend make will the minister give way the hon member for warwick and leamington matt western talk about the zero carbon home standard and the importance of improve the insulation and energy efficiency of home he be quite right that be why this government have go from the terrible position of just of home have decent insulation epc rat or above when we come to power to above today fundamentally disagree with the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson about net zero but he correctly highlight that we would just be sacrifice well pay job without make any difference to our emission apart from put they up on point of order madam deputy speaker have be in this house long than most people and it be courtesy to the house in wind up speech to give way in an even handed way this minister have give way to conservative member but he refuse to take any intervention from the opposition thank the hon gentleman for that point of order it be up to the minister to decide to whom he give way it would be slightly more usual for he to give way to member who have be in the chamber throughout the debate however it be up to he to decide and really do not like point of order in the middle of wind up speech thank you madam deputy speaker will the minister give way you have give your guidance madam deputy speaker which be to give way to those who have be in the chamber for the debate not to johnny come latelie who come in and want to usurp they the right hon member for east antrim also highlight an excellent point about the hypocrisy and humbug that be absolutely central to labour response to this bill will the minister give way if the hon gentleman who have hardly be here would sit down will fortunately be able to come to close the amendment put forward by his majesty opposition suggest that maximise the fall production from the north sea will put we at the great mercy of petrostate that be so obviously untrue that hope they would hold their head in shame about it that have be at the heart of the opposition approach to this bill the bill be design to send signal to the industry that we have its back it be all about ensure that we get to net zero in the most efficient and effective manner possible and it will underpin this government continue leadership on climate now and for many year to come urge the house to support the bill well that be lively laughter now that have members attention want to emphasise how important it be for those who have participate in debate to get back in good time for the winding up speech when the wind up come up early please just keep an eye out for they and make sure to come back because people who have participate will be mention in the wind up and it be courteous to be here to hear they on point of order madam deputy speaker could just make it clear to the house that be not here for the main debate but come in for the wind up because be chair committee look at the future of hydrogen apologise to the house that be delay thank you thank the hon gentleman for that clarification nevertheless it be true that it be up to the minister to decide to whom he want to give way question put that the amendment be make diane abbott debbie

wiggin on behalf of the committee of selection ai scam consumer protection motion make and question propose that this house do now mann be grateful for the opportunity to raise this important topic of protect consumer from artificial intelligence scam or ai scam as will refer to they understand that this topic have not be debate specifically in this house before but it have be reference in multiple debate can understand why this topic be new at one point it may well have be science fiction but now it be science fact not only that it be probably matter of fact that society be increasingly at risk of technology drive crime and criminality new category which call ai assist criminal and ai assist crime be emerge they can operate anywhere in the world know everything about their choose victim and be seemingly invisible to detection this ai assist crime be grow and become ever more sophisticated will share some example in my speech but let we address the big picture before begin first appreciate that this entire debate may be new to many what exactly be an ai scam why do consumer even need to be protect from something that many would argue do not yet exist let we step back slightly to explain the big picture we live in world where social medium be everywhere in our life our home and our pocket social medium have connect community in way we never think possible but for all the positive it be also as see as member of the online safety public bill committee full of risk and harm we share our thought our connection and most notably our datum be confident that if any government ask citizen to share the same personal datum that many give away for free to social media platform there would be uproar and probably march on the street but every day for the benefit of free usage relevant advertisement and ultimately convenience our life be share by we in detail with friend and family and in some case the entire world we have ultimately become data source and my fear be that this datum this personal datum will be harvest increasingly for use with ai for criminal purpose when say datum do not just mean person name or birth date the name of friend family and colleague their job or their place of work but their face their voice their fear and their hope their very identity congratulate the hon gentleman on raise this issue there be case of fraud in northern ireland last year which cost we some million there be the fraud experience by business when fraudster pose as legitimate organisation seek personal or financial detail there be identity theft and now there be the ai scam that require consumer protection do the hon gentleman agree that more must be do to ensure that our vulnerable and possibly old constituent be aware of the warn sign to look out for in order to protect they and their hard earn finance from scammer and now in particular the ai scamming that could lead to tragedy for many of those elderly and vulnerable people absolutely agree with the hon gentleman fear that this be yet another opportunity for criminal to scam the most vulnerable and that it will reach across the digital divide in way that we can not even imagine as have say this concern the very identity that we have online this datum can ultimately be harvest by criminal to scam to fool to threaten or even to blackmail the victim send their hard earn cash to the criminal before the criminal disappear into the ether net some may argue that be fearmongere and that be somehow against progress but be not see the vast benefit of ai see the opportunity in healthcare for early diagnosis improve patient experience enable single patient view across health and social care so that disparate system can work together and treatment involve not just individual body part but individual themselves ai will improve efficiency in business through customer service and personalisation and will do so many other wonderful thing it will for instance create new generation of job and opportunity however we must recognise that ai be like fire it can be both good and bad fire can warm our home and keep we safe or unwatched can burn it down the rapidly emerge harm that be raise be so fast move that we may be engulf by they before we realise the risk be not lone voice on this back in the dawes centre for future crime at ucl produce report on ai enable future crime it place audio visual impersonation at the top of the list of for high concern crime along with tailor phishing and large scale blackmail more recently in may mcafee cybersecurity artificial intelligence report entitle beware the artificial impostor share the risk of voice clone and deepfake and reveal how common ai voice scam be attack many more people in their life and their home only quarter of adult survey have share experience of such scam although that will increase over time and only of the adult question have even hear of voice enable scam the practice be grow more rapidly than the number of people who be aware that it exist in the first place will share my thought on education and prevention later in my speech increasingly online there be example of deepfake and ai impersonation be use both for entertainment and as warning many will now have hear of deepfake from taylor swift supposedly sell kitchenware to various actor be replace by deepfake in famous role jim carrey in the shining for example many may be view as bit of fun to watch until one realise the danger and risk that ai such as deepfake and clone audio can pose an example be the frightening deepfake video of volodymyr zelensky that be broadcast on hack ukrainian tv falsely order the country troop to surrender to russia thankfully people spot it and know that it be not real we also know that there be big risk for the upcoming election here in the us and elsewhere in the world and for democracy itself the challenge be that the ease with which convince deepfake and cloned voice can be make be rapidly open up scam opportunity on an unprecedented scale affect not only politician and celebrity but individual in their own home the challenge we face be that fraudster be often not necessarily close to home recent report by which point out that the city of london police estimate that over of fraud experience by uk victim could have an international component either involve offender in the uk and overseas work together or the fraud be drive solely by fraudster base outside the uk which also share how ai tool such as chatgpt and bard can be use to create convincing corporate email from the like of paypal that could be misuse by unscrupulous fraudster in this instance such ai assist crime be simply an extension of the exist email fraud and scam we be already use to if we imagine that it be not email from corporation but video call or clone voice message from love one we might suddenly see the scale of the risk be aware that have be refer to various report and story but let please give some context to what these scam can look like in real life give the time available shall give just couple of recent example report by the medium perhaps one of the most extreme be report in the independent in the us mother from arizona share her story with local news show on wkyt she state that she have pick up call from an unknown number and hear what she believe to be her year old daughter sob the voice on the other end of the line say mom mess up before male voice take over and make threatening demand she share that this man get on the phone and he like listen here ve get your daughter the apparent kidnapper then threaten the mother and the daughter in the background the mother say she could hear her daughter say help mom please help and cry the mother state it be her voice it be never question of who be this it be completely her voice it be her inflection it be the way she would have cry never doubt for one second it be she that be the freaky part that really get to my core the apparent kidnapper demand money for the release of the daughter the mother only realise that her daughter be safe after friend call her husband and confirm that that be the case this have be deepfake ai clone her daughter voice to blackmail and threaten another example be report in the daily mail canadian couple be target by an ai voice scam and lose canadian dollar this ai scam target parent who be trick by convincing ai clone of their son voice tell they that he be in jail for kill diplomat in car crash the ai caller state that they need canadian dollar for legal fee before go to court and the frightened parent collect the cash from several bank and send the scammer the money via bitcoin in this instance the report share that the parent file police report once they realise that they have be scamme they say the money go there no insurance there no get it back it go these example in my view be the canary in the mine be sure that over recent year we have all receive at least one scam text message they be usually pretty unconvincing but that be because they be dumb message in the sense that there be no context but let we imagine that like the example have mention the message be not text but phone call or even video call and that we can see love one face or hear their voice the conversation could be as real as it would be if we be speak to that love one in person perhaps they will ask how we be perhaps they will mention something we recently do together an event we attend nickname we use or even band that we be fan of something that we would think only friend or family member would know on the call they might say that they be in trouble and ask we to send or perhaps as they have lose their bank card or ask for some personal banking information because it be an emergency be sure that many people would not think twice about help love one only to find out that the person they speak to be not real but an ai scam and that the information the person speak about with an ai clone voice be freely available on the victim facebook page or elsewhere online imagine that this scam happen not to one person but to hundred of thousand of people within the space of few minute these ai assist criminal could make hundred of thousand of pound perhaps million of pound before anyone work out that they have be scamme the ai technology to do this be already here and will soon be unleash so we need to protect consumer now before it arrive on everyone phone and before it impact our constituent and even our economy in way that we can not imagine because of the precise topic of the debate will not stray too far into how this technology raise major concern for the upcoming election we could easily debate for hour the risk of people receive call from love one on the day of the election convince they to vote different way or not to vote at all everything that have say today be bear out by the evidence and prediction the federal trade commission have already warn that ai be be use to turbocharge scam so it be just matter of time and time be run out how do we protect consumer from ai scam first be aware that the government be on the front foot with ai be fortunate to attend the prime minister speech on ai last year speech that genuinely believe will be consider in decade to come to be one of the most important make by prime minister because amid all the global challenge we face he be look to long term challenge that we do not know we be face appreciate that the government have say that they expect to have robust mechanism in place to stop the spread of ai power disinformation before the general election but the risk of deepfake go far and wide and the economic impact of ai scam be already predict by some medium outlet to run into the billion the daily hodl report that the late number from the us federal trade commission show that imposter scam account for billion of loss in the secretary of state for science innovation and technology have say that the rise of generative ai which can be use to create write audio and video content have make it easy for people to create more sophisticated misleading content and amplify an exist risk around online disinformation with the knowledge that the government be ahead of the game on ai ask that the minister who know this topic inside out consider some simple measure first will he consider legislation guideline or simple framework to create ture clause everyone know that ture say technology would one day be able to fool human and that time seem to be here the principle of ture clause would be that any application or use of ai where the intention be to pretend to be human must be clearly label believe we can begin this by encourage all government departments and all organisation that work with the government to have clear labelling simple example would be chatbot it must be clearly identify where person be speak to an ai not to real human being secondly believe there be great opportunity for the government to support research and development within the industry to create accredited antivirus style ai detection for use in phone computer and other technology this would be similar to the rise of antivirus software in the early day of the world wide web the technology premise would be to help to identify the risk that ai be be use in any communication with an individual for example the technology could be use to provide contextual alert that phone call text message or other communication might be ai generate or manipulate such as call from suppose family member receive from an unknown phone number in the same way as anti virus software warn of computer user of malware risk that could become commonplace system that allow the public to be alert to ai risk and it could position the uk as superpower in police ai around the world we could create the technology that other country use to protect their citizen by in effect create ai police and alert system thirdly would like to find out what if any engagement be take place with insurance company and bank to make sure they protect consumer affect by ai scam be conscious that the ai scam that be likely to convince victim will most likely get they to do thing willingly so it be much hard for consumer to be protect because before they even realise they have be fool by what they believe be love one but be in fact an ai voice clone or video deepfake they will have already give over their money do not want insurance company and bank to use that against our consumer and the public when they have be fool by something that be incredibly sophisticated further ask relate to the fact that prevention be well than cure we therefore need to help the public to identify ai scam for example by suggest that they use codeword when speak to love one on the phone or via video call so that they know they be real the public should be cautious about unknown caller we need to make they aware that that be the most likely way of get phone call that be deepfake or be by cloned voice and that put they at risk we should also encourage people not to act too quickly when ask to transfer money as state by the hon member for strangford jim shannon the most vulnerable will be the old people in society those who be most worried about these thing we need to make sure they be aware of what be possible and to make it clear that this be about not science fiction but science fact finally appreciate that this fall under department different from the minister but would like to understand what mechanism both via policing and through the court be be explore to both deter and track down ai assist crime and criminal so that we can not only find the individual who be push and create this technology they will no doubt be those in serious and organised crime gang but shut down their technology at source to conclude unlike some do not subscribe to the belief that the end of the world be nigh or even that the end of the world be ai hope member excuse the pun however it would be wrong not to be wary of the risk that we know about and the fact that there be many many unknown unknown in this space our ability to be nimble in the face of grow risk be must and spot early warning sign several of which have outline today be essential we may not see this happen every day now but there be real risk that in the next year or two and definitely within decade we will see it on very regular basis in way that even have not be able to predict today so we need to look beyond the potential economic and democratic opportunity to the potential economic and democratic harm that ai could inflict on we all scam such as those have outline could ruin people life mentally financially and in so many other way if it be not worth do all we can now to avoid that do not know when the right time be so along with respond to my point will the minister recommend that colleague throughout the house become familiar with the risk of ai scam so that they can warn their constituent ask members also to consider join the fantastic all party group on artificial intelligence which help these thing the scam the opportunity and much more to be discuss regularly thank the minister for his time and look forward to hear his response first let put on the record how pleased be to see my hon friend the member for watford dean russell back in his place have hear about his health issue say that not just because his parent be constituent of mine or because he be bear and bring up in my constituency but because he be dear friend of mine thank my hon friend for secure this debate and raise the important issue of ai scam and the use of ai to defraud or manipulate people assure he that the government take the issue very seriously technology be fast move landscape and the pace of recent development in artificial intelligence exemplify the challenge with which we be present when it come to protect our society will start by be very clear safely deploy ai will bring great benefit and promise to revolutionise our economy society and everyday life that include benefit for fraud prevention on which we be work closely with the home office and other departments across government properly use ai can and do form the heart of system that manage risk detect suspect activity and prevent million of scam text from reach potential victim however as my hon friend rightly identify ai also bring challenge to reap the huge social and economic benefit of ai we must manage the risk that it present to do so and thereby maintain public trust in these technology be key to effectively develop deploy and adopt ai in the long term ai provide the mean to enhance and upscale the ability of criminal to defraud lone individual could be enable to operate like an organised crime gang conduct sophisticated personalised fraud operation at scale and my hon friend speak eloquently about some of the risk of ai the government have take technology neutral approach the online safety act will provide significant protection from online fraud include where al have be use to perpetrate scam more broadly on the service it regulate the act will regulate ai generate content in much the same way that it regulate content create by human under the online safety act all regulated service will be require to take proactive action to tackle fraud facilitate through user generate content be conscious that my hon friend may have introduce new phrase into the lexicon when he speak of ai assist criminal be confident that the online safety act will be key to tackle fraud when user share ai generate content with other user in addition the act will mandate an additional duty for the large and most popular platform to prevent fraudulent pay for advertising appear on their service this represent major step forward in ensure that internet user be protect from scam the government be take broad action on fraud beyond the online safety act in may the home office publish fraud strategy to address the threat of fraud the strategy set out an ambitious and radical plan for how the government law enforcement regulator industry and charity will work together to tackle fraud on the point raise by the hon member for strangford jim shannon the government be work with industry to remove the vulnerability that fraudster exploit with intelligence agency to shut down fraudulent infrastructure and with law enforcement to identify and bring the most harmful offender to justice we be also work with all our partner to ensure that the public have the advice and support that they need the fraud strategy set an ambitious target to cut fraud by from level down to million fraud incident by the end of this parliament crime survey datum show that we be currently at this target level but we be not complacent and we continue to take action to drive down fraud our million investment in law enforcement and the launch of new national fraud squad will help to catch more fraudster we be work with industry to block fraud include by stop fraudster exploit call and text to target victim we have already block more than million scam text from reach the public and the strategy will enable we to go much far social medium company should carefully consider the legality of different type of datum scrap and implement measure to protect against unlawful datum scraping they also have datum protection obligation concern third party scraping from their website which we be strengthen in the data protection and digital information bill that bill will hit rogue firm that hound people with nuisance call with tough fine the maximum fine be currently under the bill it will rise to of global turnover or million whichever be great to well tackle rogue activity and punish those who pester people with unwanted call and message thank the minister for comprehensive and detailed response to the hon member for watford it be quite encouraging my intervention focus on the elderly and vulnerable what can be do for those who fall specifically into that category it be great honour to be intervene on by the hon gentleman who make an important point the government will be do more awareness raising which will be key be willing to work with the hon gentleman to ensure that we make progress because it be key target that we must achieve consumer be far protect by the privacy and electronic communications ec directive regulations which govern the rule for direct marketing by electronic mean under these regulation organisation must not send marketing text phone call or email to individual without their specific prior consent we be also strengthen these regulation which mean that anyone try to contact someone with unwanted marketing communication call can be fin if they could cause harm or disturbance to individual even if they go unanswered by victim beyond legislation the home office and the prime minister anti fraud champion work with lead online service provider to create an online fraud charter the charter which be launch in november last year set out voluntary commitment from some of the large tech firm in the world to reduce fraud on their platform and service and to raise good practice across the sector this include commitment to improve the blocking of fraud at source make report fraud easy for user and be more responsive in remove content and ad find to be fraudulent the charter will also improve intelligence sharing and well educate user about the risk on platform and service in response to the point of the hon member for strangford public awareness be key defence against all fraud whether or not ai enable as set out in the fraud strategy we have be work with lead counter fraud expert and wide industry to develop an eye catch public comms campaign which we anticipate go live next month this will streamline fraud communication and help people spot and take action to avoid fraud none the less it be important to remember that this work be take place in wide context the uk be lead the way in ensure that ai be develop in responsible and safe way allow uk citizen to reap the benefit of this new technology but be protect from its harm in march last year we publish the ai regulation white paper which set out principle for the responsible development of ai in the uk these principle such as safety and accountability be at the heart of our approach to ensure the responsible development and use of ai the uk government show international leadership in this space when we host the world first major ai safety summit last year at bletchley park this be landmark event where we bring together globally representative group of world leader business academia and civil society to unite for crucial talk to explore and build consensus on collective international action which would promote safety at the frontier of ai we recognise the concern around ai model generate large volume of content that be indistinguishable from human generate picture voice recording or video enable user and institution to determine what medium be real be key part of tackle wide range of ai risk include fraud my hon friend have bring forward the idea of label to make it clear when ai be use the government have strong track record of support private sector innovation include in this field innovation from the safety tech sector will play central role in provide the technology that online company need to protect their user from harm and to shape safe internet beyond that government support measure provide blueprint for support other solution to keep user safe such as championing research into the art of the possible include via the annual uk safety tech sectoral analysis report and drive innovative solution via challenge fund in partnership with gchq and the home office dsit have already publish good practice relate to ai identifier which can aid the identification of ai generate content in the emerge process for frontier ai safety document which be publish ahead of the ai safety summit in the light of that dsit continue to investigate the potential for detect and label ai generate content that include both assess technical evidence on the feasibility of such detection and the lever that we have as policymaker to ensure that it be deploy in beneficial way more broadly last year the government announce million to set up an expert taskforce to help the uk to adopt the next generation of safe ai the very first of its kind the taskforce have now become the ai safety institute which be convene new global network and facilitate collaboration across international partner industry and civil society the ai safety institute be engage with lead ai company that be collaboratively share access to their ai model for vital safety research we be make the uk the global centre of ai safety place where company at the frontier know that the guardrail be in place for they to seize all the benefit of ai while mitigate the risk as result the uk remain at the forefront of develop cutting edge technology to detect and mitigate online harm uk firm already have market share in global safety tech sector ai create new risk but as have set out it also have the potential to super charge our response to tackle fraud and to make our everyday life well the government be take action across range of area to ensure that we manage the risk and capitalise on the benefit of these new technology thank all member who have speak in the debate and again thank my hon friend the member for watford for introduce this debate on ai scam which assure he and the house be government priority question put and agree to house adjourn
