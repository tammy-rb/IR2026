entirely agree give the tragedy that they have experience it would have be possible for ceri and frances menai davis to simply collapse but they do not they decide that they be go to do something positive so they set up charity the enthusiasm and strength of determination that that couple bring to this situation be something to be see and certainly pay tribute to they my right hon friend the member for charnwood respond to the debate by explain that we be work on achieve well long term plan for the early diagnosis of cancer include rare cancer and on try to prevent what have happen to jessica from happen again hertfordshire hospital trust be work extremely hard on that the government aim be for three quarter of cancer to be diagnose at stage or which would enable an additional people to survive cancer for five year long than they do now as well as new hospital we need to see that improvement in diagnosis which be already take place in the rapid diagnostic centre and service that the new integrate care board have be press for there be currently live rapid diagnostic centre pathway in addition east and north hertfordshire nhs trust inform by experience such as jessica but also bear in mind what have happen in the case of hugh be work on much more co ordinate multi disciplinary approach what this show be that we be at the start of new era with well hospital service and an understanding of the need to prioritise cancer not just in the elderly but in the young and in respect of not just the well know cancer but the rare one pay tribute to the work of the all party parliamentary group on cancer which support the aspect of the bill raise by my constituent be the financial impact on parent of have to spend month in hospital support sick young child my constituent be self employ and it cost he lot to put his child first but he be able to manage not only because of his strong personal finance but because of the support of his family in keep his business go however he fear for other who be less fortunate and find themselves in the same position he give example of people his charity be help people who be lose their livelihood to support their child in hospital as have say have raise the financial issue with ministers in the department for work and pensions and the department of health and social care and have be point to some limited help for parent such as leave entitlement often unpaid and bereavement leave as well as universal credit under which if income go down the benefit go up parent who have work for the same employer for at least year be entitle to week of unpaid parental leave and there may be help from disability and carer benefit after period in this bill ask for report to be make to parliament by the secretary of state on the merit of provide financial support to the parent of child receive care in hospital for extend period be ask for an assessment of current policy and the likely effect of some additional support on both parent and child and be ask the government to consult parent healthcare professional charity and other offer support although it never you be the focus of what ceri and frances be do have also hear from other charity such as together for short life which talk about the huge financial strain on family of have child in hospital and young live vs cancer that charity want to raise one particular issue the nhs do offer healthcare travel cost support scheme but apparently the operation of that scheme be not very helpful it be ponderous and do not deliver the money quickly enough perhaps that be something the report could look into hope it will also be possible for meeting to take place between the minister and mr and mrs menai davis so that they can explain what they hope to get from the process the bill would not cost great deal as there be so few case but it would mean that in tragic circumstance all parent could concentrate on help their child rather than worry about money in way the bill be also about ceri menai davis and his wife frances be able to help other parent who find themselves in the situation they find themselves in the report be likely to touch on some of the other issue that family have take up with ministers and that have raise in my remark and hope it will inform holistic approach to improve care for young cancer patient and their parent it would be legacy for hugh we could call it hugh report mr deputy speaker sir roger gale call the opposition front bencher vicky foxcroft lewisham deptford lab congratulate the right hon and learn

research and produce report on both the emotional and tangible support that be available and that which be need like the support that the charity be give but look at thing in more join up way to work well and more effectively for parent during such difficult time stand here as somebody who have have cancer more than once you do not choose it it choose you as ceri and frances know your world be

issue and stop the pain of thinking that they be the only one know that nothing stop the lie awake at night watch the clock tick through the hour and hop for miracle but we want to help family who be go through such difficult time commit from the dispatch box to work closely with my right hon and learn friend the member for north east hertfordshire on this important issue in particular we be

and in ceri word that there be purpose to the pain mr deputy speaker sir roger gale with the leave of the house call sir oliver heald to wind up sir oliver heald be delighted by the response which basically give what ask for in the bill of course if the bill go through all stage in this house and the lords it would take many month before we could start the process think my hon friend the

the motion motion and bill by leave withdraw motion make that the bill be now read second time hon member object bill to be read second time on friday february motion make that the bill be now read second time hon member object bill to be read second time on friday january motion make that the bill be now read second time hon member object bill to be read second time on friday march motion make and question propose that this house do now morrissey stella creasy walthamstow lab co op the government intend to introduce charge of time to import thing from the eu into the uk from april that might come as surprise to many business because they do not know about it and most of our constituent likely do not think that be because the government be not even sure that they want to do it today hope to get some answer about the border operating model on behalf of all those who will pay the price if it actually happen namely the british public brexit be the gift that keep give like contract recurrent food poisoning we think we have see the bad of it only to feel that sick feeling in our stomach again pint of wine and blue passport can not make up for the inflationary impact of this late dose of extra paperwork and delay for the avoidance of doubt we have leave the european union the government can not make brexit work and it be cause problem to million of people every day be not stand here advocate that we ask to rejoin either frankly with all the problem we be face for business and job because of it we do not have time for such treaty negotiation this debate be about what this government be do now to manage our border and the very real consequence of their decision for food security and the cost and nutrition of food currently the uk import around of our food we be self sufficient for our trade with other country be the reason why we have food to eat and be not all just eat turnip and cabbage delicious though those home grow delicacy be in we import billion worth of fruit and vegetable from the eu billion worth of drink and the same amount of meat the eu account for of all the dairy beef egg and pork product come to the uk and nearly two third of all food and feed not of animal origin some of that be from just four country the netherlands ireland germany and france it be little wonder that brexit have already hit our food price and supply research from the centre for economic performance at the london school of economics show that we all see the empty shelf and rationing and business be clear that it be brexit not ukraine and the energy crisis that be push up the price of production and cause all those problem that be all before we even get to the new import control it be combination of high transport cost supply chain design custom complexity and reduce volume whatever we do at the border will be critical to the nation capacity to eat more than porridge give that oat be one of the few thing for which we produce of what we consume let we not pretend that other country can pick up the slack for we although the government be negotiate free trade agreement with six other country and have two agree these will not be able to replace the food we import from the eu and if we care about animal welfare we should want to work with the eu because it still have equivalent animal welfare standard contrary to australia and new zealand from which food can now be import tariff free without any equivalence to our welfare standard frankly geography matter which be why add more friction to the process will lead not only to shortage and delay but to inflation and cost for everyone under this tory hard brexit we leave the eu customs union the single market and the vat area and we have be threaten our own custom control ever since understandably business have be drive mad by the fact that those control have be postpone five time in the meantime we have all be stick with the bill at the checkout the white elephant of brexit stand empty at our expense as the government have spend more than million on border facility and job sevington in kent cost million include million on the border control post infrastructure alone and million have be spend on portsmouth million on holyhead and million on north weald be sure those community would rather use the money for something else in theory all of that will finally change this year in just day time if business want to import pork beef reindeer camel frog leg cream yoghurt flour beeswax but not honey or animal paw they will need health certificate that all mean find vet who will sign the health check minister have tell that more than half of the expect million annual cost of the scheme to business will come from these certificate but they have also say that it be not as bad as the more onerous tracking system they previously suggest which would have cost business million year frankly that be like tell my kid that they should be grateful that have let they keep the bell on their lindt bunny because be originally go to take that too along with all the chocolate health certificate be one thing but the government have also be consult on introduce charge to cover the cost of the scheme the so call common user charge that be plan for april just day away the consultation say the charge could be but it might be less or more it would be helpful for british business to know whether it be come in at all in day time as well as know what the charge will be the charge be intend to apply to each consignment whether it be one leg of lamb or van full of reindeer and frog leg as of lorry come into this country carry multiple consignment know as groupage it be clear how expensive this way of apply the charge will be the government have therefore choose to fund the new border by impose fee directly on business that import the pledge that brexit would be bonfire of regulation turn into smoulder pile of paperwork that will kill import for small business it do not have to be that way veterinary deal with europe could remove the requirement for export health certificate join the pan european mediterranean convention which be wide than the eu and include israel and north african country would also help as business could make use of the eu hub where product from outside be often consolidated frankly even if business pay there be no guarantee that they will get service the government be plan to check just of import just when think it could not get any more complicated in day time they want to introduce safety and security declaration for all eu import these will be require even if the pallet come in on truck be empty it rely on the single trade window process not be total disaster yet at present business have no idea whether the technology be work of course all of this be different for business trade from northern ireland those not for eu sticker which will help to protect the border with the eu and ireland reflect the lunacy of all those people who try to argue that technology could prevent trade barrier in situation where we be the small market it be not hard to see that when company trade in multiple nation be face with such policy they will move away from do business with we focus instead on less complicated market between and the eu account for to of uk export by that have already fall to trader in belgium have already publicly say that they be not go to spend any more time try to figure out what the government be up to they say that they have be march up the hill too many time only for the scheme to be delay at the last minute they say that they be willing to risk friction rather than the paperwork the institute of export and international trade point out that more than different measure on import will come into force between the end of last september and the end of this year the freight representative point out that the lorry driver need to go through the same entry and exit system and will be in the queue behind the schoolkid and the holidaymaker go check they will be stick behind those school coach with all the knock on effect for the picking up and transportation of import consignment the representative say they estimate that would create around mile of freight traffic turn dover into literal lorry park little wonder that nichola mallon logistics uk head of trade policy say that business have still not be give all of the detail and guidance they need to plan and prepare and that there be high risk of delay traffic congestion high price and reduce choice for consumer we all understand the need for check to stop thing such as african swine flu but give that this country have not even sign up to be part of the share biosecurity alert it be clear that there be other thing we could do to help tackle that those charge with run the service certainly have their doubt health inspector at dover have have cut to their funding to do any of the work to try to stop infection reach our shore in the first place those in dover would know about all this because they be in the frontline goodness know what be happen in the west coast port which be operate to different timetable that will open up further loophole and complication with port such as holyhead pembroke and fishguard which be the land bridge to ireland also face confusion have series of question for the minister and hope that she will take intervention when she respond so that we can get to the bottom of this first and foremost can the minister actually confirm whether any check will be make to lorry on our border in day time to see whether the good in they have environmental health certificate what work be her government do to ensure that there be enough vet in europe to provide the certificate can she confirm whether they even exist if there be not go to be check on lorry in day time as she have previously tell business when will the health certificate check come in what will happen to lorry that do not have one can she confirm that the opening hour for the border control post match the just in time supply chain so that we do not see lorry of rot food sit in our port wait to be check when will the common user charge be apply and what will it be if it be common it should be uniform so can she tell business here and now whether it be happen and what it will be per consignment or whether it will take account of groupage the government say in december that they would provide this information and business be still wait will the minister confirm what the common user charge will cover be it in addition to all the other charge from the port health authority and the animal and plant health agency and do it cover custom fee if the check be not go to be make when will they be make what will she do about traffic management in kent currently there be inspector in the port of dover how many have her department assess be need and why be only of they be check if this be about biosecurity what will they do if lorry go to the wrong port or try to shop around do she expect different border control port to charge the same fee for their service or will they set their own how will she stop those lorry from try to game the system can the minister tell we about the status of the single trade window project and whether fujitsu be involve in its delivery at all the government have admit that this will cause inflation but they be try to claim it be go to be just over three year in their response to they say that will depend greatly on how business adapt their business model and supply chain to integrate the new control regime put the pressure on business to pay for the government scheme will the minister clarify what the variation might be if business do not do that and what have be calculate into inflation if they can not get to grip with the government new system what impact be her department predict that the situation will have on food price in that first year not over three year but in the first year why will this government not come clean on the data source they be use to make those calculation what commercial confidentiality behind calculate inflation and the impact of the policy possibly trump the public right to know how expensive it will be to put food on the table no doubt the minister will say that an outbreak of foot and mouth disease would cost business more than this scheme but will she set out the cost of the administration of this project separately from the health check that the government have calculate can she clarify the timetable for the introduction of the west coast port charge and what the difference in the regime will be will she explain why the government have not negotiate veterinary deal be they even look at the pan euro mediterranean convention to try to solve these problem without give business all this extra paperwork above all what be she do to warn the public about the potential impact on their food supply and cost or be she prepared to say here and now on the record that there will be no delay in food provision no shortage and no increase in price nobody want to eat meat that have be sit in the dock or beeswax that be off even if it have health certificate when it start its journey because of what be happen the uk have already drop from fourth in the world bank logistic performance index to joint the main challenge result from border friction which be contribute to the decline in just in time supply chain and efficient custom it do not take rocket scientist to work out that this scheme will clearly make thing hard for british business no wonder it have be delay five time with so many people struggle with the cost of living crisis surely the good thing be to think again the scheme will make thing hard for british business at bad it will be nightmare ask the minister will she give people some relief and say that it be off again
