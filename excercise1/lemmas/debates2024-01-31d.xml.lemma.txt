impose rationing as child be now self deny with one in pensioner skip meal and one in five go without heat at some point this winter what do the uk government intend to do about this dire situation the uk government fully recognise the importance of support pensioner that be why we have commit to the triple lock and make sure that even through the difficult crisis we have face over the past few year pension have rise in line with inflation on top of that there have be an extra payment of for pensioner and the uk government policy of bring down inflation be go to help everyone in wales and the uk include all pensioner hope the hon lady will agree that that be much well focus than for example bring in road user charging which be go to hit pensioner who want to drive car in wales citizens advice cymru have state that during it refer over people to food bank in wales almost double the number for what do that say about the impact of the government policy on ordinary people in wales as have just outline the uk government be absolutely focused on support those with the least in wales and across the united kingdom that be why the uk government policy of bring down inflation to around half have help everyone and it be why the uk government have make sure that benefit have rise in line with inflation household where there be benefit have receive payment and household where there be disability have receive payment do not for one moment doubt the fact that many people be face serious difficulty at the moment but this government be commit to help they when visit food bank be tell

an impact with small business in wrexham say that they be go to fold despite the uk government maintain the rate at the welsh government be focus more on waste million on mph scheme and increase the number of senedd politician do the secretary of state agree that the welsh labour government should focus on what the people of wales need not what socialist senedd politician want to dictate my hon friend be absolutely right it be disgraceful that pub in wales be go to be pay on average thousand of pound more in business rate because the welsh senedd government have not pass on the money that have be give to they by the uk government and it be disgraceful that small tourism business be face tourism tax levy if the welsh government want to focus on the priority of small business and community in wales they should indeed scrap the plan to spend million on extra senedd members do my right hon friend agree that one of the good way in whichthe welsh labour government can help with the cost of living be by help business create job and support employer such as the iconic lobster pot on anglesey rather than increase business rate punitively and increase the number of senedd members by staggering my hon friend be absolutely right she be huge champion of business in her constituency and it be shame that the senedd do not look to her example of championing business instead of impose all sort of extra taxis while as she mention waste money on scheme such as create extra senedd members and bring in road charge on the even my own labour council be suggest bring back severn bridge toll call the shadow minister some homeowner in wales face the tory mortgage bombshell this month with household project to pay an extra per month as their fix rate deal come to an end despite the conservative party opposition the welsh government have put in place measure to prevent repossession and uk labour government would require bank to protect homeowner what be the secretary of state do to help homeowner face massive bill cause by the conservative party economic mismanagement the uk government have put in place number of measure to support any mortgage holder face difficulty at the moment but the most important measure have be to bring down inflation inflation actually peak at high rate in europe than in the united kingdom inflation be now down at less than half of what it be previously which will have beneficial impact on mortgage interest rate over the long term ask the hon lady whether in all fairness she think that her party plan to borrow billion year which be go to increase inflation and have very bad impact on mortgage interest rate will be good or bad for homeowner call liz saville roberts diolch yn fawr llefarydd the government own estimate warn that new brexit border check will increase the cost of fresh import by million and worsen food inflation the secretary of state use to dismiss warning of brexit border control as scare story will he now admit how wrong he be and recognise that the good way to reduce food inflation which sit at an eye watering would be to rejoin the single market make no apology for rubbish the scare story that come out before brexit take place we be tell that it be go to lead to the collapse of the economy to the collapse of house price to the end of fresh fruit and veg be sell in shop and even to no more magnum ice cream think we be even go to run out of viagra as well at one point the reality be that none of those scare story have happen but it be bit ironic that the right hon lady the leader of the plaid cymru group be demand that we rejoin the european union while at the same time want to take wales out of one of the most successful financial union order secretary of state be this way not that way and you be get little carry away there be few more question and liz saville roberts have another one for you that be brexit fantasy and now we look at the wonder of the uk northern ireland be set to receive over billion and fair funding settlement from the treasury which welcome that include million of pound to help balance budget meanwhile in wales councillor face budget black hole of million which be set to decimate our social service over the next three year these cut will be devastating for people leave without resource during the cost of living crisis as wales man in the cabinet what have the secretary of state do to demand equivalent fair funding for wales first must point out to the right hon lady that since leave the european union our growth rate have be well than that of germany and our manufacturing have now exceed that of france as far as fair funding for wales be concern we receive more per head to spend on devolve service than be spend in england one thing the right hon lady and might agree on be that it be high time the welsh labour government explain why we have long wait list and low educational standard despite have more money to spend on devolve service energy mix what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of the energy mix in wales what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of the energy mix in wales that be lively mr speaker the uk have secure and diverse energy system and wales continue to play key role the uk government be go far to ensure our energy security by support our oil and gas industry and invest to scale up our renewable energy production such as float offshore wind in the celtic sea many of my constituent make the long journey round to work at hinkley yet we have have this government in power for year and we have see no new nuclear deliver in wales despite our proud history of generation with its significant opportunity to lower energy bill deliver high quality job and reduce carbon emission where on earth be their plan and why be they not get on with deliver it very much welcome the hon gentleman mention nuclear seem to recall that when his party be in power labour do next to nothing to advance the cause of nuclear energy in this country it give ample opportunity to pay tribute to the work of my hon friend the member for ynys môn virginia crosbie who have commit the government to everything we have do on wylfa so far progress be be make in stark contrast to the record of his party we have have year of successive tory governments who have all have the chance to invest in the transition to net zero instead they have choose to backslide on climate commitment and it be work people across my constituency of cardiff north who be pay the price with this government intent on issue new oil and gas licence what do the minister say to family in my constituency who be now pay treble for their energy bill would point out that it be this government who step in with billion of support to mitigate the impact of those energy bill completely disagree with the hon lady assessment of our record on net zero and would point out that when her party be in power of our energy supply come from renewable source fourteen year if the hon lady will let finish the point the figure be now just under and that be the record of this party year in power my hon friend mention the new industry of float offshore wind which have huge potential to create large number of high quality job in place such as milford haven and port talbot the two port both have bid in with the uk government to the flowmis port infrastructure scheme which will be key to see this vision realise when can the port expect to hear back about those bid thank my right hon friend the chair of the select committee for that question be delighted that today the crown estate be host bidder day to drive forward plan for innovative float wind project in the celtic sea the uk government be support flow through our contract for difference scheme secure long term pipeline of project in the celtic sea would be happy to write to he with further update on when more progress can be discuss call the shadow secretary of state on the issue of the energy mix the tata worker meet last week know that the virgin steel they make be vital to support our renewable energy aspiration such as offshore wind in the celtic sea so the loss of job be kick in the tooth for our proud and skilled welsh steelworker it will devastate local economy and the sovereign steelmaking capacity that would build the wind turbine we need yet the business secretary tell we at the weekend it not about the job loss do the secretary of state agree with her comment be sorry that the hon lady have reply to that question not the secretary of state it be important to recognise that the investment from this uk government have save thousand of job across the united kingdom of course the transition board be now work with the individual affect in port talbot which be the proper and right thing to do be glad that both the uk and welsh governments be work towards that it be absolutely the right outcome we need to think about these thing in the wide context which be our responsibility the minister boast about the transition board but that only exist because of the government failure to protect job and vital industry each year port talbot provide enough virgin steel to deliver the uk wind target by itself can she tell the house where that steel will come from when her government intervention shut the blast furnace early will it come from india if so we will be surrender our ability to create job investment and cheap bill here in britain mr speaker it will not surprise you to learn that completely disagree with the hon lady assessment would point out that this government have provide the transition board with million we have not see any of the million that the welsh labour government have promise but indication so far be that move away from steelmaking would not have direct impact on national report february vol correction speed limit residential roads whether he have have discussion with the welsh government on the introduction of mph speed limit on residential road and pedestrian street in wales whether he have have discussion with the welsh government on the introduction of mph speed limit on residential road and pedestrian street in wales the welsh government policy on the blanket mph speed limit be damage community and business across wales all of we support mph limit if there be safety reason outside school hospital or old people home but the blanket mph limit be by the welsh government own figure go to create billion hit to the welsh economy in my constituency bus service no long serve dyserth high street or the tweedmill shopping outlet in trefnant which impact on some of the most vulnerable people arriva have state that the welsh government mph policy be key reason for that do the secretary of state agree that the welsh government have fail in multiple way to properly consider the impact of their policy and that they should repeal it in full my hon friend be absolutely correct not only have the welsh government not consider the impact of this policy on the economy business and commuter but they have fail to consider the impact on user of public transport we be see bus timetable across the whole of wales be rip up because of this daft policy the welsh labour government seem determined to apply handbrake to the welsh economy blanket mph zone do not command widespread public support and as consequence be widely ignore and unenforceable furthermore there be very little evidence that they improve road safety or air quality the roll out of the scheme in wales have prove to be an utter farce do my right hon friend share my concern that the labour party have not learn its lesson and would no doubt seek to impose this costly and disastrous policy in england be it to be elect my hon friend be correct not only have the welsh labour government not consider this policy but they have ignore the fact that people have sign petition call on they to reconsider the large petition in the history of the senedd he be also correct to say that if labour government be ever elect in this country certainly hope that will not happen it be inevitable that they would pursue anti motorist policy such as the mph speed limit ban on new road be build and congestion charge and emission zone be set up all over the place the south wales argus of december inform we that the secretary of state for wales outline his anger that the mph speed limit in caerwent be not be enforce properly by the police be he still angry begin my response early by say that all of we in this house support mph speed limit where there be an issue of safety and could not be more clear about that what do not support be blanket mph limit alongside that blanket mph limit on mph road the welsh labour government be use underhand method to bring down the speed limit on perfectly safe dual carriageway from mph to mph that be what lie in store if labour be ever elect to government in the rest of the country clearly the mph speed limit that be be enforce in wales will restrict people in their movement have the minister have any discussion with the welsh assembly on provide more bus to take people out of their car and will there be more provision for cyclist if there be not that provision this system can not work unfortunately welsh senedd ministers do not seem interested in reconsider the policy frankly there be an anti motorist agenda with the welsh labour government which have see blanket mph speed limit speed reduction on dual carriageway congestion charge be consider and charge to use the most shockingly of all my own labour council be consider bring back severn bridge toll rail infrastructure what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the adequacy of rail infrastructure in wales have regular discussion with colleague across government on rail infrastructure the uk government be commit to build strong rail infrastructure network across wales which will improve connectivity and drive economic growth we have provide over million for welsh rail in recent year and we recently announce furth billion to fund the electrification of the north wales main line the welsh affairs committee highlight the need for great connectivity between swansea cardiff and bristol which would be of huge benefit particularly for sport and music fan come to ashton gate in my constituency why have the wales rail board fail to initiate recommendation and other further improvement the hon lady constituent will be greatly affect by the project that she mention and by the performance of great western railway which be not sufficient the office of rail and road have launch an investigation into poor train punctuality and reliability in network rail wales and western region and we await the recommendation of that review add that industrial action have affect thing will my hon friend join in congratulate network rail and its subcontractor on complete the repair work on the long wooden rail bridge in europe across the mawddach estuary in gwynedd certainly will join my hon friend and be delighted that he take such keen interest in welsh rail infrastructure and raise it here on such regular basis he be right to flag that project which be an example of this government record investment in rail infrastructure in wales be pleased to visit the project and give it my full support steelmake what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the future of the steelmaking industry in wales what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the future of the steelmaking industry in wales the government be invest million to secure the future of steelmaking in port talbot for generation to come it be one of the large uk government support package for steelmaking in history and it will protect job directly with tata and many thousand more in the supply chain last week the secretary of state state in the steel debate that he understand the devastation that people will feel in port talbot the whole community but especially those people who face the loss of their report january vol at the plant and beyond why be it then that the secretary of state or the business secretary do not put in red line on job loss while this work be be do especially give that tata have this morning double down on those loss at the welsh affairs committee it be nothing short of disgrace as the hon gentleman know tata approach the uk government and say it be intend to pull out of the united kingdom if tata have pull out completely that would have immediately cost job and many thousand more in the supply chain the government therefore act to take the only deal available which be to build the electric arc furnace and save thousand of job do not think that thousand of job will be save at all the people of teesside who see the tory government abandon they and end virgin steelmaking at redcar lead to the loss of job will sympathise with those in wales the failure of the same government will see virgin steelmaking also end in wales with the loss of another job and leave the uk even more reliant on import as they be surrender the market to other country why would the government want to do that when steel be foundation industry and with the introduction of new technology could have bright future hope that the hon gentleman will be aware that of the material the iron ore and coke use to produce steel in port talbot be import from abroad at the same time we be export million tonne of scrap steel so build an arc furnace to make use of that scrap steel will make we less dependent on other country for our steel as far as job loss be concern the uk government have put aside budget of million combine with million from tata to support anyone who lose their job thus far we have not have one single penny towards that from the welsh labour government who by the way be able to find million to create whole load of extra senedd member in cardiff bay know where my priority be with the steelworker steelmaking be essential to our national security as be reach net zero the problem be that the welsh labour government can not make their mind up about which be more important after try to kill off the steel industry with their green measure they now complain that the uk government be not do enough to support that industry do the secretary of state think that they do not really know their acas from their nalgo my hon friend make good point the government have look carefully at this and very little steel be produce by port talbot be go into the defence industry but the defence industry be be supply with steel from an electric arc furnace by sheffield forgemasters there be absolutely no reason why an electric arc furnace build at port talbot use uk government support can not help support our defence industry in the year to come victim of crime what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on support victim of crime in wales have regular discussion with ministerial colleague on range of topic include on justice matter the government be commit to support victim by we will have quadruple funding in england and wales for victim and witness support service from level nine in crime go unsolved in wales in the last six month what do the minister say to the victim of the unsolved crime would point to the government record on crime last week office for national statistics crime survey show drop in all major crime type with an average reduction of about violent crime be down by neighbourhood crime be down by and theft be down by that be due in part to the fact that the government have meet their commitment to provide extra police officer my own force dyfed powys have now get an extra officer levelling up funding what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of level up funding on welsh community have regular discussion with cabinet colleague and delivery team in the department for levelling up housing and communities on the progress of level up fund project in wales look

congratulate my hon friend on be such champion of levelling up fund scheme in his constituency the levelling up fund have allow we to keep our post brexit promise to ensure that wales continue to be generously fund that be one of many such project such as the levelling up fund the freeport and the investment zone that be ensure that wales level up like the town and village represent coalfield community in wales be still bear the brunt of deindustrialisation be delighted that we will have debate tomorrow on miner and mining community and encourage welsh colleague to attend can the minister tell we what step he be take to ensure that levelling up funding in wales and across the coalfield in the uk be target at the most deprived leave behind area which have suffer most the hon gentleman be absolutely right to say we need to target the area most in need but that be exactly what this government have be do it be not just about level up fund we have have four growth deal across the length and breadth of wales three round of level up funding two investment zone two freeport an electrify rail line in north wales and an electrify arc furnace in south wales the reality be that while we be commit to level up the welsh labour government be commit to levy further taxis on people and business on wales before we come to prime minister question want to say that recent exchange have be lively to the point where it be become difficult for colleague to hear what be be say clearly and there have be an escalation in unhelpful exchange across the floor of the house from sedentary position and the attempt use of prop some of the language use in question have also fall short of the standard of good temper and moderation that should characterise the proceeding of this house know there be general election approach but urge hon member on both side of the house to exercise great self restraint in their choice of word and in their general behaviour both when they be ask question and when they be not prime minister the prime minister be ask engagements if he will list his official engagement for wednesday january on monday meet the family of grace kumar barnaby webber and ian

hon and learn lady constituent case as have say it be an awful miscarriage of justice and everyone affect deserve not only justice but compensation and answer will make sure we look into the precise detail of her constituent case surely there will be other like that and will make sure that the minister get back to she with all due haste sustainable aviation fuel play significant part in the

dream job to pay for it tory mp count the cost of tory chaos after year have we finally discover what they mean when they say we all in this together thank to the mortgage charter that the chancellor introduce last year million of mortgage holder across the country be benefit from mortgage support rather than take the approach that the right hon and learn gentleman just do it be important to focus on the practical support in place to help people who need it someone on typical mortgage be able to save hundred of pound thank to those reform recently we have see mortgage application at multi month high as result of confidence return if he really care about help people with the cost of living he would do more to celebrate and acknowledge the fact that thank to our plan million of work people will start to pay hundred of pound less in tax from this month payslip we all know that be not priority for he he say he want to back people on the cost of living but read that he have describe tax cut as salt the earth it seem that his shadow chancellor be equally confused in davos she say that she back tax cut but back here in westminster she call they scorch earth policy she obviously can not decide which wikipedia page to copy this week for every the prime minister say he be give people back he be take out of their back pocket through high tax he think they should be dance in the street and thank he there be people just like the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman come off fix rate mortgage and pay more each and every month because the conservatives crash the economy do the prime minister know how much their monthly repayment be go up by as say someone on typical mortgage of about with year leave be currently pay around as result of the ability to extend their mortgage term or switch to six month interest only mortgage someone on the average mortgage will be able to save hundred of pound again the right hon and learn gentleman say that he care about the cost of living but what would have the big impact on everyone cost of living be his idea to spend billion shadow treasury minister confirm just this morning that they remain committed to that but he have no plan to pay for that billion no plan at all that be typical labour economic they want to keep the spending but drop the payment plan at the weekend see the former labour leader the right hon and learn gentleman mentor who be clear that labour will make their sum add up with tax rise on people asset their home pension and business it be the same old labour party no plan and back to square one with high taxis the government have crash the economy mortgage be through the roof and they have double the debt and the prime minister think he can stand there and lecture other people about fiscal responsibility he do not answer the question hundred of thousand of people be come off fix rate mortgage and face huge mortgage increase and the prime minister will not even do they the courtesy of answer the question interruption no he do so will ask he again order be very clear at the beginning my constituent want to hear if yours do please leave do the prime minister have any idea how much mortgage be go up by this month for those come off fix rate mortgage again point the right hon and learn gentleman back to my previous answer everybody situation will be different someone on typical mortgage of around who be currently pay will be able to keep their mortgage payment essentially the same by use the facilitation the chancellor have put in place that be what we have do to help people again it be incumbent on the right hon and learn gentleman to explain to the british public how his policy of decarbonise the grid by will be fund he will not give the answer but helpfully the shadow energy secretary the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband pop up at the weekend in an interview in the sunday times and say that labour do not need plan to pay for it because in his word it will produce real saving and it make clear economic sense the leader of the opposition do not want to talk about it at all all these year later it be the same story the right hon member for doncaster north have carve promise in stone and everybody else just look away in embarrassment the prime minister just do not get it the government have crash the economy mortgage be skyrocket they be double the debt they say they be go to max out the government credit card at the next order think the chief whip be get very carry away he do not want to lead everybody for cup of tea do he come on the government have forfeit the right to lecture other about the economy somebody come off fix rate mortgage will be pay an average of more each and every month constant reminder that work people be pay the price for the damage the government have do to the economy this week meet an employee at iceland in warrington phil interruption order mr gibson the same voice keep appear again and it will not appear any more be just let you know now laugh at an iceland employee who be struggle with his mortgage shame phil tell his mortgage be go up by staggering month he do not want other average other people other story this be what be happen to he if the hon member for mid norfolk on can not afford this tory government how on earth can people like phil thank to the management of the economy phil and million of people like he be now ensure that inflation be less than half the rate that it be when we be talk year ago that be put more money in their pocket thank to this government phil and million of other worker not just at iceland but across the country be benefit this month in their pay packet from tax cut worth hundred of pound for someone on an average salary hope the right hon and learn gentleman explain to phil the cost of his policy do he explain how phil be go to have to pay for the right hon and learn gentleman billion green spending spree do he explain what it will cost phil in high taxis with more come out of his pay packet do he explain to phil that he would be well off stick with our plan rather than go back to square one with he invite the prime minister to get in touch with phil and explain to he how pay more in his mortgage be make he well off because that be not how he feel the prime minister be so out of touch it be unbelievable find hundred of pound extra per month may not seem like big deal to the prime minister but let tell he that most people do not have that sort of money knock around if that be not bad enough this week the prime minister tell every council in the country to put their council tax up by the maximum of that is tax rise now prime minister he say everything be fine and people be well off but when people see their mortgage go up their council tax go up and food price still go up who do he expect they to believe his boast or their bank account again be puzzle the right hon and learn gentleman resort here as always to the politic of envy be genuinely surprised that after recently and repeatedly attack not just but the government for lift the bonus cap the shadow chancellor have announce just today that she now support the government policy on the banker bonus cap do not know whether he mention that to phil when he be have his chat but be sure he can fill we in can tell he that trust and economic credibility come from stick to plan but it be become clear that we can not trust word he say when the shadow chancellor claim that they will not borrow much or raise phil taxis we now know that those promise be just not worth the wikipedia page they be copy from actually do not expect the prime minister to be laugh at phil do not expect order look make the statement very clear it be very serious that we make sure that people hear both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition it matter to the people who watch the proceeding of this chamber the behaviour that seem to be carry on be not good the prime minister just do not get how hard it be for million of people across the country like phil that be the primary problem they be struggle with their mortgage their bill and the spiral cost of living the prime minister response be never to take responsibility and never to show contrition or even any level of basic understanding he be so detached that he think he can paint world in which their problem simply do not exist the problem be that he can not even fool his own mps let alone anyone else the hon member for mid norfolk say he be exhausted and be look forward to new opportunity outside of parliament why do the prime minister not do he favour and call an election so that he and the whole country can move on whether it be phil or everyone else across the country the plan that we be put in place be work to help people and we be make progress just this week take action to stop child vape just this week ensure that people can visit their pharmacy to get the healthcare they need free up million of gp appointment and just this week million of work people start to see hundred of pound of tax cut deliver in their pay packet that be plan that be work all the right hon and learned gentleman be offer be billion of tax rise and that be the choice bright future with we or back to square one with they the prime minister like to attend live sport so wonder whether he will join in welcome the planning inspector decision to uphold rugby council rejection of an application for development at brandon stadium in my constituency to keep the door open for it to remain sporting venue so that future generation will enjoy the thrill and spill of motorcycle speedway and stock car join my hon friend in pay tribute and be proud of britain rich history in the automotive and motorsport sector the stadium he talk about be an historic motorsport venue while it have be shame to see it fall into disrepair hope that the decision he refer to will enable the possibility of both speedway and stock car race to return know that he will continue rightly to champion this cause call the snp leader when the tories scrap the cap on banker bonus in the autumn during cost of living crisis the labour party rightly oppose it yet here we be just three month later and the labour party support scrap the cap shameful be the prime minister comfort by the fact that he be now no long alone in this house on be completely out of touch with public opinion as say at the time we support the decision of the independent regulator because it be the right thing for financial stability and because we on this side of the house have set of conviction and we have plan and we stick to it but the hon gentleman be absolutely right to point out the flip flopping turn and no conviction of the party opposite of course scrap the cap on banker bonus be only make possible because of brexit what the westminster party be now tell the public be that it be ok for banker to have unlimited brexit bonus but the public who be sit at home and struggle to feed their family have to suck up and deal with additional food cost as result of brexit red tape that be the cost and that be the reality of break brexit britain be it not the case that the great achievement of this tory government be get the labour party to agree to that bleak future we be actually deliver benefit for people across scotland not least the new free trade deal that be open up market for scottish exporter freeport that be attract job and investment and the brexit pub guarantee that be cut the cost of pint in scottish pub the hon gentleman talk about the cost of living but what he could do to help the most be ensure that scotland be not the most highly tax part of the united kingdom and not just for high earner everyone earn

rethink its approach pharmacy first with permission shall make statement on the launch of our pharmacy first service pharmacy be at the centre of our community they be an accessible front door to our nhs for million of people alongside general practice optometry and dentistry pharmacy be one of the four pillar of primary care in england four in five people in england live within minute walk of community pharmacy pharmacy provide fast fair and simple access to care and advice for the kind of illness from which people suffer every day our constituent can now walk in off the high street whenever it suit they whether they be at home at work or visit somewhere our pharmacist be not only conveniently locate but highly skilled professional with year of training under their belt the number of register pharmacist in england have grow considerably under this conservative government up compare with none the less these skilled healthcare professional still represent rather untapped resource in our nhs so this government be bring forward reform that will make the most of their expertise give people up and down the country variety of quality care and wise advice quickly and easily save they trip to the gp free up appointment for patient who need gps the most and drive our plan to cut waiting list the benefit be clear that be why this government have consistently take the decision that allow community pharmacist to deliver more clinical service and supply more treatment whether that be other part of the nhs refer patient suffer from minor illness to community pharmacist for advice and the sale of over the counter medicine offer lifesave blood pressure check in pharmacy or make it easy for woman to access oral contraception in pharmacy be proud of everything that we have accomplish so far to unlock the full potential of our pharmacist we need to go far and fast that be why be delighted to inform the house today that we be launch the pharmacy first service personal priority of the prime minister who be himself the son of pharmacist this will give pharmacist the power to supply prescription only medication include antibiotic and antiviral for seven common condition sore throat ear ache infected insect bite impetigo shingle and minor urinary tract infection in woman more than community pharmacy have sign up over of pharmacy in england which be brilliant sign of their approval the next time that anyone be suffer from any of those seven condition for most people their first port of call will be quick trip or call to their pharmacist they will not need to see their gp first they will not need to spend time make an appointment and they can turn to their pharmacist whenever it suit they that benefit everyone involve people get the care they need fast gps can focus on more complicated case and pharmacist can make well use of their knowledge and skill this be common sense reform pharmacist see and advise people with these sort of condition every day but we have now enable they to provide prescription only medicine where clinically appropriate so that they can help people more easily all this will deliver result pharmacy first will make it easy for million of people to get the care they need on the high street and together with the expand blood pressure and contraception service it will free up as many as million gp appointment in turn reduce unnecessary trip to reduce the pressure on gps and drive forward our plan to cut waiting list for patient the investment that we be put into pharmacy first will also level up digital infrastructure in community pharmacie up and down the country streamline referral to and from gps give pharmacist well access to relevant information from patient gp record and allow they to share relevant information quickly in return pharmacy first be not just about deliver care fast but about make care fairer by drive down health inequality that be because there be double the number of pharmacy in the most deprived community in our country get the right care the right contraception and the right test will now be fast and simple for all those people in our more deprived community than it ever have be before thank to pharmacy first they will be able to take full advantage of their pharmacist expertise and use they to complement the care they receive from their gps and throughout the nhs pharmacy first be make possible only through close collaboration with community pharmacy england which thank for all the work it have do and will continue to do to support community pharmacy to gear up and deliver this new service for our nhs we on the conservative benches have clear plan for the nhs get patient the care they need fast make the system simple for staff and make it fair for everyone that be our plan and look forward to work with pharmacist up and down the country to deliver today announcement as we build bright future for family right across the country commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her statement let start by pay tribute to the many organisation that have be involve in prepare for this launch and the thousand of pharmacy across the country that have embrace this initiative labour have long be argue that pharmacist should play great role in the nhs so we support this move as the minister have say pharmacy already do far more than just dispense repeat prescription and sell shampoo they be medicine expert within the nhs they be highly train they be easily accessible right across the country and as we see during the pandemic they be highly trust part of their community but their skill and knowledge be often under utilise therefore bring more service to british high street for patient to get treat more quickly and conveniently be absolutely right it be why as we announce last week we want to bring nhs out patient appointment close to people through high street opticians too the minister be right to say that pharmacist can take pressure off gps however let we be clear this announcement will not make up for the pharmacy which have be close under the conservatives or the gps that have be cut since patient today be wait over month to see gp if they can get an appointment at all when labour be last in office people could get an appointment within hour that be the thing with this government they give with one hand and take with the other will the minister explain what have happen to the government pledge to deliver more gps this year and what she be do to support community pharmacy which be already face perfect storm of inflationary pressure for run cost recruitment challenge and an unstable medicine market the government press release issue today claim that patient in england will be able to get treatment for seven common condition at their high street pharmacy from today would like to dig down into whether that be actually the case healthwatch england have warn that it will take time for pharmacist to be train in order to provide the service that ministers have announce so can the minister tell we when she will be able to guarantee that the service advertise will actually be available let also ask about it integration to facilitate this roll out pharmacist be suppose to have access to gp connect so that detail of patient consultation would automatically be send to general practice through the clinical it system the government have have month to get that ready but from what be hear this morning it be still not live pharmacist be tell that they can access only summary of gp record that they have to use another system to input what they have prescribe and that they then have to download that and email it across to the gp that be cumbersome what estimate have the minister make of the time that will be waste at local level to address that issue and how long will it take before the system be ready finally what be the government plan in the long term to integrate the increase in independent prescriber who be be train as part of the long term workforce plan and do the minister agree with we that we should be accelerate the roll out of independent prescribing to establish community pharmacist prescribing service cover broad range of common condition that would support patient with chronic condition which be the big challenge face the nhs do the minister agree that community pharmacy will have an important role to play in support gps in the management of long term condition such as hypertension and asthma and in tackle the serious issue of over prescribing which be responsible for thousand of avoidable hospital admission every year we agree that patient should be able to go to their local pharmacy to receive some service that they currently get at gp surgery such as vaccination free of charge on the nhs allow patient to be see fast and free up gps to see more complex case by bring healthcare into the community patient will have great control the nhs should be as much neighbourhood health service as national health service with healthcare on the doorstep there when it be need and with labour it will be well the very first appointment under pharmacy first happen at this morning it be oh be it thank the secretary of state when will the service be available should think that many more be take place already be afraid that while welcome this the hon lady be be little pusillanimous with her praise lot of her suggestion as she will know be simply not true already well over new gps and ten of thousand of nurse be work in our nhs many thousand of additional practice staff be work in gp practice and as she will know our brilliant gps have make million more appointment available each year ahead of the target in our manifesto good on they they be do an amazing job and pharmacy first will ease the ever increase burden on they the hon lady talk about technology be pleased to tell she that ensure that the technology be in place be key in decide when we could go live there be very short window in which some system will have element of manual intervention but only for few week the whole system will be fully automate and will provide the ability to inquire into gp record and to swap advice which be important for pharmacist to deliver the excellent service that they be already deliver finally the hon lady will know that community pharmacist have for some time now be deliver blood pressure check which in some case be truly lifesaving this be amazing patient access and patient convenience the labour party should for once simply praise it and be glad that the government have stick to our plan and get on with it be so pleased to hear today announcement that we be deliver it be one of the key thing in our plan for patient that want to ensure happen in particular many member of this house current and past have have infection and as consequence of not deal with they have end up in hospital this be the sort of sensible approach that frankly meet some resistance during my time in the department with worry about over prescribing it be about treat pharmacist like proper professional and most important provide quick access to necessary care which patient will now properly enjoy may say huge thank you to my right hon friend for her contribution to kick this project off feel very fortunate to be at the dispatch box on the day we launch it because many other be involve in set it up she rightly highlight some of the problem with spot thing such as sepsis infection which pharmacist be train to spot they really can be the first line of defence be able to walk in off the high street to see pharmacist be incredibly valuable to we all as long stand supporter of the idea of pharmacy first welcome the right hon lady statement and the specific reform she have talk about introduce she will be aware however that pharmacist in my constituency and far afield be very concerned that they be unable to do the job that they be already expect to because of lack of capacity and problem in access certain drug that they need to prescribe can she indicate how the exist problem will be deal with so that they can do what be promise in pharmacy first be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his support for the programme there be around licensed medicine the vast majority of which be in good supply the department work very closely with the sector on find alternative and source supply of medicine and most of the time we be able to meet the demand occasionally there be challenge but that do not change in any way the ability of community pharmacist to be the expert medicine supplier that they be and to meet the need that member of the general public have for treatment and advice warmly welcome the statement this initiative have the potential to transform primary care and access to treatment but do the minister agree that to realise its full potential we need to invest in new technology she mention digitalisation to make sure that community pharmacy be set up to take advantage of these new opportunity we also need to invest in the pharmacy workforce as part of the government long term workforce plan so that those in alternative role within pharmacy such as pharmacy technician have the capacity to take the opportunity she have outline my hon friend be absolutely right invest in technology be vital but so be invest in the workforce we have see increase in the number of register community pharmacist since and we aim in our long term nhs workforce plan to increase that by further we have already increase the number of training place for both pharmacist and pharmacy technician too welcome pharmacy first which think be very good initiative in recent week we have see the closure of two pharmacy in my area on beverley road and chanterlands avenue be also tell by leader in the humber pharmacy community that our area have one of the large number of temporary closure because of problem access pharmacist will the minister look favourably therefore on my idea to attach school of pharmacy to hull york medical school we need school of dentistry too if we could have centre of excellence in the humber area it might solve some of our specific workforce problem be always happy to speak to colleague on both side of the house about their idea for new dental and pharmacy school it be an ongoing interest england be in fact bless with huge number of community pharmacy well over and four in five of we be able to walk to community pharmacy within minute the number of pharmacy in more deprive area be double the number in more well off area we be very well serve by our brilliant pharmacy and hope the pharmacy first programme will improve their footfall and their value in each of our community very much welcome this initiative to encourage our pharmacy to provide more frontline healthcare people need to know about this because they often do not think of go to the pharmacy what work be the government do in large population centre such as harwich and dovercourt which have over people but no out of hour pharmacy cover people have to make round trip of more than mile to collect prescription on sunday for example be the government do any work on pharmacy coverage for large population area my hon friend raise an important point pharmacist will keep their community pharmacy open for up to hour week in most case and up to hour in some case which mean there be weekend accessibility we keep this under review but the availability be very good the liberal democrats have long support call for pharmacy first and the national pharmacy association base in my st albans constituency have be call for it since at least this be welcome move but it be long overdue the minister will be aware that there have be almost permanent pharmacy closure since and the company chemists association now estimate that eight pharmacy week be close include one in my constituency what step be she take to make sure there be no more closure this week next week and every other week this year the hon lady might remember that the liberal democrats be in government for good part of that period she talk about pharmacy closure and we see pharmacy opening and closing there have be small number of net closure but we be very well serve across england and we keep close eye on that pharmacy first be new boost to community pharmacy across england congratulate my right hon friend on bring in this initiative have fantastic community pharmacy in south derbyshire although sadly when the boundary change come will lose hatton to derbyshire dales they be leader in their field and they be trust in their community this be brilliant initiative and can not thank my right hon friend enough thank my hon friend rise order that be perfect answer have to tell the house that we have lot of business to get through today and will therefore need short question and admirably short answer because otherwise not everyone who be stand will have chance to ask question do not agree with most of what the minister have say today we be all in favour of pharmacy but think this statement be distraction from the real problem in our health service our gp service and much else order will the hon gentleman please ask question have the minister look at the number of pharmacy that have close in the poor area of our country lastly what be she go to do about company like boot it have even close its local branch in westminster order because of his seniority have allow the hon gentleman little leeway one question one answer the more deprived part of england be much well serve by community pharmacy than well off area be we have amazing pharmacist in watford and have champion community pharmacy such as sigma which be fantastic local business can the minister provide an assurance that the general public will be make massively aware of this fantastic new service yes there will be significant communication package begin today the minister do not appear to be concern about the record number of community pharmacy closure under this conservative government why do she think it be happen there have be increase in register pharmacist since with plan to increase that number by in the next few year commend my right hon friend for her excellent statement but how will she tackle the issue of funding for prescription community pharmacy be struggle and she will understand that the nhs tariff do not pay they the full price of product will she look at that as she roll out the scheme the government currently contribute billion to community pharmacy quite apart from the million addition for pharmacy first we be about to start negotiation for the period the three pharmacy in shirley in my constituency have be there for decade they be very well know and very trust but they be all on the edge of have to close to stay open one pharmacist be use their own saving and not pay themselves wage welcome your announcement but would you read letter from they order there may have be lax obeying of the rule at other time but would the hon lady please refer to the minister as she not you forgive madam deputy speaker that be an error would the minister read that letter consider these issue and perhaps meet we to talk about it they be good people and we want to keep their pharmacy open be of course happy to read the letter but would say that pharmacy first offer significant new boost to community pharmacy my right hon friend will be pleased to hear that across cheshire and merseyside include my eddisbury constituency community pharmacy will be start the pharmacy first initiative today particularly in rural area pharmacy be lifeline for many people can she reassure patient of the clinical competence of pharmacist to make prescription and can she reassure pharmacist on the issue of clinical liability can assure my hon friend that pharmacist be highly skilled and well train than ever before in this country they be fully equip to meet the demand of their new prescribing role welcome the pharmacy first initiative its roll out be long overdue but what expectation be we create in the mind of patient attend pharmacy will pharmacist be train in deny medication to people who turn up expect to be give prescription of some sort clearly the initiative will encourage more people to present in order to get medication when it may not be necessary the hon gentleman raise good point of course pharmacist will be prescribe for seven common condition plenty of referral will be make to gps and from gps to pharmacist to give patient the accessibility and the appropriate level of assessment for their need pharmacy in horsham have ask for such scheme so they will very much welcome it as do however as the minister be aware from our one on one discussion for which be grateful there be currently issue of access to pharmacy in horsham will she ensure that the sector be appropriately resource and have the right training in order to ensure that the scheme be the great success that it deserve to be absolutely and be always happy to discuss that far with my right hon friend northern ireland minor ailment scheme and this pharmacy first initiative be acknowledgment that gps can spend up to of their work day on minor ailment but the scale in northern ireland be different from what have be propose for england be there capacity for uk wide roll out of pharmacy first to take pressure off our gp service if there be that would be the right thing to do seriously look forward to the re establishment of the stormont assembly so that it will be possible for northern ireland to implement such scheme itself warmly welcome the statement have be strong champion of pharmacy in my constituency we be experience challenge however when the like of boots withdraw their service it be difficult to transfer or apply for licence despite the fact that we have number of keen applicant who want to provide important pharmacy service what more can the government do to speed up and make the licensing application procedure smoother and well would love to hear more about that from my right hon and learn friend will be happy to look into it in recent month boots have close two of three pharmacy in the hampton area of my constituency that have leave hampton north which be one of the most deprived ward in the london borough of richmond upon thames without single pharmacy so elderly resident and those with long term condition have to walk for lot long than minute to access pharmacy local gps tell that it be just not viable to set up community pharmacy facility will the government review the pressure on community pharmacy and consider the community pharmacy contractual framework so that we can make this initiative work and take the pressure off gps as have already mention there be many community pharmacy start up all the time as well as close down the hon lady will appreciate that the pharmacy first initiative be real boost to community pharmacy be happy to discuss it with she but would imagine that there will be the capability to open new community pharmacy in her area congratulate my right hon friend and her front bench colleague on roll out this initiative the isle of portland have two pharmacy both run by boot but one be now shut can meet my right hon friend and front bench colleague to discuss how we can ensure that deprive area such as portland retain the pharmacy that they desperately need would be very happy to meet my hon friend with so many of my constituent wait long time to see gps any boost to primary care capacity must be welcome so thank the minister for today announcement the gps and pharmacy staff meet raise concern about recruitment to open role what assurance can the minister offer that this will not be another policy like the childcare announcement that lack the workforce or sectoral strategy to really gain the full benefit as the hon gentleman will know our nhs long term workforce plan intend to increase by the number of register pharmacist that work be under way and include increase the number of pharmacy technician it be great that people will be able to go to the pharmacy for their prescription as well as for the product that they need without the need to visit gp chelmsford have some great community pharmacy but boot be close three branch will my right hon friend meet to discuss how we can ensure that the people of chelmsford will be able to get to pharmacy in order for the initiative to work would be very happy to meet my right hon friend the community pharmacy in wem in my constituency have struggle to find full time pharmacist rely instead on locum that mean that opening time be erratic people can not rely on the service and the pharmacy be loss making because locum be so expensive how will the minister help pharmacy in rural area to recruit the full time pharmacist and reduce their reliance on locum the hon lady will be aware that although few be own by gp practice community pharmacy be usually private business we be train the registered community pharmacist that we need obviously it would be for that local area to put in place its own recruitment policy but would be happy to meet she to discuss that far warmly welcome my right hon friend statement and put on the record my thank to all the pharmacist who work in my constituency the geography of my constituency can often mean that someone near pharmacy be about mile and half away across the water so they end up drive mile around to get to it believe that the mapping need to change will she meet to discuss it be always happy to meet my hon friend just to let she know pharmacy in cornwall be sign up to pharmacy first this brilliant announcement have the potential to free up many thousand of gp place in area such as peterborough but the initiative will be the success that we need it to be only if more people know about my right hon friend touch on an awareness campaign but what effort will she make to ensure that it reach difficult to reach community such as those for whom english be an additional language there will be big communication plan which be happy to share with my hon friend well over community pharmacy in his area have sign up to pharmacy first which be brilliant news it be incumbent on we all and the purpose of the statement to ensure that our constituent know about this excellent new service although my right hon friend and share common scepticism of the sclerotic state of the european union there be lesson to be learn from europe be glad to see that like france we be now respect community pharmacy however have one specific question in her statement she say that one thing on which the pharmacy can act be female urinary tract infection why not male wish my hon friend happy brexit day will have to come back to he on that issue the point be that the service be limit to minor urinary tract infection that might be why it do not include man but will certainly get back to he on that point and many if not all of my constituent very warmly welcome the statement on integration with other nhs access service if an individual be to dial nhs with one of the condition mention in the statement would they be divert to pharmacy or to gp first to pharmacy nhs gps and urgent and emergency care can all refer to pharmacist for those particular common condition join other in welcome the new scheme will my right hon friend ensure as part of the communication that the nhs website be update to show which pharmacy have sign up to pharmacy first and will she continue to encourage those that have not yet sign up to do so what be brilliant be that over of all community pharmacy have sign up include in my hon friend area key to the service success will be pharmacy actually offer it when patient turn up do my right hon friend know how many individual pharmacist have be train to provide the service and be there way of gathering and publish datum on when pharmacy will offer the service so that patient will not have frustrated journey and we can see where the gap be as say more than of all community pharmacy have sign up to the service and all their pharmacist have be train in how to deliver it as someone who have champion the role of community pharmacy throughout my time in this house warmly welcome today statement be particularly delighted that we be able to host one of the pilot scheme in cornwall which be hugely successful result in consultation that take appointment away from gps and appearance will the minister join in thank all the pharmacy in cornwall that take part in that pilot which be so successful absolutely it be only by try these thing that we can see how successful they can be and do believe this service be go to radically improve patient access to care northern ireland executive formation with permission will make statement on northern ireland executive formation this saturday would mark two year without fully function devolve government in northern ireland that be two year without locally elect ministers able to take important decision on northern ireland school and hospital and the broad economy and above all it be two year in which northern ireland have be hold back from achieve the massive potential of this unique part of the united kingdom it be nearly two year ago that the then first minister resign over the old northern ireland protocol the government recognise that the protocol do not deliver to the people of northern ireland the same freedom that leave the european union deliver for the rest of the united kingdom as the party of the union this conservative government have seek to address those concern by replace the protocol with the windsor framework maintain that the windsor framework be and be good deal for northern ireland that address the issue around the old protocol and set out new way forward however it alone do not prove sufficient to allow the devolved institution to function with the cross community support that be such an essential bedrock of the belfast good friday agreement as such for the past few month my team and have be hold discussion with the northern ireland political party on how we could see the return of devolved institution those discussion have be long and necessarily tough but that be testament to the patience of all northern ireland political leader who as have see at first hand work tirelessly to make sure that northern ireland be the most prosperous and safe society it can be one of the people have be talk to most be the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson it have be pleasure to work with he on these matter and it be also pleasure to confirm recently that the government will support his bill that seek to create dedicated route for eligible irish national who wish to apply for british citizenship if pass that legislation would support the close historical and geographical tie between ireland and the uk and commend he on championing that cause be also pleased to be able to outline today the package of measure we be announce which have four key element first it far protect northern ireland place in the united kingdom by demonstrate our commitment to restore power sharing so that it have the broad support from across the community in northern ireland know that be not alone in believe firmly that the long term interest of the union be serve by persuade those who might not vote for unionist party or even think of themselves as unionists that northern ireland within the united kingdom offer the good solution for they and their child have always believe that make northern ireland work indeed make northern ireland thrive be the sure way to safeguard the union and commend all unionists on take bold step to make that case for the union too we will also legislate to reaffirm northern ireland constitutional status include as reflect in the act of union we will also recognise in domestic law that

which will be at the centre of how we attract new inward investment to realise the huge potential that northern ireland present for job and the economy both here in the uk and across the wide world it

firmly of the view that northern ireland be govern well when it be govern locally and we welcome the publication of the command paper would like to take this opportunity to recognise the distance that have be travel by all party in get to this point but we be bring to this point by failure of politic around the manner in which the uk choose to leave the european union now that the politic have move on it be time for the politician in northern ireland to step up and we wish the mla well in that endeavour and look forward to see the first minister and the deputy first minister take office in what

the union that northern ireland have for some time have the offer of status in its access to the uk market and to the european market that other part of the union be now deprive of be sure that voter

it in the future everyone recognise that it be recognise in the windsor framework and as he will see in various choice we be make in the command paper on the fiscal framework very much hope that the incoming northern ireland executive and ministers responsible will work with his majesty treasury in great detail to make sure that we get that absolutely right have never conduct negotiation with his majesty treasury in that sort of way but imagine that it have quite tight pocket be very difficult to get hold of and probably would not want ongoing commentary however be sure that it will make the

but we have remove all check within the uk internal market system save for those ordinarily require for deal with criminality and the prevention of smuggling we be tell that there would be no legal

establish and give the process that need to flow would be very grateful if he could indicate that tomorrow subject to what the leader of the house do we will see the introduction and passage of the legislation that be so crucial to this programme thank the hon gentleman for that as mention in my statement he have be integral to what have be happen over the past few week and month really do enjoy work with he and be look forward to do so in the future he mention host of thing he be right to say that the command paper be clear we will provide clear legal direction to the department of agriculture environment and rural affairs and other uk government authority to eliminate any physical check when good move within the uk internal market system save for those check require as part of manage the risk of criminality abuse of the scheme smuggling and disease the hon gentleman know more than anyone that the deal be about safeguard northern ireland place in the union we have set out what that involve it include new measure in domestic legislation to affirm unfettered access and northern ireland constitutional position as well as new structure and step to ensure that the full benefit of the windsor framework be feel by people and business as be show by the draft tariff text that he mention we can continue to show the joint solution that the uk and eu can deliver under the windsor framework he ask very specific question about the timetable be committed to the timetable as be the government everybody in this house should know that in all transparency it be unbelievably important that with the leave of the house we get the business change so that we can debate those two statutory instrument and they can be pass they be fundamental part of the timetable that lead to stormont return welcome the progress make towards the restoration of power sharing and thank the secretary of state and the dup for their dedicated work on that be sure there will be much to welcome in the paper publish today which we will need to scrutinise carefully in the or so hour before we be ask to vote on they however one thing that we know that they do not contain be removal of northern ireland from single market legislation will the secretary of state ensure that the government commit to continue the dialogue with the eu so that we can amend the windsor framework and restore democratic control over law making in every part of our united kingdom thank my right hon friend one of the long serve former secretaries of state in this house for her comment and question she be absolutely right in all she say the command paper which do hope people will have the opportunity to read before tomorrow contain quite an amount of detail on the deal it be comprehensive deal the statutory instrument tomorrow be just two small part of much wide package of item in the deal this be all outline and detail in the command paper to answer my right hon friend question she will also see an important change that we intend to make to section of the european union withdrawal act it now have powerful democratic safeguard in the stormont brake which the new assembly will have immediately at its fingertip as the member behind know be marry in county armagh at the very height of the trouble and hear the explosion and see the huge bomb damage tragically my wife family lose number of friend in the trouble serve for year in the scottish parliament so have some knowledge of devolution may therefore ask the secretary of state to make possible the maximum liaison between restore stormont godspeed to that and devolve institution such as the scottish parliament so that the maximum benefit can be draw from responsible working devolution thank the hon gentleman for his question he be absolutely right know of his history and the story about his wife which he have mention to number of time thank he for his interest in all thing northern ireland and all thing union in fact there be body the british irish council that do exactly what he suggest at the high level hopefully at the next meeting of the british irish council the first minister and deputy first minister of northern ireland will attend with representative of all the other devolve administrations of the united kingdom the propose legislation be of great constitutional significance yet it be merely statutory instrument and not an act of parliament what restriction on its lawmaking have the eu agree over the single market in northern ireland what democratic improvement be be make to the stormont brake in northern ireland to ensure divergence and to enable the united kingdom government to remove or veto the imposition of eu law thank my hon friend for his question he and have have number of discussion over the year on these sort of matter and his question be very wise one as mention we be amend section of the european union withdrawal act so there be now powerful democratic safeguard on the flow of eu law which new assembly will have immediately at its fingertip thank my hon friend because know about the work that he do to ensure that section be include in the act hope he recognise that we be add northern ireland place in the united kingdom which be strong addition to section of the european union withdrawal act indeed his original clause have be big part of the solution to this conundrum and be truly grateful to he for it despite the gain make by my party leader and deputy party leader in these negotiation the fact remain that there be still eu man border post be build in northern ireland which will create border within our own country when the northern ireland assembly sit ministers and assembly members will be expect by law to adhere to and implement law that be make in brussels which they will have no say over no ability to amend and no ability to stop that be result of this spineless weak kneed and brexit betray government refuse to take on the eu and its interference in northern ireland the government have admit that there will be divergence in the future on page of the command paper there be an indication that there will be legal requirement to assess whether new legislation impact on trade between northern ireland and gb if it do ministers have to make statement we have have the minister of state the right hon member for wycombe mr baker say only this week that that do not mean that the uk government can not introduce law that diverge from the eu law that apply in northern ireland which be it be northern ireland go to find that it have the ability to stay tie to the united kingdom or will the government happily proceed to change law here in westminster regardless of the impact it have on northern ireland thank the right hon gentleman for his question but some of the point he make be actually incorrect in the northern ireland protocol bill we say that there would be check on good go into the eu single market think that every piece of legislation we have propose in this place have say that but it will be uk folk operate the uk internal market scheme today on the fourth anniversary of our leave the european union can tell he that the agree package of measure will not change the freedom and power we have secure through brexit or the windsor framework it will not reduce our ability to diverge nor our commitment to do so should it be in the interest of the united kingdom the right hon gentleman refer to clause in one of the statutory instrument whole swathe of thing happen behind the scene before bill be bring before this house one of they which the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson have complain to about before be something we call the parliamentary business and legislation committee or pbl we do star chamber of bills and the secretaries of state for scotland northern ireland and wales attend to state whether there be any adverse effect of the legislation be moot what the right hon gentleman rightly ask for be transparency and the publication of write ministerial statement when there be the possibility of significant adverse effect on gb ni trade publish write ministerial statement be not in any way what he say it be may congratulate my right hon friend and the dup clearly this be still highly emotive issue and understandably so because when we leave the eu the house and the country be promise that we would leave as united kingdom northern ireland be part of the united kingdom but as we have hear it will still be subject to eu law so that axe be still grind away and we must get rid of it what be unhelpful be sinn féin whisper about unification at this highly emotive time can my right hon friend tell the house and this country that northern ireland will always be part of the united kingdom we be strong together have to tread slightly more carefully on that particular issue because as secretary of state be responsible for make an independent assessment of the condition that might lead to the border poll to which my hon friend allude have to be very careful but be comfortable suggest that certainly in my lifetime northern ireland will be strong and wonderfully prosperous part of the united kingdom however it be very important to outline the part of the belfast good friday agreement that allow for all these thing to happen and any change would absolutely depend on the consent of both community at the time certainly do not think anybody judge that to be in place at this point it be important to point out that the people of ireland north and south will decide the constitutional future of ireland nobody else this be very good day for the people of northern ireland and be very glad to see it we be about to see something very significant we will have the first ever nationalist first minister and the first ever nationalist leader of the opposition and wish they well in order to properly maintain this progress and make the most of it will the secretary of state convene process with all the political party and the irish government to look at how we can reform the institution of the good friday agreement to make sure that no one party can ever pull they down again thank the hon gentleman for welcome the proposal he mention at the very beginning of his question that the belfast good friday agreement rely on the consent of both community and then suggest reform which certainly do not have the consent of one of they however understand the point he make when people have ask about future reform of the institution have always say that this be conversation that should be start within stormont and by the people of northern ireland and their elect representative the thing hope for be not that particular conversation it be for stormont to be return so that elect folk from northern ireland can govern for the people of northern ireland it be absolutely vital that the democratic institution and lawmaking power be return to the elect politician in northern ireland and today be clearly very historic and symbolic at the same time however we know that northern ireland economic lifeblood be link to the rest of gb and concur with the rest of my colleague who have speak on this issue it be vital that we ensure not only that there be the ability to diverge and have the freedom to secure northern ireland economic lifeblood but that the prosperity of northern ireland remain may ask the secretary of state to ensure that we have the full ability to do that and that it will be back up by this government in westminster my right hon friend be absolutely right be delighted to give she the assurance she seek because this announcement will reduce neither our ability to diverge nor our commitment to do so should that be in the interest of the united kingdom many of we welcome this day and hope that the restoration of stormont be possible if the government be capable of remove trade barrier with the european union for the constituent of belfast many of my constituent would like to see they do the same for they may press the secretary of state on what he say about amend section of the european union withdrawal act because he will know that be the foundation of the practical application of the belfast good friday agreement that many of we hold dear his command paper talk about the pipeline of eu law can he clarify for the avoidance of doubt that any amendment he make will not see any regression at all in the right uphold in that document and in particular the right afford to every single member of the community in northern ireland in the wording of the good friday agreement and under the european convention on human right yes absolutely can may thank my right hon friend for his statement and the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson for his important endorsement which be encouraging may ask my right hon friend about paragraph of the command paper can he give an example of the circumstance in which minister might say that there would be an effect on the internal market and what that might restrict in practice off the top of my head can not give an example because have not yet need to do that in the pbl parliamentary business and legislation committee as have state the practical effect be one of transparency be aware that there be many select committee chairs in this place we want to ensure that when bill potentially have substantial adverse effect on gb ni trade and we be make those decision we be transparent about it and we tell people about it the good way to do that be to inform this house through write ministerial statement thank the secretary of state for his statement remind he that we have be press the government for action rather than word for more than two year but we welcome the fact that action have be take both on trading and the constitutional position do he agree that subsequent to the next few day we need to continue to work to close the narrow gap that remain we have make significant and substantial progress towards what we ask the government to do will he also indicate to the wide community in northern ireland that even when someone get large number of vote such as sinn féin if they have mantra that their day will come it will also go with less fanfare very much agree with the hon gentleman see all politic as process actually all politic be an evolution in the windsor framework there be provision for when matter be discuss about northern ireland in the joint committee the body that look at the eu uk relationship legislation and its effect that the first minister and deputy first minister can attend we be not only move on through stormont return but we be ensure that northern ireland voice be hear and that that process can continue give everything that the secretary of state have say can he assure the house that article of the act of union which guarantee that everybody within that union shall not be disadvantage in any way particularly with reference to trade be still in place and will remain so point my hon friend to the very large section and annex in the command paper on the act of union know my colleague the shadow secretary of state dig out the act of union to read they in relation to this business there be many bit of the act of union that we would not really want to have now because they introduce tariff of their own but ask my hon friend to look at the annex in the command paper where we go into great detail on exactly the answer he want we thank the secretary of state for his very welcome statement and we take the opportunity to congratulate michelle on become the first minister and all the other party that have manage to bring this agreement about do he think that this agreement will lead to an increase in all ireland institution and their effectiveness in culture tourism transport health and so on and do he agree with the point make by the hon member for foyle colum eastwood that ultimately it be for the people of ireland to decide their long term future not anyone else on the second point it be for the people of ireland and northern ireland to decide their future in that particular matter remind the right hon gentleman that there be little way to go in this process before we have the first minister and deputy first minister sit and this be an important part of that timetable but we welcome that happen he ask about all ireland institution this agreement mean that those institution set up by the belfast good friday agreement such as the north south ministerial council can function correctly and it also set up new east west body to ensure that northern ireland place in the united kingdom be equally recognise and make strong may join the shadow secretary of state in hugely welcome this great achievement by the secretary of state by the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson and by all the other party leader with whom he successfully agree to re establish devolved government at stormont as the son of northern ireland unionist family believe it will only be good for the stability and prosperity of northern ireland and the united kingdom can my right hon friend confirm when the internal market levy and the change to tariff on good from country with which the uk have free trade agreement will come into place thank my hon friend for his kind word the factually correct answer be probably that those measure will come into place when the legislation be pass through this place the secretary of state know that be just too long to wait for veterinary medicine issue to be resolve in northern ireland that grace period be totally unacceptable he know it will decimate veterinary practice affect farm viability and accord to the british veterinary association have detrimental impact on public health in paragraph of this command paper the secretary of state indicate that he will set up veterinary medicine working group welcome that but will he confirm that if speedy solution be not bring forward by the spring he will table legislation in this house to unilaterally deal with this matter once and for all the hon gentleman be right think it be paragraph to in the command paper that detail the issue he have rightly raise in this place with privately and in meeting with my official it be probably fair to say that he be the genesis of the veterinary medicine work group idea in paragraph that group will receive expert opinion and that be vital part of the solution to this problem my intention be to listen carefully to the group recommendation because it will have the expert in this matter at that point he and can have the next bit of conversation although hope that will not need to be the case because would like to think we can pursue solution through technical discussion with the european union but let we see echo the comment of many colleague across the house in welcome the progress make on this matter through the secretary of state thank the many people involve for the effort they have put in we have two draft statutory instrument before we amend two set of primary legislation with the word constitutional law in one of they the question ask during this statement hint at the breadth and depth of the issue that such instrument raise it seem slightly incongruous that they be come to this place last even though they be the first concern of this house do my right hon friend agree that hon member should have time to read digest and debate the instrument can he explain why the current proposal be for exactly that to be do in just hour and with short debate thank my hon friend for his question know that he have talk to my minister of state on these matter actually our standing orders state the debating time for these thing the house be an interesting being and would not want to get in the way of its standing orders secondly as try to underline in previous answer timetable have be agree with the democratic unionist party which the government be commit to and if we fulfil it that will lead to the restoration of stormont the house be full of agile and able member of parliament who be amazingly good at scrutiny and know that they can do that very very well in the time provide thank the secretary of state for his statement and thank my party leader and deputy leader for the many gain in the command paper however our leader say that there remain work to do will the secretary of state therefore confirm whether northern ireland still remain under the eu single market law for the production of food and agrifood do the eu custom code still apply in northern ireland do he accept that such situation be not compatible with uk sovereignty and northern ireland place as full part of the united kingdom in accept that would he say that more work need do on this will he far outline what assurance he have have from the eu that the rule govern the new internal market system be acceptable to it thank the hon lady for her question may recommend that she re read the windsor framework and indeed the command paper applaud the secretary of state the minister of state and the wide northern ireland team know have see this up close and personal how passionate and dedicated they be on this issue the people of northern ireland will ultimately be the winner when it come to decision be make locally close to they as member of parliament from the new intake think it be great shame that we have often feel at loggerhead with democratic unionist party member ultimately share huge amount of their value and absolutely appreciate their passion and how closely they cling to their identity share that passion will the secretary of state ensure that this mark new chapter when we can work more collaboratively to promote the place of northern ireland within our union which we all love thank my hon friend know that he be passionate about northern ireland indeed see his passion when host he and he visit and look around northern ireland the answer to his question be yes yes we need to move forward yes we need to work with the democratic unionists yes we need positive way forward for unionism so that northern ireland can forever stay part of our united kingdom be hopeful that northern ireland be now in well place have always understand that in the context of hard brexit northern ireland would require some special arrangement my party have always be open to maximise flexibility provide that those be do in legal way and that we protect our dual market access on the financial package very much welcome the billion for northern ireland which reflect cross party effort will the secretary of state acknowledge that there be need for further discussion to happen potentially in the next parliament on long term review of northern ireland fiscal framework and fiscal floor on reform will he recognise that build on precedent the uk government must lead that process if we be talk about safeguard the union we also have to talk about safeguard the assembly and the executive thank the hon gentleman for that question which have be raise with for month if not since become secretary of state by the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson who be rather keen on make sure that we have long term agreement and process in this space really look forward to work with ministers in reform executive on exactly that in the light of the answer the secretary of state give to my hon friend the member for upper bann carla lockhart or the lack of an answer would like to reiterate that point as well as ask about implementation and how northern ireland be affect by not get access to duty free every other airport in the united kingdom have access to duty free yet those fly from northern ireland to any part of europe can not avail themselves of duty free it be the only airport on these island where that can not be do that be one area where the single market be affect we we be still part of that single market and from what see in the command paper we will continue to be as consequence in our energy market in northern ireland would like an answer on this we

fair to say that northern ireland be part of single energy market across the island of ireland well before we leave the european union and that there have always be interaction on that basis the answer to his question be contain in the command paper there be whole host of thing to say but will just make the point about the difference for northern ireland it do have access to the eu single

freedom of movement service rule environmental rule labour rule or procurement rule neither be it subject to the european medicines agency the common agricultural policy or the common fishery policy northern ireland have unique circumstance because of its geographic location everybody recognise that we want it to thrive in our union and with the command paper that direction of travel be set

agenda which we be talk to official about to try accommodate tomorrow hope to update the house on that later be it not fact that now this government have the assembly on the fishing hook they really do not care one iota about scrutiny of the bait be use to get the assembly back have introduce the command paper to the house today and have get commitment to the assembly suggest that this government do not give two hoot about whether there be sufficient time to see whether the promise make will be fulfil have great respect for the right hon gentleman but think he be wrong in that assertion there will be many strong feeling on all side of the house about various aspect of the position we have get to but the comment make from all side of the house during the secretary of state statement indicate that this be an important step forward and be to be welcome inevitably it be compromise people have have to compromise to get here and applaud they for do that there will be future debate on these matter my colleague on the front bench will be very happy to answer any point that the right hon gentleman raise my right hon friend the minister of state northern ireland office be an example of conviction passion and determination on the issue that the hon gentleman care deeply about point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker at the start of prime minister question the speaker remind the house about the use of language the debate on gaza be get far more emotive and the language use have be questionable in one or two case as be sure you be aware madam deputy speaker one of the snp members ask question about gaza and after the question be answer member of the snp can not identify they accuse the prime minister of be pontius pilate which we on these benches hear very clearly that kind of language be extremely unpleasant because as you know madam deputy speaker pontius pilate wash his hand and hand jesus over to murderous death that be not what the prime minister be do he have an impeccable record on this topic and be lead with great courage and conviction in war in gaza that is indeed highly emotive far to that point of order madam deputy speaker just for the record seek your guidance on how to make it very clear that it be not member of the snp who say any such thing can be absolutely certain about that think member might want to be very clear about which party be say thing before make such accusation how can put that on the record madam deputy speaker thank the hon gentleman will come to the other point of order in moment appreciate the point of order make by the hon member for south dorset richard drax can say only this mr speaker strive throughout prime minister question to keep order in this house but it have become fashionable to make unnecessary noise during the half hour when the prime minister and the leader of the opposition be on the front benches generally this house be well behave as it be at the moment and take its duty responsibility and public image seriously it be very sad if somebody do make the comment that the hon member for south dorset have describe take the point make by the hon member for midlothian owen thompson that if remark be make about pontius pilate it be not make by an snp member but actually as far as the chair be concern do not care who make such remark it be wrong to try to whip up bad feeling in this house or anywhere else about the tragedy unfolding in israel and palestine urge all hon member who have different point of view on this emotive subject to be very careful about what they say in public and in private but especially in this chamber far to that point of order madam deputy speaker would like to think be an honourable gentleman and if indeed get it wrong withdraw the point that the comment be make by an snp member it come from that part of the house but if it be not an snp member withdraw that point be grateful to the hon gentleman for withdraw that accusation because it let we at least take that part out of this specific issue it may be that somebody make that comment but really do not care what they say or how they say it they should not be say anything at all while seat when someone else be ask question or the prime minister be answer it everyone in this house ought to bear in mind that what be say and do in here have much wide audience and we ought to be set an example of be reasonable and careful in the way that we use word and phrase and never be inflammatory on point of order madam deputy speaker my point of order also relate to israel and gaza itv news recently broadcast video show the killing of an unarmed civilian in gaza who be wave white flag the international symbol of peace it be not the first time unarmed people have be kill in gaza while raise white flag in fact three israeli hostage be brutally kill while topless and wave white flag this be deeply concern to as be sure it be to many people in this house an israel defence forces commander have indicate that the idf be responsible say there be mistake it be war this incident could potentially constitute war crime how can we ensure that the government come to this house to assure we that this incident will be properly investigate and that uk supply weapon be not use and to set out the step be take to ensure that israel follow the ruling from the international court of justice have listen carefully to the hon lady and the point she make be not point of order for the chair not at all she be make very serious point about tragic incident among many thousand of tragic incident that have occur over the past few month but it be not point of order for the chair the hon lady be raise point that she want to raise with ministers the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell be recently at the dispatch box make statement on gaza and anticipate it be very likely that foreign office minister or minister from the ministry of defence will be here again within few day to make further statement if not opposition front benchers and other have be most assiduous in ask urgent question to ensure that minister come to the house to answer these important question the hon lady be not ask question that can deal with from the chair she be ask question that she want to ask of minister if she want to ask question of minister there be various way she can do that she can put down an urgent question she can ask for an adjournment debate she can speak to member on her own front bench about have an extended debate in opposition time will not list they all there be many many way in which the hon lady can do that but can not answer her question from the chair it be not point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker have on two previous occasion ask the leader of the house to correct the record after she tell this house on january that people in england pay low tax than people in scotland and we have manage balanced report january vol at prime minister question today the prime minister incorrectly refer to people in scotland pay high taxis than people in england have notify the prime minister that would be refer to he the house of commons library via the office for budget responsibility have confirm that the statement make by the leader of the house and the prime minister be both untrue the majority of people in scotland pay low taxis include council tax than people in england no uk government have deliver balanced budget since and the current uk government pay the equivalent of million day in debt interest while the scottish government must by law balance their budget every year give that hon member must correct inadvertent error at the early opportunity madam deputy speaker seek your guidance and advice as to how to ensure that the leader of the house and the prime minister do indeed correct the record and your advice as to what measure can be take if hon member repeat factually incorrect information in this place and appear to order thank the hon lady once again appreciate that member want to use the opportunity of point of order to make the point that they want to make but there be big difference do not shout while be speak there be difference between point of order on procedure in this house and matter of opinion in the interpretation of statistic there be will the hon lady just be quiet and allow to answer her question there be inevitably difference of opinion on the interpretation of statistic there be also as the hon lady say fact as oppose to opinion if fact be state wrongly in this house they should be correct however it be not for the chair to make judgment as to who correctly interpret the fact put before the house that be why we have debate and question we be not mean to come here and all agree with one another that be why we have this chamber where proper debate can take place if the hon lady be say that fact be state wrongly be quite sure that minister will take the first opportunity to correct those fact think perhaps the leader of the house will take that opportunity right now far to that point of order madam deputy speaker would be very happy to this be obviously matter of great concern and urgency to the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson she would normally raise it at business question tomorrow be quite sure this have nothing to do with the fact that the former first minister be in front of the covid inquiry today interruption there be nothing like good order what on earth do you think you be do the hon lady raise point the leader of the house be answer an aspect of that point it be not moment when shouting should occur to get to the substance of the point understand that the hon lady mention house of commons library paper that she be rely on to do this that particular library paper be use figure from the scottish budget in which be out of date as she will know income tax out turn be not go to be report for many more month so she can not make that assertion what have do in my response at business question to detailed point on taxation be to give the house direct salary level and the taxis that people be pay north and south of the border whatever our view and political disagreement take my responsibility to this house extremely seriously let make it clear once again that there be difference between point of order on procedure and matter for debate that be why we have debate be quite sure that the hon member for north ayrshire and arran will raise her point in debate on many occasion over the next few week as indeed will the hon member for brent central dawn butler who make the previous point of order that be what debate be for and it be not for the chair to make those decision police declaration motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require police officer and certain employee of police force to declare membership of or affiliation to certain type of society and organisation to require such declaration to be accompany by statement relate to that membership and for connected purpose secret closed or private society have often be the subject of ridicule from monty python to the simpsons these organisation have be see as silly strange and perhaps old fashioned and even today we hear reference to the funny handshake club however look beyond the parody and we find network of those with power and authority club of like minded individual that look out for their own we know that these network exist in area of public life here in the uk our police model rely on public trust and consent at the heart of the peelian principle of policing be the idea that public consent be maintain by apply the law fairly and impartially the college of policing code of ethic state that to demonstrate that they be apply the law fairly police force should operate with transparency the casey report into culture at the metropolitan police state the check and balance provide by robust scrutiny governance and accountability be vital for public body perhaps especially the police with their duty towards and power over the public the independent office for police conduct report into public perception of the police identify increase transparency as key measure the police could take to improve confidence in policing with those word in mind be seek to bring forward bill that at its heart provide more transparency to the public the outcome of the bill would be to have public register of association for all officer and civilian work for the police that be not particularly new idea in this house in the home affairs committee publish its report freemasonry in the police and the judiciary which conclude we recommend that police officer magistrate judge and crown prosecutor should be require to register membership of any secret society and that the record should be publicly available in february the home office accept that recommendation state that all new appointment shall have as condition of appointment requirement to declare membership of the freemasons the influence of freemasonry on the police have often be discuss over the decade suggestion of influence in high profile case of police corruption and mismanagement have be shoot down due to lack of evidence be not here to throw accusation but the continuous mention of freemasonry raise many eyebrow even in this house have use freemasonry as an example but the bill do not only apply to that particular society after all old boy club have always exist within the police and they can take many shape the casey report into the culture at the metropolitan police highlight the use of whatsapp group closed group of like minded individual look out for their own sound familiar policing culture have rightly be under heavy scrutiny in recent year allegation of misogyny racism and homophobia have stick in the public conscience alongside claim of corruption and collusion the government along with police body have commit to reform and number of inquiry and review have take place if we be serious about reform police culture and think we should be then we must leave no stone unturned the bill serve to act as one of those many stone in need of turn must stress that the bill be not seek to prevent membership to society not at all and be acutely aware of the right to association and previous precedent that have be set for that in the european convention on human right we in this house work cross party the issue be police one not party political one thank my colleague who have sponsor the bill who come from three different party have speak to so many people about this issue it be conversation enjoy have because they believe as do that something need to be do but many do not dare to speak out so be here speak out once again about reform culture within an organisation know the change that can be make when people speak up have previously set my attention on the welsh rugby union which have be well document believe we in this house can make that important change happen within the police too the police regulations state no restriction other than those design to secure the proper exercise of the function of constable shall be impose by the police authority or the chief officer on the private life of member of police force schedule paragraph state member of police force shall at all time abstain from any activity which be likely to interfere with the impartial discharge of his duty or which be likely to give rise to the impression amongst member of the public that it may so interfere believe that balance need to be strike between those two statement in way that be still in line with both of they in the police and crime commissioner for south wales tell byd ar bedwar welsh tv news programme for those who do not know if member of club or society have to disclose it take away any hidden agenda it would be good to have one common system for local authority police force and health board only then can we ensure everybody be be treat equally for year be teacher subject to disclosure and barring service check but not register of interest as be now as an mp feel very strongly about the significance and role of culture within organisation particularly in public service all organisation have responsibility to change their culture for the well by be honest and transparent about matter relate to governance and day to day operation of course some might argue that if such declaration should be make in police force they should also be make by member of parliament give that we be lawmaker and to they say why not at its inception member of the welsh assembly as it be then be require to declare if they be freemasons and face criminal charge if they be find to be member and have not declare their membership when advise that that might conflict with human right law the assembly look at its policy again now member of the senedd be require to make declaration of membership of any society or organisation which seem an extremely sensible approach be part of society can be inherently positive in enhance friendship foster new connection and promote fundraising but if there be potential for membership of group or society to be use in protect individual from consequence and in hide the truth that must be address restore trust in the police be monumental task and be under no illusion that the bill be magic wand but transparency be essential to that task it be in our power as lawmaker to make change happen change that allow for trust in the police to grow in its report freemasonry in public life the home affairs committee conclude the solution be simple one it require no ban or proscription which generally have no place in democratic society it merely require public servant who be member of secret society or society with secret as freemason use to say to disclose their membership now be the time to move beyond secrecy question put and agree to order that tonia antoniazzi sarah champion neil coyle dame diana johnson ben lake caroline nokes jess phillips liz saville roberts and mr william wragg present the bill tonia antoniazzi accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time friday march and to be print bill political parties elections and referendums relevant document third report of the speaker committee on the electoral commission of response to the draft strategy and policy statement for the electoral commission hc and third report of the speaker committee on the electoral commission of response to the draft strategy and policy statement for the electoral commission hc beg to move that the draft electoral commission strategy and policy statement which be lay before this house on december be approve it be pleasure to be able to present this important strategy and policy statement for parliamentary consideration this afternoon we may disagree on many point but one point on which hope we can agree be that there be plenty of issue in our political life to raise the blood pressure let say respectfully to the house that this strategy and policy statement be not one of they for reason that shall set out the electoral commission strategy and policy statement be lay before parliament on december for approval by resolution of both houses within day period in accordance with section of the political parties elections and referendums act let start by assert clearly and unequivocally concern which know many right hon and hon member have have and which wish to nail from the outset this statement this strategy in no way undermine or challenge the robust legislatively underpin independence of the electoral commission the commission play an important part in our national life it have key and important role and the house and believe the country recognise that the statement give the government no new tooth or power how if and when the commission face into the guidance be up to it and the scrutiny of mr speaker committee on the electoral commission whose role be exercise on behalf of the house the commission as be set out in the act only have duty to have regard we be not say not least because we can not and do not wish to that the commission will or must we create no new duty to report to the government only duty for the speaker committee to maintain its relation with the commission the commission will continue to report only to parliament as it have do since its creation in the statement want to make this very clear because this be twin approach of independence do not politicise mr speaker committee or the office of the speaker in respect of its commission function have be listen to what the minister be say with bit of disbelief if the commission will not have to take any notice of the statement or act on it but need only have regard to it what be it here for if have regard to mean take seriously and do something about that apply both to the commission and to mr speaker committee which have to oversee the commission and its work do that not compromise the neutrality and independence of mr speaker as well as the electoral commission this be very serious matter if that be true it would be serious matter but must say to the hon gentleman for whom have huge respect and who chair the housing communities and local government committee with much distinction that do not see it that way and neither do the government however he take from my explanation of what the statement be not to explain why we be approve it that be the nub of this issue we see see the role of this government and of any party that have the honour to be in government in the united kingdom as that of pro tem custodian of our democracy that be why we have election law and why be the election minister democracy be as we discuss last week in the holocaust memorial day debate fragile flower under huge pressure we believe that the statement be timely not least because of the raft of change that have fly through and be deliver by statutory instrument from the recent elections act we be also hugely cognisant of the threat to the robustness and resilience of our democracy present by overseas interference fake news deepfake and artificial intelligence the solemn role of pro tem custodian and hold the flame of democracy while we serve in government be important rise it be important to underpin rather than undermine the work of the commission by stand shoulder to shoulder with it in the important work that have be set before it which will come to when have take the right hon gentleman intervention be member of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee and we warn in our report about the threat to the independence of the commission from the government legislation regard the strategy statement can understand where the minister be come from when he say that we be not use the expression must because that would be direction but the government be repeatedly use the expression should the question in my mind be if the commission ignore this should what happen there be an imply threat around the should the right hon gentleman helpfully take to the next part of my remark about should would and must let we just canter through with some degree of attention and seriousness the priority set out in the statement in all seriousness hope the house know well enough to know that when use that phrase it be not just parrot line be serious in what be about to say because it be important really would question whether any hon or right hon member of this house of any party would take exception to anything in the statement will the minister answer my question if the right hon gentleman will be little patient he will have his question answer he ask his question in his way and in the word of frank sinatra shall answer it in mine the first paragraph rehearse this key point the electoral commission be the independent regulatory body responsible for give guidance and support to electoral registration officers and returning officer in undertake electoral registration and conduct election and recall petition effectively and in accordance with the law anybody disagree with that no paragraph state the chair of the commission have the responsibility in law for act as the chief counting officer at national referendum in the uk and the staff of the commission support the chair in that role when it be require to work through local electoral authority to deliver such event the delivery of smooth and seamless referenda be not would suggest revolutionary power grab by his majesty government paragraph state the government believe the electoral commission have an important role to play in maintain the integrity of our election and public confidence in that integrity do not think that point will get the division bell ring in answer to the question from the chair of the select committee paragraph continue the duty to have regard do not require the commission to give less priority to or to ignore any of its other statutory duty the electoral commissioners and the commission executive leadership will remain responsible for determine the commission strategy priority how it should discharge its duty include day to day operation and the allocation of its resource as agree by the relevant parliament it will be for the commission to determine how to factor the statement into its decision make process and corporate document such as the five year plan paragraph state one of the government policy priority be ensure our democracy be secure fair modern and transparent one could easily transpose the word government for parliament there who will argue with ensure that our democracy be secure who will argue that our democracy should not be fair modern or transparent paragraph go on to say that it be priority to ensure that those who be entitle to vote should always be able to exercise that right freely securely and in an informed way that fraud intimidation and interference have no place in our democracy that we be the steward of our share democratic heritage which we keep up to date for our age that be my custodian point again paragraph state one of the lead government objective be tackle electoral fraud anyone in this house in favour of electoral fraud do not think so and rightly so paragraph go on to state that the commission should support continue effective delivery of voter identification by raise public awareness about the requirement to show an approve form of photographic identification before take part in uk parliamentary election local election in england and election in northern ireland it have do that in northern ireland for the last year or so this issue be raise in close questioning from the lords constitution committee just the other month the important role of the government the commission and other agency in raise the profile and public awareness of voter identification be matter that we discuss at some length be listen to the minister read out list of the thing that the commission be oblige to do by law anyway so why he have to restate they in this paper do not know the clear advice to the committee and to the speaker committee be that if certain item be identify as priority for the commission other thing would per se be of less priority for example overseas voter registration be priority but the registration of voter in this country where million people be not on the register be not list as priority this skew the work of the electoral commission whether the minister like it or not the hon gentleman be obviously so busy try to find his rebuttal point that he do not listen to my answer to the first question set out clearly that the duty to have regard do not require the commission to give less priority to or ignore any of its other statutory duty the electoral commissioner and the commission executive leadership will remain responsible for determine the commission strategy and priority and how it should discharge its duty the statement in no way undermine countermand or double guess any work of the commission the paper go on to talk about tackle electoral fraud which know we would all wish to do crucially it also talk about the role of the commission in work with return officer and other to ensure the maximum opportunity for those with disability to take part in the ballot on the day and in polling station nobody in this place or the other place would think that be not noble aim rise and at the very mention of noble aim give way to the right hon member for hayes and harlington come back to the fact that this statement in effect set priority for the commission and that have not only operational consequence but budgetary consequence what be the consequence for the commission if like it think the government statement be daft and completely ignore it just do not see that happen because the commission understand the importance of the statement it be not directional document it be an augment document it say because there be difficult thing face our democracy as the right hon gentleman know that the government not party government but government as an entity be in lockstep with the commission in full support of the work that it do to preserve protect and enhance our democracy we feel that it be timely for the secretary of state to provide statement to augment and clarify matter that flow from the political parties elections and referendums act act and subsequent statutory instrument the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts be right to say that the commission be in any case do the thing set out in the statement in whole or in part it will be entirely up to the commission to set its priority from the list and to give great or less attention to matter as need for example it could say well that have already be do and this be all in hand but we really need to augment this matter here the voter authority certificate be prime example there be thing that we would all expect the commission to spend certain amount of time on in order to raise awareness of they the minister be do commendable job give that he have clearly inherit piece of legislation from different era that be part of different agenda he say that thing might need clarify and then mention the voter authority certificate can he give we example of other thing that need clarify what do he think the electoral commission be do that be wrong and that need to be right by this statement nothing if the hon gentleman be look for that then he have completely misunderstood the purpose of the statement and the operational independence of the electoral commission and apportion malign intention to the government know that he want to say oh this be mission creep because that be something else and the government be try to take over an independent be nothing of the sort madam deputy speaker know that other wish to speak they can read the statement for themselves but hope that the example have give indicate that the strategy and policy statement augment what the electoral commission do my department and have good relation with the commission we never seek to direct we admire and respect the work that the speaker committee on the electoral commission do in discharge its duty have the honour of be member of that committee as do the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee the hon member for sheffield south east the hon member for luton south rachel hopkins the hon member for lancaster and fleetwood cat smith and other so it be not even weight in his majesty government favour rise this be benign statement support the commission in its work address the change introduce post the elections act commencement no regulations it be all part of our process to ensure that our electoral system be resilient open transparent secure and have the maximum access to all who have the eligibility to cast vote on whichever election day it may happen to be how they vote be entirely up to they how the commission set its priority be entirely up to it mr speaker and his committee will hold the commission to account not parliament there be no mandate in the statement that the commission have to provide statement or report annually or quarterly to my department or to the secretary of state the usual communication channel between the speaker committee on the electoral commission and the electoral commission remain give the fragility of our democracy and the outside pressure face most western democracy today suggest to right hon and hon member that in try to ascribe ill intention machiavellian motivation and some sort of surreptitious purpose of undermine democracy to this benign statement of good will they demean themselves and they demean and weaken democracy call the shadow minister thank the minister for his introduction have lot of respect for the minister but struggle to listen to he through gritted tooth he try but fail desperately to justify why this statement be need you can not flog dead horse and if something ai break it do need to be fix in the previous labour government set up the electoral commission to act as guardian of our democratic system at the heart of that decision be the need for central pillar of independence within our politic body that the public could trust that would not suffer interference not just from the government of the day but from future government of any shade that would not fear the consequence of take on major party when they break the rule and that could provide information about our system from trust source free of political interference over year later the commission independence have become cornerstone of public trust in our democracy let put the strategy and policy statement into context sadly year of tory failure have leave many people feel powerless at the decline under this government people have see their hard earn money go to tory friend and vip donor people who follow the rule to protect the nhs see those who make the rule break they grow up not far from this place on council estate in brixton just bus ride away what annoy and anger be see decision be make about my community by people who do not feel the ramification the government need to reflect on that hope the minister will and realise why trust in our politic be at record low after so many scandal from this place during this time the independence of the electoral commission have act as bedrock in our system against decline trust while we have see recent drop in confidence and satisfaction in the system majority of people remain satisfied with the voting process agree with the minister that there be always thing we can do to improve our democratic process but this statement be set political agenda for an independent watchdog that be completely wrong minister and you know it and that be not just say that order the hon lady be make powerful speech but beg of she would she please call the minister the minister not you be not blame the hon lady bad example have be set by senior member of the house call other member you or minister phrase such as and you know it be exactly why we do not have that way of do thing here because that refer to the occupant of the chair apologise for pull she up on this because she be far from be the first person to get it wrong but if we do not start to put it right people will not understand the reason for the rule thank you for highlight that madam deputy speaker totally agree with you will refer to the minister it not only say that there be issue with the statement the speaker committee on the electoral commission the levelling up housing and communities committee and even the electoral commission itself have all highlight problem with the statement these be not random body in fact they be so respected that the government themselves make it mandatory to consult they prior to bring the strategy and policy statement to the house yet when all three raise the same concern the government simply railroad the statement through madam deputy speaker you would expect government who disregard the powerful point make by these respected body to have clear evidence base for their action for the minister to repeat what the electoral commission be do fantastically well be not the basis for the statement in announce the statement the government say this guidance address the concern raise in lord eric pickles independent review into electoral fraud that the current system of oversight of the electoral commission be not fit for purpose give that we would expect to find robust justification for this statement in what the minister outline however all we get on the system for oversight be three bury line on page of that seven year old report no detail justification or evidence wow when the levelling up housing and communities committee find it be not aware that any of those concern remain current from the relevant section of the pickles report and when so many respected body be say the statement be unnecessary surely the minister must see that the very basis for make the statement be simply not good enough under this government trust in our politic and democratic institution be at an all time low we all need to work hard to restore that trust give people belief that their voice matter and that decision be make with they not to they this be another example of decision be make to they instead the content of the statement completely undermine the electoral commission represent dangerous threat to the independence of vital watchdog mp from all party have condemn it and respected body have reject it which be further proof that we need new approach to democracy that work for everyone urge hon member to join we in vote against this dangerous politicisation of our independent election watchdog rise to make short contribution to the debate welcome the work that have be do on the policy statement have read the examination undertake by the speaker committee on the electoral commission and the report by the levelling up housing and communities committee be glad the government have respond to element of the critique also acknowledge the incredibly important role that mr speaker and his committee play in the exist governance of the electoral commission want to make sure that be on the record because they do their job well for and suspect other colleague who support the elections act the source of today instrument there be couple of additional argument that should be put alongside what the minister have say first it be reasonable to have strategy and policy statement other regulator such as ofcom and ofgem have one secondly this debate be an opportunity for the whole chamber to engage in the electoral commission work rather wish that the chamber be even full be that as it may this be rightly an opportunity for more right hon and hon member other than those who sit on the speaker committee or on the select committee to take part rise be happy to give way to the chair of the select committee do the hon lady not accept that compare this with other regulator be profoundly confusing they be different regulate the water industry with the government quite rightly have view about how our water purity sewerage and so on should be control be completely different from the government interfere in how an independent electoral commission should carry out its operation be grateful to the hon member for make that point let say in respectful tone of voice that be glad to see the depth of work that he have do on this but hope that he recognise that there be many of we on the conservative benches who have also spend very many year focus on this area my answer to he would be that there be partial similarity and there be partial difference think that he be wrong and that some of his colleague be unwise to throw quite so many accusation in such tone today in part there be good reason why it be reasonable to set out in one place the government priority which as the statement set out be adjacent and relevant to matter to do with the regulator that be what today document do he be right that that be somewhat different from the more detailed work that be do by the regulator of water and electricity and so on he be also right of course to point to the essential independence of the electoral commission be glad that he have do so because it give the opportunity to add my emphasis to that as well there be nothing to be concern about from this statement in respect of the independence of the commission we have hear those assurance from the minister today it be extremely important that he have set that out and be glad that he have do so and add my voice to the essential nature of that but want briefly to go back to the need for wide participation in the work of the electoral commission we be able to spend periodically few minute of question time on the speaker committee on the electoral commission and good work be do through that mechanism but it be perhaps somewhat indirect it be important for the whole chamber to be able to look at the important issue that sit behind our constitution and our electoral system wish to move on to the content of the strategy and policy statement be work in particular from the point that we see in paragraph where it be emphasise that this regulator need to work together with other to discharge its duty want to emphasise that in the context of the demand be make on regulator this year with regard to artificial intelligence member will be very well aware of that from the white paper on regulate artificial intelligence which be set out last year and on which we be shortly to have an update from different department the key point be this it be the world big election year billion of citizen will be go to the ballot box include here these election will be the first to happen since the significant advance in ai there be legitimate concern anxiety and indeed evidence from our security service for we to ask whether this technology will be use for fabrication for manipulation and to affect the integrity of election it go without say that the integrity of election matter so that people free choice achieve what they intend the government have ask regulator across their field to set out how they will work with artificial intelligence clearly the electoral commission be one of those regulator and somewhat in the hotseat in this regard it be my view that in respect of the grand concern and anxiety the electoral commission and connected enforcement agency could helpfully set out the preparation that they have do and give reassurance publicly about their readiness for election this year with reference to the substance of today statement ask the minister what discussion he have have with the electoral commission on its work with other regulator for example as per paragraph and of the statement which talk about keep up to date with the reality of campaigning activity think that be good tone to take there also ask the minister in what way he expect to keep the statement itself and future iteration of the statement update in regard to technology and national security consideration where those might be relevant agree with the minister that we here be steward of our democracy have be in his particular position before set out the approach that we ought always to strive for our election to be secure fair modern accessible and transparent also agree that this be some of the most important work that we can do none the less conclude by say gently that it be legitimate function of government to address themselves to these principle that be what we need the government and parliament to do because we be the custodian of law as well as of those principle we do that with the elections act and we do it prior to that with the political parties elections and referendums act we have also do it before then and since then and we will continue to do so it be legitimate function of government to enact change and update to electoral law when they be ask to do so perhaps through manifesto commitment in democratic process we do that through parliament so it be good as have say that we have this wide opportunity for parliament to be able to engage in the work of the electoral commission while crucially respect its design and independence and be glad that we be get that chance to do so today call the snp spokesman it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for norwich north chloe smith not least because she be the minister who bring in the elections act which have give rise to the motion today the minister on the front bench today whom hold in the high regard be either the fifth or the sixth minister have lose count from the second government department who have have responsibility for manifestation of that legislation whether it be the bill proceeding or delegate legislation since its first reading in that do not say much for the continuity of this government or their commitment to get right the regulation of election that perhaps be hardly surprise in fact as have allude to much of the statement and much of what we be do today be hangover from slightly different era more muscular era of the conservative government that be pity because on the one hand the elections act be massive miss opportunity to consolidate and update electoral law properly for the next quarter of the century and on the other it provide for significant regression in the access to and potential fairness of uk wide election and certain other election in england and wales it remove proportionality from mayoral election and it impose the burden of photo identification particularly on poor and marginalised community while at the same time extend the franchise to million of voter from overseas who have much less in the way of verification and now on the floor of the house today we have the cherry on top the crown glory of this government intervention on our election process the strategy and policy statement for the electoral commission the commission be suppose to be the independent regulator of election across these island it be body that already have extremely clear function which be set out on statutory basis in the political parties elections and referendums act my first question to the minister be this what be this statement be it the law be it statutory instrument be it delegate legislation it be tell that the government have table debate in the chamber rather than pass this to dl committee because have feeling that that be their original intention and that the minister would have prefer that give the scrutiny and publicity he be now face but here we be in the chamber and be not entirely sure if motion to approve strategy and policy statement be delegate legislation it seem that the commission be not legally bind to follow the strategy and policy but only to have regard to it as other have ask what do that mean what happen if the commission find itself conflict between the statement and the statute can it be challenge in the court and if so by whom by political party by non party campaigner by the government themselves if it be not the law how be it to be enforce who decide if the commission be compliant or not know the minister and you madam deputy speaker enjoy some deftly deploy latin so perhaps this be good time to ask the classical question quis custodiet ipsos custode who watch the watcher or in this case who commission the commissioner the answer to that question be that it be this house it be parliament that recommend commissioner for appointment by the monarch by mean of humble address it be parliament that establish the commission in the first place through the political parties elections and referendums act the commission be accountable to the speaker committee of members of this house and through other mechanism to the parliaments in scotland wales and northern ireland we can therefore look at this statement and the motion before we and ask whether the government be usurp the sovereignty of this house the motion be unamendable much as some of we would have like to amend it to mandate the government to abandon the statement and repeal the relevant section of the elections act and the statement be unamendable the government run limited consultation limit in time and limit in the number of consultee where be the parliamentary sovereignty in that the only way in which the scottish government be able to express their view be in letter from my good friend the minister for parliamentary business george adam msp to the levelling up housing and communities committee of this house that be probably fair reflection of what this government think be the place of scotland parliament and government in the modern united kingdom as subsidiary of the housing committee of the house of commons the statement do not have any effect on the electoral commission function in the devolved nation but by definition that increase divergence of practice which be perhaps surprise give the uk government determination to promote the broad shoulder of the union in his letter minister adam make clear that like almost every other stakeholder and every other voice we have hear with the exception of those on the government benches who have take an interest in this matter he consider the strategy and policy statement to be an unwelcome and unnecessary interference with the independence of the electoral commission he make the extremely valid point that the statement preamble say that it do not suggest that the commission should cease to carry out any of its other statutory duty he also rightly suggest this appear to raise the alarming prospect that such suggestion might feature in future version of the sps surely change in the function of the commission would require change in the statute it would be helpful to hear the minister response to those point in get to the heart of what this statement be or be not suppose to achieve if it be largely restatement of the principle and function that the commission be already carry out as the minister seek to assure we in his most emollient tone it seem to be surplus to requirement perhaps the minister could give we some example of what as result of the statement he think the commission will do differently or well if the statement be simply change the emphasis on certain function that go back to the point raise in my intervention why be that necessary what do the minister think the commission be do wrong and why do the government need to direct what be suppose to be an independent regulator the elections act be of course just one step in pernicious series that this government in their different incarnation have take to shield themselves from accountability and to reduce the openness and transparency of democracy across the uk the dissolution and calling of parliament act restore the prerogative of call an election to the prime minister alone with all the consequence that be have for the tory back benchers the press gallery and the podcast studio of westminster the police crime sentencing and courts act have restrict the right to protest the united kingdom internal market act and sundry other piece of brexit legislation have ride roughshod over the sewel convention and deliberately weaken and undermine the devolution settlement perhaps it should be no surprise therefore that the government have the independent regulator of election next in their sight the conservative party be clearly not go to have an easy time at the next election and it have clearly decide that therefore neither should anybody else whether they be candidate political party non party campaigner an electoral registration officer return officer or some other official or indeed the electoral commission itself the time to introduce election legislation reform be usually at the beginning of parliament so that everyone involve have time to prepare and implement the change not at the desperate fag end of session as part of what appear to be scorch earth policy by the current government that do mean that there be some serious question for the official opposition as well and indeed for all of we write our manifesto be the official opposition prepare to repeal or amend aspect of the elections act should they have the opportunity to do so at some point in future will they commit to get rid of this statement and certainly to not publish any of their own in the meantime the government need to hear from the house that this statement be at well unnecessary and at bad which be more likely an undermining of the independence of the electoral commission and indeed its accountability to this house rather than to the government of the day member on the government benches wherever they be they be clearly not that interested in this motion who believe far more fervently in parliamentary sovereignty than those of we who believe in popular sovereignty believe in that should consider whether this be really the road they want to go down if they do not want to go down this road they should join those of we who respect the independence of the electoral commission and who want to see fairness and transparency across election on these island in vote against this statement or whatever it be rise this debate have to finish at pm ask colleague to be aware of that there be five more speaker and little brevity might help be speak today as chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee and member of the speaker committee on the electoral commission also declare my interest as vice president of the local government association when the minister be give responsibility for local government finance he no doubt think that he have get the hospital pass which some minister get from time to time when they have very challenging brief and very difficult situation to face then he realise that that hospital pass be come down the road straight away and that he be go to have to try to justify this statement today he do good job of tell we what the current responsibility be of the electoral commission what he do not do be give we one example of something that the commission be not do right at present which they will be make to do right and well by this statement what be the problem that need address and if the motion pass in this house what will be different tomorrow from today he do not give one example of that that be why in the end both the levelling up housing and communities committee and the speaker committee say that at bad this statement process compromise the independence of the electoral commission the commission believe that as well and at well it be simply unnecessary and will contribute nothing whatsoever say to the minister and he have make this point that democracy be of course very precious and it be the responsibility of all of we to protect it the electoral commission be very important part of that process in its oversight of election and the electoral process in this country so it must be see to be independent not just independent in practice but perceive to be independent despite what the minister say in the very detailed way he address the statement the perception be that the government be try to do something to influence the electoral commission if they be not what be the point of this if they have no intention of influence the electoral commission we should just let it get on with the current situation and be accountable to mr speaker committee that be surely where we ought to be the speaker committee and the levelling up housing and communities committee have very helpful advice from senior and authoritative officer in this house who conclude in report to our committees that the statement would constitute interference with the commission operational independence that be what we be advise we be advise that no cogent explanation have be put forward for why the statement be need we have not hear one today either the minister do the good job he could but it be not coherent and cogent explanation far we be tell that it be hard to see how this statement would help the commission in its work the statement say that the commission should have regard to the way in which it operate and give it certain priority if among the commission many responsibility some have to be priority other must be of low priority that be pretty self evident as conclusion those other thing be less important either that direct the commission to concentrate its resource on the thing that the government think be important or the commission will just ignore it and walk away either way we do not know what we be here for either we be here to interfere with the work of the commission direct it and give it priority or we be simply here to say to the commission there be some thing that the government think be rather nice but go away and ignore they because they do really matter that not your statutory responsibility ultimately the commission have statutory responsibility we be advise on the committee that some of the wording in the statement differ from the wording in law so the commission could be catch between follow the law and follow the guidance it would end up in court with lawyer make lot of money from the conflict lawyer always make money where there be confusion in wording the government ought to be careful about what they be ask we to do reference be make to other regulator other regulator be essentially agent of government for example ofwat exist to carry out government policy about how our water should be keep clean the electoral commission be not an agent of government it be therefore very different from the other regulator the agent that the right hon member for norwich north chloe smith and ministers have refer to it go back to the question that put to the minister if other regulator fail to abide by the direction give by government they be remove we have not hear what the consequence will be from the government of not abide by the range of should within the statement absolutely no consequence be lay out for what will happen if the statement be not follow by the electoral commission wonder whether it be bad than that regulator should be remove if they be find to be incompetent give the state of the water industry with ofwat and the environment agency the government probably ought to be step in and remove those regulator but they be not yes perhaps the government ought to pay more attention to those problem rather than to one that seem not to exist the minister have not tell we what problem the statement be intend to address rise think the minister be go to help we with that politely ask the chair of the select committee where in my remark open the debate talk about other regulatory body and try to rank they pari passu with the electoral commission will tell he where do it do not the minister right hon friend the member for norwich north raise it and she be the minister who take the bill through parliament so it be worth take seriously what she have to say the minister do not tell we what problem the statement be mean to address it would be helpful if he do so interruption order be sorry madam deputy speaker be just try to encourage the minister to be helpful to we obviously be struggle in that regard rise be the minister now go to be helpful be try to be helpful read hansard have answer the hon gentleman question three time if he neither understand nor can hear the answer that be not my fault the minister be clearly try to be helpful but not succeed in the end it come back to the point that the electoral commission priority do not have to be the government priority and the government have no right to direct the commission in its work again ask what problem be the motion design to address if the minister can not articulate what the problem be and how the statement will change the behaviour of the electoral commission frankly every member of this house be busy and have lot of thing to do have we just waste minute of our time because in two year we will come back and find that today motion have no impact rather hope that that be the case because the other scenario would be that the government be interfere in the electoral commission work which be the bad of the two way of look at this it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts associate myself with everything he say which allow to cut short my speech be conscious of time madam deputy speaker when prepare for the debate take little time to learn what the public think of the electoral commission some research be carry out and the word most frequently use by voter to describe the commission be independent important and professional at time in our politic when fake news misinformation and artificial intelligence be see as threat and frankly be threat to the security of our democracy indeed during prime minister question early we have member spread fake news about vaccine and thing should it not be source of great pride for our country that the electoral commission be hold in such high regard by voter who rely on it to safeguard the independence of election and of democracy itself fairness and accountability in electoral regulation depend on strong and independent regulator which be what the electoral commission be it fulfil the vital role of oversee our election and regulate political finance in the uk the commission independence be establish in statute as public body independent of government and accountable to parliament through the speaker committee on the electoral commission for which be spokesperson regularly attend the chamber and answer question from colleague on both side of the house about the commission work in healthy modern democracy we should seek compromise on matter of democracy and the regulation of election and not allow one party to set all the rule one party be in government today but there will have to be an election and should another party form the next government they could author the next statement we need to ensure that the structure that we agree as house can withstand change of political party in government political party that be not represent in the house today might one day be elect to this house and they might not value democracy as much as know all right hon and hon member here today do the structure that we be be ask to approve today come straight out of republican party playbook of politicise the electoral commission those of we who see that as threat do so because we look at what be go on in other country and other democracy we also look at what have be go on here through the various iteration of conservative governments over the past year the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady set out some of this already but it be worth reiterate that this be not first offence this be government who repeal the fixed term parliaments act to allow prime minister to decide when the start whistle can be blow on general election this be government who change the way that electoral registration work move from household registration to individual electoral registration which mean that million of people fall off the electoral roll at which point the government decide to draw the new electoral boundary use the number in that snapshot by the way those electoral boundary be for mp because at that point that number look advantageous to the conservative party then we have the general election and the picture look little different it be then more electorally advantageous for the conservative party to have member so guess what happen yes with absolutely no explanation we go back to member the freedom to protest peacefully be important in democracy but it have be curtail under this government the elections act contain plethora of thing that be damaging to the security and safety of our democracy voter id have be widely discuss in this house and it be true that it be easy for some voter to vote with photo id than it be for other now ex minister slip up and accidentally say what be actually happen which be that an attempt to gerrymander in the government favour have suddenly be find not to be in their favour voter id be an attempt to make voting hard for those who be not plan to vote conservative and easy for those who be plan to vote conservative although it arguably backfire somewhat the government be also change the rule on who can vote which be important and this week we have see change that remove the year limit on overseas voter we now have situation in which person who have live outside this country for year can vote in uk general election but year old who have live in the uk all their life can not vote in uk general election who get to vote be political this be the politicisation of the electoral commission the elections act change the electoral system for police and crime commissioner and mayors to the party political advantage of the conservative party the general election spending threshold for political party have be raise way above inflation with absolutely no explanation other than that the conservative party feel confident that it have the money to spend now we have strategy and policy statement to direct the work of our independent commission will call it what it be this be the politicisation of the independent electoral commission all member of this house who believe in the independence of our electoral commission would do well to cast their vote against this motion today because the consequence will be far range the point of the minister statement which he have now read out several time be that any future government may set the direction and policy priority of the independent electoral commission let we keep politic out of the electoral commission by oppose this motion today it be privilege to follow my hon friend the member for lancaster and fleetwood cat smith who make some excellent point refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests as too be vice president of the local government association rise to make very short speech oppose the government motion and the conservative party effort to undermine the election watchdog the last labour government set up the electoral commission to protect britain democracy through the independent regulation of free and fair election the commission independence from government of any shade must be crystal clear for voter and campaigner to see as member of the speaker committee on the electoral commission and for the minister benefit the member of parliament for luton south have already share my opposition to the government draft strategy and policy statement on the electoral commission at time when trust in our politic be low ministers use this statement to set political agenda for the electoral commission be dangerous act that undermine its independence my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts put that well too even on its own merit the statement fail to explain why it be require in the first place and it provide no further support for scrutiny of the commission work this beg the question what be the point as we know there be cross party agreement that the commission independence be vital to the health of our democracy and both the levelling up housing and communities committee and the speaker committee have conclude that no statement be necessary the electoral commission have rightly point out that the repeal of the government power to designate statement would improve confidence and trust in our electoral system that beg another question why do the government introduce the strategy and policy statement power in the elections act perhaps if we put it in the context of very unpopular decline conservative party that be out of idea it could be suggest that it be try to assert an unfair influence on the rule of engagement at the next general election alongside the strategy and policy statement power the elections act also introduce repressive voter id requirement solution to non existent problem yet we be still wait to see any action on or prioritisation of the real issue face our democracy such as disinformation and ai there be no concerted plan to get under represent group and people turn on to the electoral register will the minister explain why as my hon friend the member for lancaster and fleetwood put it so well we be see the alarming trend emerge of government tighten their grip on the delicate functioning of democracy it seem that with this statement the conservative party be purposefully seek to undermine public trust in order to serve its own interest perhaps the minister can try again to convince we otherwise be it arrogance or weakness that be inform these decision in any event the public be under no illusion and can see this for what it be labour will continue to oppose all reckless act that threaten to undermine our democracy and labour will fight for every vote in every part of the country the only people who will be decide britain future be the british public should say from the off that would not allege that the government want to achieve something untoward by the statement be not for moment suggest that they be seek somehow to introduce this guidance for the electoral commission to gain political advantage for the conservative party however perception matter the minister say that the statement be about resilient open transparent secure modern and fair democracy but many of our constituent will ask what be wrong with the current system the fact be that nothing be wrong with the current system of the electoral commission report to the house not to the government be surprised to have receive considerable correspondence from constituent on this subject which have think would be of little interest to people in devon let give the house an example of that correspondence as your constituent be urge you to please consider vote against the draft electoral commission and policy statement on wednesday no government or political party should be able to have any say in the commission strategy or policy the electoral commission exist to run election it seem obvious to and my liberal democrat colleague that the electoral commission need not only to be impartial but to be see to be impartial the concern express by my constituent and feel by my party have also be highlight by two committees of this house the cross party levelling up housing and communities committee which be so ably chair and the speaker committee which have publish its third report on the electoral commission of those committees have make it plain that we do not need this additional government guidance to the electoral commission if that be not enough the commission itself say that the government have strategy and policy statement be inconsistent with the independent role of the electoral commission that be why and my liberal democrat colleague will vote against the statement the minister be well than this motion let we all agree on that like the snp spokesperson the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady think it be hangover from the boris johnson day when the electoral commission upset he and he want to influence it the minister can correct if be wrong the government claim that this strategy will enhance the parliamentary accountability of the electoral commission and increase public confidence in its work but as everybody have state today it will do the complete opposite this strategy and policy statement be little more than an attempt by the government to undermine the independence of the electoral commission and to stamp their own agenda on the regulation of our democracy this be fight for our democracy we in this house need to take back control that be important avoid transparency and accountability seem to be the hallmark of the government do not just take my word for it the electoral commission itself write to mps this week stress that the principle of independence be crucial to maintain confidence in our electoral system it warn member the introduction of mechanism such as strategy and policy statement by which government can guide an electoral commission work be inconsistent with this independent role if the commission be say that and the speaker committee be say it why be the minister try to convince we otherwise it really do not make any sense as we have hear many time this be not the first time that the government have attempt to rig our democracy they force through their voter id system which threaten to disenfranchise the most vulnerable in society remember that as my hon friend the member for lancaster and fleetwood cat smith mention the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg let it slip that that be deliberate attempt to manipulate electoral outcome in favour of the conservative party and then go whoops because he have make mistake and say the quiet bit out loud it be not shock that the government be once again attempt to influence an independent body that oversee our election but it should shock we all this draft strategy and policy statement set out the government strategic and policy priority for the electoral commission it also contain guidance to which the commission must have regard in the discharge of its function that place on the commission concern legal duty to consider first and foremost the government priority when fulfil its duty if it do that it can not be independent and the whole point be that it be suppose to be independent it be simply unacceptable for the government to direct the commission on how it should carry out its function if foreign government be wield that much power over their election there would be call to send in independent adviser to ensure that their election be be hold democratically that be how bad this be when people ask do we have corruption in our government say yes we do and this be an example of that the government keep focus on the prevention and detection of voter fraud yet there be little evidence that voter fraud be widespread in fact it be so rare that there be only nine conviction order the hon lady talk about corruption in government want she to withdraw that she need to rephrase what she say she do know that she be very experienced so ask she to say at this point that she withdraw any allegation of corruption within government thank you madam deputy speaker withdraw the statement that the government be corrupt or that there be corruption in the government do not know for sure but withdraw that statement there be however issue that need tackle and the motion do not achieve that there be rise consideration such as the threat of generative ai the use of deepfake the spread of disinformation and the scraping of people datum none of that have be tackle today wonder why although accord to the fact check organisation first draft of the conservative party most share online advert in the final day of the general election campaign be find to have contain misleading information when the minister get to his foot hope that he will change his mind because he be respect across the house and this motion be go to damage his reputation as have say urge the house to take back control and reject the motion first thank all right hon and hon member for their contribution this afternoon to address the last part of the speech make by the hon member for brent central dawn butler have be very grateful to colleague on the opposition benches who have say some rather nice and kind word about personally will not press to division the question of whether deserve those nice and kind word be not sure how my side of the house would vote say this in all seriousness hope the house know well enough to know that if think the intention that sit behind this statement the elections act or any of the statutory instrument that have flow from that act be what hon member have assert they be would have tender my resignation to the prime minister as democrat as somebody who have stand in election who have lose and win election and who have serve in this place if only for eight and half year can say that there be nothing malign or mission creep in anything that we be discuss today be not expect that sentiment to change the vote of opposition members but say it sincerely number of member have ask where the statement come from its genesis be of course to be find in section to of the political parties elections and referendums act insert by the elections act that be where it come from will try to address some of the comment that have be make my shadow the hon member for vauxhall florence eshalomi say that there be political agenda there be not we pay full regard to the submission of consultees and we take different view from they that be perfectly fine it do not undermine the system nor be it dangerous politicisation of the commission believe my right hon friend the member for norwich north chloe smith distinguished former election minister be right when she refer to this as reasonable vehicle she ask about my discussion with the commission have have very useful meeting with its senior team at which we discuss range of issue and how we can work together to support and buttress our democracy those conversation will continue the statement be iterative and organic and it can of course be refresh to reflect issue and challenge as they arise in the field of ai overseas involvement and so on the house will notice that use the word they arise not if my hon friend the member for glasgow north patrick grady call he an hon friend because he be friend ask where be the parliamentary sovereignty when the division bell ring that be the exercise of parliament sovereignty and he will vote accordingly the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts in an rather confusing way say he think the statement be wrong because it do not mandate the commission or tell it what to do and then go on in almost the same breath to say how frightful it would be if the statement could do that be afraid the hon gentleman be prove to be on this issue and on this issue alone little bit of pushmi pullyu because the independence of the commission be absolutely safe and sacrosanct let read back into the record from the statement that the duty to have regard do not require the commission to give less priority to or to ignore any of its other statutory duty the electoral commissioners and the commission executive leadership will remain responsible for determine the commission strategy priority how it should discharge its duty and so on and so forth within its five year plan the commission will not be report to my right hon friend the secretary of state no or the cabinet office it will continue to report to parliament through mr speaker committee use the function it have will the minister give way hope the hon gentleman will forgive but will not because the house have lot of business today let address the point that have be raise by other because want to give due attention to the point they have make the hon member for lancaster and fleetwood cat smith really should have word with her own front benchers about overseas voter let quote from her hon friend the member for vauxhall on the statutory instrument we take upstairs on wednesday december when from the labour front bench she tell the committee we do not oppose the principle of overseas voting and give citizen who still have strong connection to the uk voice in our election and that include people who still have strong connection to our local service and report eighth delegated legislation committee december so the hon member for lancaster and fleetwood be entirely out of step with her hon friend on the front bench thank the minister for give way this time wish to object in that the minister be very much misportraye the point make in my remark the point make be that it be political decision to decide who get to vote and be compare year old in the uk with someone who have live outside the uk for year that be the point raise and do not think it be at all inconsistent with those on my own party front bench hear the hon lady very clearly say that in principle she be oppose to overseas voter if misheard she then apologise but that be certainly the thrust of the remark she make the hon member for luton south rachel hopkins describe the statement as political agenda be improve disabled access have political agenda if so or if that be the charge be go to plead guilty be crack down on electoral fraud if that be the charge clap in iron be ensure that the rule of registration and the importance of voter id be promote if so take off to the tower plead guilty as charge the minister rather misportraye what just say say that this statement either seek to change how the electoral commission operate in which case it be interference with an independent body or do not seek to do that in which case what be the point of it the point as have consistently say be to augment and buttress the work of the commission and to give some reference tool in parliament assessment also want to take issue with the hon member for lancaster and fleetwood again hope hear she correctly who pray in aid the fix term parliaments act as if it be an ancient symbol of our democratic function that we have repeal it sit for five year as way of give confidence to the market that coalition of two party could deliver the clean up strategy for what her party have leave behind in so its repeal be not dismantling of some great permanent piece of our democratic architecture the hon member for brent central seem to refer to this as vendetta against the commission let just invite she refer to it as vendetta write the word down the record will say that she think that mr johnson as prime minister be wag vendetta against the commission because the commission have say something with which he disagree that be the word the hon lady use and will play it back to she advisedly take contemporaneous note of the word as she use it let just invite she to consider that if we wish to wage war against the commission we could neuter it fetter it force it to report to we and we could abolish it but we have and we will why will we why be we it be because we know that the commission be important we respect its work and we honour cherish and guard its independence we believe that this statement and the previous legislation that this house have put through will augment the accountability of the commission to parliament and in so do serve this as its sole and only purpose to build on parliament and the public confidence in its work the commission be and be independent and it will continue to be independent commend this motion to the house question put adam afriyie nickie aiken peter aldous lucy allan lee anderson stuart anderson stuart andrew

williams munira wilson beth winter pete wishart mohammad yasin daniel zeichner kim leadbeater gerald jones the house divide ayes noes question accordingly agree to resolve that the draft electoral commission strategy and policy statement which be lay before this house on december be approve social security beg to move that the draft social security benefit up rat order which be lay before this house on january be approve the draft order will increase relevant state pension rate by in line with the growth in average earning in the year to july it will also increase most other benefit rate by in line with the rise in the consumer price index in the year to september subject to parliamentary approval the change will take effect from april and will apply for the tax year interruption order may ask those not participate in the debate to leave quietly it be difficult to hear the minister the government commitment order minister have just be ask to clarify that you be move motion on social security yes that be the one be talk about thank you for clarify that for the information of the house this order cover state pension motion cover the guarantee minimum pension which be sub element of the pension issue as will explain the different element on point of order madam deputy speaker can clarify whether we be take motion on social security and motion in one debate or will we scrutinise the order separately it would be helpful for the house to have clarity on exactly what be happen we be debate motion on social security we will then debate motion on pension two debate or one debate two separate debate indeed few day ago be ask those question about whether to take the motion separately or together they be be take separately be very relieved that we be get proper uprating this year but the current headline rate of benefit be the low it have be in real term for year why have ministers set benefit at level so much low in real term than be choose by margaret thatcher peter lilley john major or norman fowler why be it so much low there be always lively debate about the adequacy of the overall benefit system think beveridge have the debate under the labour government in on how to understand the concept of adequacy within the benefit system what we be do be ensure that the purchase power of benefit be maintain and that we be adhere to the triple lock the right hon gentleman intervention allow to restate think for the fifth time the government commitment to the triple lock mean that the basic and state pension will be uprate by the high of growth in earning or in price or by this year that will mean an rise from take the basic state pension from to week and the full rate of the new state pension from to week additional state pension such as the state earning relate pension scheme and protect payment of the new state pension will rise by the government be commit to support pensioner on the low income and accordingly the safety net provide by the pension credit standard minimum guarantee will increase by for single pensioner it will increase by to and for couple it will increase from to per week when it come to support for those in the labour market such as universal credit and the means test benefit it replace there be always need to take into account work incentive as well as financial support for those in low pay work who be look for work or who be unable to work the government announce range of employment and conditionality measure at the autumn statement to maintain and improve work incentive however in strike balance it be also right to increase the rate of those benefit by in line with the increase in cpi in the year to september that increase mean that universal credit will retain its purchasing power in the broad context of the prime minister deliver commitment to halve the rate of inflation the government remain mindful of work incentive in the benefit system and accordingly this order also increase the universal credit work allowance by they will increase from to per month for those also receive support with housing cost and from to per month for those not receive support with housing cost that increase will also apply to the rate for contributory jobseeker allowance contributory employment and support allowance additional need disability benefit such as the personal independence payment carer allowance and statutory payment such as statutory maternity pay statutory paternity pay and statutory sick pay the draft order if parliament approve it commit the government to increase expenditure of billion in we believe it be right to make such commitment because it maintain the triple lock which benefit both pensioner already in receipt of the basic and new state pension and young people who be build up future entitlement as foundation for private saving it raise the level of the safety net in pension credit beyond the increase in price and be part of package of support for those in the labour market which protect the value of benefit at time of high if fall inflation while maintain and increase work incentive the draft order maintain the purchase power of benefit to help with additional cost arise from disability it also provide protection against inflation for people who be currently unable to participate in the labour market such as full time carer who provide such an essential service to those they care for on that basis commend this order to the house thank the minister for clarify the way we be take these order today we welcome the social security uprating because we want to see social security keep pace with price particularly at time of spike inflation and economic instability however it be worth point out that before uprating in the manner we be do it today be the norm for both labour and conservative governments but the past decade and half have see change and variable approach to uprating from this government the debate about uprating have become almost farcical year by year there be speculation presume from some part of government that the uprating that be standard year in year out under previous government may or may not happen that speculation do not come out of thin air it cause immense amount of distress and worry for people it be almost as though there have to be campaign for the status quo which be not acceptable wonder why we be in what seem to be policy roundabout where every time we have this debate about uprating only for the government to do it that be problematic way to do what be normal function of social security to keep pace with the cost of living we have to be honest about the reality of the situation we face we have have universal credit for decade or more and have be in this house long enough to have hear promise after promise that it would radically improve people work incentive and that people position in life would be make much well by universal credit reform the dwp have many talented civil servant who be sure have work hard to try to make the customer service element function well but we have to look at reality more child be now in poverty than when labour leave office in that be not acceptable to most people in poverty today be in work so the idea that we hear again and again in this chamber that the good route out of poverty be work be simply not true two third of child in poverty live in house where someone go out to work would like the government to recognise that fact we have have decade and half of so call reform and all we have do be get back to the situation where child be grow up deal with the stress of not have enough money in the family home to give they proper childhood that be not acceptable we see the consequence of decade and half of tory rule all around we whether the food bank parcel in the school office the nurse who do hour shift but can not make end meet or in the bad case the man curl up in sleep bag in westminster tube station as we leave this house we see the consequence of conservative government all around we labour have plan to get people well life able to make end meet and with good start for their child we will ensure that there be breakfast club in every primary school we will help people have access to cheap energy and an insulated home to deal with the spike in cost that people have face in recent year we will reform universal credit jobcentre and employment support to ensure that people get well job with well pay to help they live their life properly and save money for the treasury we will have child poverty strategy that will overhaul universal credit on social security simply say this we need an end to the uprating roundabout we be simply ask for consistency of approach so that as in previous decade under government of all kind we have the proper uprating of social security without the constant speculation from wherever it be in the conservative government that somehow ordinary work people must pay the price of the government economic chaos that be not fair let we end the chaos and have proper normal uprating in the usual way welcome the rise in benefit and the state pension it would have be unthinkable not to raise benefit by inflation and equally unthinkable not to increase the state pension in line with the triple lock the government have do the right thing these be the right decision and will happily support these order in the unlikely event of division agree with the shadow minister the hon member for wirral south alison mcgovern that this be not the most exciting piece of parliamentary theatre even though we be spend ten of billion through these order the house be empty these instrument go through on the nod we can not amend they and the whole process create load of uncertainty for people who have to live on these benefit agree that if we be go to find the money to put these benefit up quite rightly by the two high amount in my year in this place and probably go back lot far let we just change the process and have default increase by cpi and in line with the triple lock so that we do not have to go through all this uncertainty in what scenario now be we not go to increase benefit and the state pension by cpi or the triple lock if any future government want to do something different they could just bring in bill as george osborne do in the early year of the coalition the house would be require to give its assent to that change but we would not have to go through the uncertainty and the annual campaign to get to where we all think we be go to get to anyway which do not help anybody it would spare the minister this afternoon excitement and the confusion of what be in which of these order which he might appreciate will leave that one for the minister and see whether he be remotely tempt by it with the crazy process we currently have we have come to the right answer but still do not really believe that we be in sensible position we have to use september inflation for an april increase in benefit and we have to have an uprating order quite while after the chancellor have announce it in the budget the work and pensions committee recommend that the government bring these order before the house early than february so commend the government we be still in january suppose that be positive progress although do not quite know why we could not have do this in november to get that certainty hope as the year go by one year we will get some good news and the minister will say we have so many people on universal credit who we know we can uprate far more quickly but actually we can use much late inflation number because the amount of manual processing we have to do for the old benefit be much less of work demand than it use to be we could then move to use december inflation figure to bring the benefit increase much near the actual cost of live and avoid the horrible situation we have currently where we be effectively six month behind and in the meantime there have be huge spike and people can not afford to pay their bill perhaps the minister could update the house on whether we be any nearer the prospect of slightly more sensible process where we be not use out of date information to give people rise in benefit that be already six month old which expose load of risk in that situation there be also lot of noise about the triple lock be unsustainable and suggestion that we will have to get rid of it because we can not afford to give pensioner that level of increase can not think of any justification for ever give people who be reliant on state pension and who have no possibility of go back to work an increase of less than inflation it would be an intolerable situation to put people in think we have establish over many long and painful year that give pensioner less than earning be not very attractive position we have that for while before the coalition government quite rightly reverse it as one of the first thing we do when we come to power year ago do not know why we have to have speculation around the idea of take away the link to inflation or earning it be utterly impossible suppose we all wish that the be relevant consideration for we but it look like it might be few year before we have to worry about that part of the triple lock kicking in the problem be that the rise in earning and the rise of inflation have get out of step and be in two different financial year we be therefore effectively give that increase twice because we give it on inflation in year one and then when pay rise catch up in year two we end up give it again and we have accidentally give much high amount over period than either inflation or earning if that be what risk the long term future of the triple lock do the minister think that rolling two year or three year average would fix that if that be the price of make the triple lock safe in the long term would pay it would not choose it but if that stop the uncertainty over the whole thing be affordable it would be well perhaps the minister could help we with well process for future year fully support these order and will happily vote for they in the unlikely event that we get to vote it be pleasure to follow the hon member for amber valley nigel mills fellow member of the work and pensions committee stand here with somewhat renew sense of frustration follow the release of the joseph rowntree foundation uk poverty report which will refer to throughout the course of my contribution find myself again speak in this parliament against backdrop of truly dire situation characterise by destitution wonder what more can be say or do to make the british government realise the true extent of the hardship they have inflict on people across these island the snp will not oppose the order for but to keep it plain and simple the damage have already be do no amount of uprating will address the long term consequence of entrenched destitution inflict on household as result of the british government who would argue have be asleep at the wheel now for year although the government announcement to uprate social security benefit mean that shortfall should not increase any far this year the order still fail to undo any of the cumulative impact of year of cut to social security that household across these island have endure while the british government have be asleep at the wheel people across the country have be keep awake at night due to the sheer amount of stress and anxiety wonder how they will feed themselves and their family and how they can afford they often can not afford they the essential we be face with an horrendous picture but that be the stark reality of live with this westminster government young child school child pensioner young adult those in and out of work no one be leave unscathed when they have the misfortune of interact with the uk social security system as the minister come back to the dispatch box be sure full of civil service inspire line that do not meet the reality outside whitehall we be face with cold hard truth from which we can not escape people be suffer and will only continue to suffer as long as this government refuse to fix the know policy issue on which be sure my hon friend the member for glasgow south west chris stephens will elaborate we be debate what be suppose to be an adequate payment for social security the government case be completely weaken be it not by the ridiculous system of loan and reduction my hon friend constituent in glasgow east and mine in glasgow south west be on average have their universal credit payment deduct by month because of this ridiculous system pay tribute to my hon friend who be an assiduous questioner of the government through work and pensions question on the issue of debt and deduction he be right to cite the figure in glasgow which be well know local citizen advice bureaux all over our constituency refer to they but of course we be not the only member whose constituent be impact by the debt and deduction policy of this government which be often find want if the minister could touch on debt and deduction when he sum up that would be helpful in westminster hall debate hold three week ago on the cost of living crisis compare the uk social security system which use to be hail as safety net for those who need it to something that now resemble nothing more than frayed rope unable to bear the weight of the individual who rely on it as lifeline after read the new report and statistic produce by the joseph rowntree foundation have never be more assured in my assessment of the state of the social security policy enforce by this westminster government the jrf report outline that more than one in five people in the uk be in poverty in that be million people million of whom be child and million be pensioner just as the statistic from save the children and age scotland show will outline they shortly the jrf report have to be wake up call for this government and indeed the government who may follow if we be to make any tangible change to the broken system that lie before we in its report the graph that illustrate the percentage of people in poverty be break down into the follow category in poverty but not in deep poverty in deep poverty but not in very deep poverty and in very deep poverty must be honest find it completely surreal that we have reach point at which statistical analysis have to be break down into such category to illustrate the situation that people be have to endure it be utterly shameful that such category even have to exist in one of the rich country on the planet understand that to member who be present today seem frustrated but that be because be the statistic in this report be not just number they be the very reality of people in the community that represent such as parkhead and shettleston and those such as mosspark or cardonald that be represent by my hon friend the member for glasgow south west they be truly harrowing finding want to say something about universal credit which be also raise by the hon member for wirral south alison mcgovern this policy be fail the very people whom it be in theory suppose to support rather than support they it drive destitution and food bank usage it have be report that of people refer to trussell trust food bank in scotland who be in receipt of universal credit have money automatically deduct from their payment to repay debt such as dwp advance point make by my hon friend the member for glasgow south west moreover food bank in the trussell trust network distribute about million emergency food parcel across the uk in more than million of which be for child the government also refuse to scrap abhorrent policy such as the two child cap and the associated rape clause the dwp own figure show that in april last year million child be affect by the two child limit and say that in the context of those million child who be in receipt of food parcel this be in addition to datum from save the children which find that of household affect by the two child cap include at least one adult in pay employment no doubt the minister will stand up and say that the two child cap be about make sure that people get into work but the fact be that it have an impact on people who be already in work punitive sanction deduction the two child limit and the five week wait be all define characteristic that be inherent in this british government social security system policy that have cause and continue to cause hardship to so many although could stand here and generate endless amount of research and statistic for the minister my plea be simple social security do not have to be do this way we do not have to continue down this road of sanction deduction rape clause and five week wait it be an undeniable fact that the scottish government can not make any tangible change to these policy while of welfare expenditure and income relate benefit remain reserved to the government here in westminster for every step forward that the scottish government try to make westminster drag we back two the scottish government desperately need the opportunity to create system one design to tackle poverty actively and empower those who interact with the system without one hand be tie behind their back when we have have the power to do so we have introduce game change policy such as the scottish child payment analysis show that the scottish child payment could lift up to child out of relative poverty in which be because the scottish government choose to prioritise that child poverty rate in scotland sit at which be still far too high but they should be see in the context of the rate in england and the rate in wales that be likely to be due at least in part to the scottish child payment fundamentally it be political choice to lift child out of poverty if this westminster government be unwilling to make that choice simply ask they to hand over the rein of power to the scottish government who be more than willing and certainly ready to implement system that will allow people to thrive rather than be punish for their circumstance until that happen the scottish government be leave fight an uphill battle against westminster social security system that be break beyond repair again be leave wonder how different thing might be if scotland be able to take all the legislative and fiscal responsibility for these issue through the normal power of independence whether it be the british government cruel sanction regime or their refusal to fix know policy failure that only push people far into hardship we be see what will sadly be one of the define legacy of this tory government as result poverty no long just exist within our society it be deepen it be ingrain and it be cause insurmountable pain to people right across these island as we be face with the reality of more food parcel than ever be deliver through the trussell trust network and shockingly high level of child poverty the only conclusion can draw be that these be all sign of government and indeed union that the people in scotland must escape if they be to have any hope of fair and prosperous future start by welcome the uprating order include the uprating of the local housing allowance which have be freeze for over year now that be significant move forward but as my hon friend the member for wirral south alison mcgovern say we need to recognise the context in which this apparently positive uprating be be bring in we need to look at what have happen since particularly the various cut and freeze to working age support over the past year be go through some figure just before the debate start and note that between and the uprating be about between and it be year and between and it be zero of course the average annual cpi increase for each of those year be about that be the context there have be steady and consistent erosion in the value of social security and this have affect universal credit jobseeker allowance employment and support allowance income support housing benefit child tax credit work tax credit and child benefit the resolution foundation estimate at the time that this be the equivalent of cut of over billion year that be billion year take out of the support for working age people what be not well understand be that these be predominantly people in low pay work yes small proportion of people be on unemployment support or in long term unemployment but they be tiny fraction of the population this be predominantly support for people in low pay work the hon member for glasgow east david linden fellow member of the select committee mention the joseph rowntree foundation uk poverty report invite people to read it and if they can not read the whole document they should read the summary it be absolutely shocking the headline be that level of relative poverty now be equivalent to those we have before the pandemic the government prefer to talk about absolute poverty because that be to their advantage but in term of relative poverty we be back to where we be before the pandemic so that everyone understand what happen during the pandemic who be affect where be affect reflect that poverty those inequality drive who be go to get ill they drive what happen during the pandemic and now we be back there not have learn very much there be million people live in relative poverty of whom million be in deep poverty deep poverty describe people who be live on less than of median income my fellow select committee member mention another level below that very deep poverty that be even bad poverty the average income of somebody in very deep poverty be below what we recognise as the relative poverty level how on earth can we think that be acceptable in this country we hear last year about the increase in destitution which be another category altogether there be deep poverty very deep poverty and the bad of the bad destitution the number of people in destitution have double mean there be million people who can not afford to meet their basic physical need to stay warm dry and clean and to feed themselves my hon friend the member for wirral south talk about the child in the family who be affect for every increase in child poverty extra child out of live birth apologise for the fraction will not reach their first birthday that be the consequence of poverty for those who survive poverty affect every aspect of their development include how their brain be wire how they will develop and their attainment at school it be disgrace that we have such level of poverty in this country we have this debate every year and it become increasingly distressing for one of the most distressing statistic this year be the european comparison of growth rate the height of child in this country be now fall behind the height of child in europe what do that mean that be not cosmetic issue but one that concern the health of the child and their ability to flourish my right hon friend make very important point which will come on to we have talk about child but disabled people be another cohort who have be punish over the last year again that be disgraceful apologise for repeat the same phrase but can not think of adequate vocabulary to express my rage about what be happen in different term ethnic minority community be also disproportionately affect my hon friend be make deeply important speech do she agree that it be also important to consider the effect poor quality housing have on all the group she mention in particular the combination of poverty and poor quality housing which lead to action such as parent turn heat down that be very good point the department for work and pensions have the large spending across government the state pension account for the large part of the department spending follow by universal credit but third on the list be housing benefit and the support provide through the housing element of universal credit give that the government be invest large amount of taxpayer money in housing one would think there be some way to safeguard its quality my hon friend the member for wirral south make important point about the escalation in the use of food bank as have say before we do not have food bank in oldham before we now have several to meet the need we be aware of the impact of poverty on the labour market which know be of interest to the minister we need healthy labour market to be able to provide the growth we all want to see across the country but again all the evidence suggest that will not happen for the reason set out by my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell this be become an increasingly unhealthy country our healthy life expectancy be decline and our life expectancy be decline and that have be happen since at the time professor sir michael marmot warn what the consequence would be and he be right in the report that he produce at the beginning of the year ask the prime minister question about this just last week he say that if everyone have the good health of the least deprive of the population there would have be million few death in england in the period to of these can be link to austerity directly link to austerity in the first year of the covid pandemic there be further death that could have be prevent those be the consequence of the poverty and inequality that we have in this country the select committee be undertake an inquiry into the adequacy of social security support with that in mind once more commend the joseph rowntree foundation and the trussell trust which have put together some interesting recommendation on the essential guarantee they suggest that what we provide should be base on need rather than on some quite subjective view of what the level of support should be hope the work and pensions committee can support some aspect of that finally will just mention that per week for single person instead of the currently would be good step in the right direction thank you for your latitude madam deputy speaker give the number of we in the chamber do not think that this will be an afternoon of high drama like other do not intend to divide the house on the motion before we the government make their decision on uprating last year pensioner around the country let out collective sigh of relief that the triple lock have be keep no one here today will vote down either this or the next statutory instrument clearly we on the opposition benches would like the measure to go far but we know that the harm from torpedo they would be catastrophic because it would prevent the propose increase from take place none the less as the hon member for amber valley nigel mills say there be different way of do this and give that we have this opportunity to speak today will do so to allow the minister to get feel for the mood of the house how we feel the government be perform in this area and more importantly in an election year how our constituent feel that they be perform it be quite clear that the outcome of government policy be hard to swallow what we be see be woman die as they fight for compensation because of the government maladministration of their state pension and that be clearly not acceptable we see pensioner go hungry and risk illness because they can not afford to either eat or stay warm and that be not acceptable raise number of these issue relate to pension poverty in my recent adjournment debate and look forward to meet the minister as be promise to discuss some of they as member have already say we know that one in three child be live in poverty and that be not acceptable madam deputy speaker the report card be in and it be fail record number of family be rely on emergency food parcel in april to september last year people turn to food bank for the first time the hon member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams mention the joseph rowntree foundation essential guarantee find it interesting that we be here debate how much the uprating to benefit be but we never seem to debate what be the correct amount in the first place that can allow people to live in dignity and obtain their essential perhaps if people have that certainty they would be well place to improve their health and often their employment opportunity incidentally the trussell trust be on the estate today indeed madam deputy speaker think see you at the meeting and hope the minister have have the time to visit its staff in the churchill room to hear directly from they the minister and have work together on the all party parliamentary group on end the need for food bank and our inquiry report into cash or food there today learn my own statistic for north east fife have one main trussell trust food bank in cupar which until recently be ably run by joe preece he have just step down after number of year in charge those statistic show that there have be increase in the use of the cupar food bank since that be before covid the government give lot of reason about people experience pressure due to the cost of living but we all know in this place that food bank use be increase long before covid come along child poverty cost the government billion each year through immediate additional public service and the delay cost associate with the high risk of unemployment in adult who grow up in poverty that billion per year be huge amount of what be to some extent avoidable spending and find it hard to believe that we could find voter who think that let child live in poverty be acceptable if we could avoid it even if we could find that voter be pretty sure they would be horrify by the amount it be cost they the taxpayer to effectively do nothing so put it to the minister and the government that they be shoot themselves in the foot by uprating benefit with inflation while keep the two child limit and freeze the benefit cap the minister might say in his closing remark that the cap be increase last year but that be disingenuous because it have be freeze since when it be actually lower last year uprating be vital but totally insufficient in end poverty when be elect in december some family across the uk be subject to the benefit cap and now there be over the drop in number from the uprating last april will quickly vanish if the cap be freeze for another seven year indeed these be the two policy which if change would be the most effective and efficient mean of lift hundred of thousand of child out of poverty do not know for how long the minister will be in his current position we do not know when the general election will be this year and the change that might bring but what legacy it would be to take hundred of thousand of child out of poverty hope he agree with on that it would not be dwp debate for without raise the issue of unpaid carer and in particular carer allowance follow this uprating carer allowance will be each week claimable by the million carer who do hour of unpaid care each week full time work that be just per week more than when be elect four year ago for each hour of cooking cleaning bathing appointment admin and worrying an extra so yes be bring it up again be look forward to meet the chief treasury to the secretary next month to discuss carer allowance particularly the much need reform of it because believe that carer allowance create barrier to work almost half of carer receive carer allowance report that they be struggle to make end meet and if they be struggle the people they be care for be struggle too be go to end with local gripe yesterday receive letter from the dwp north east scotland service leader this follow from the department write statement six day ago about start the next phase of the transition to universal credit the letter be date seven day ago and it tell that the move to universal credit expansion into north east fife have be move forward to nine day ago two day before the letter be write three before the announcement be make by the government and over week before be actually tell mp rely on timely communication to be able to do our job to scrutinise government activity and to support our constituent very much hope that that be one off error but raise it here in the hope that future error can be prevent these order be technical necessity but when we look past that when we look past the different way of calculate inflation and the actuarial argument what we be talk about be what kind of society we want to live in during covid many find out for the first time about the inadequacy of our social security system and for those remain on it it remain deeply inadequate can not better what the hon member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams say about poverty in this country and we should reflect on that if we be pass social security uprating order because the level of poverty be an utter disgrace one have only to spend short time in food bank anywhere across the country to realise the desperation of many people who be prepared to queue often for very long time just to get few packet of pasta to keep their family together for another week the number access food bank be go up all the time people be increasingly go to community centre to try to get food that have be donate by other the level of poverty be huge will bring two specific area to the house attention the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain just talk about the first the two child benefit policy which limit universal credit to claimant first two child like all member have many constituent who be part of large family the somali community the haredi jewish community the congolese community the bengali community and number of other often have quite large family be there anything morally right in say that the third fourth fifth or sixth child in family be less valuable than the first or second can anyone justify that do not believe that they can yet the policy persist the cost of change the policy would be billion that might sound like lot it do not sound very much compare with overall government expenditure nor compare with the benefit that it would bring in lift lot of child and family out of poverty at the moment around million child be affect they come from around household interruption be the hon member for glasgow east david linden try to intervene no be just enjoy the right hon member speech the hon member be look with interest be grateful to he for that and for what he say hope that as result of this debate the minister will seriously examine the poverty create by the two child policy and that all party in this house will recognise that we ill serve the community if we deliberately discriminate against child in large family child live in poverty be less likely to achieve their full potential in school and the job and career that they want as result we all lose we all lose out on their talent because we disregard their need when they be at their most desperate hope that the minister will recognise that secondly the uprating order include an increase in housing benefit in line with the rate of inflation that be applicable the problem be that in constituency such as mine where third of the population live in the private rent sector housing benefit never quite catch up with the increase in rent impose by private sector landlord it be not just london problem it exist in glasgow edinburgh newcastle all over the country yes local housing allowance be be increase in line with perception of what the affordable rent level be within the community but it never quite catch up friend of mine be help somebody to find flat locally they spend day trawl through agent and all the other place one go to try to find flat they find few than half dozen flat available to rent within the local housing allowance in lot of inner urban area have neither rent control nor sufficient level of housing benefit or local housing allowance effectively lead to an expulsion of the poor from those community we need to come back to that and introduce private sector rent control and we need local housing allowance that be realistic and meet people housing cost otherwise it be often the poor and large family who get shift from one private rent sector flat to another thus damage those child education and life chance if we be to live in society where we be proud of our welfare state the welfare state have to work for the poor in our community at the moment frankly it do not thank everyone who have participate in this debate be very disappointed in the hon member for glasgow east david linden who seem to think that do not write my own material he should know that my private office staff be sit in trepidation as write across every speech they give in blue and red ink they never know what will emerge from my mouth can assure he that it be all my own work and he can criticise it all the more for that reason be also disappointed that people think this order be just technical necessity do not call billion of government spend technical necessity it be one of the large amount of extra spending in which the government engage in any particular year and it will make considerable difference to the life of people across the country do you want round of applause no certainly do not but would want to think that those of we in this chamber do not dismiss the order as technical measure my hon friend the member for amber valley nigel mills repeat point that think he make this time last year also make this point when be sit in the far corner of the chamber as back bencher on the timely application of these measure and whether we ought to make they more promptly after inflation be measure as member of the work and pensions committee he will know that this issue be often discuss with the discussion often revolve around the robustness of universal credit it system compare with the it system for legacy benefit be tell the hopefully promising news that state pension benefit in particular will be move to more modern it platform by follow by disability benefit contributory benefit and carer allowance so there be pathway towards get all our benefit on to modern it system that be more agile in respond to economic situation hear his point and work be under way the hon member for glasgow east and for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams both talk about the joseph rowntree foundation and be great admirer of its work as back bencher sit on many zoom meeting and team meeting to listen to its briefing the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain and have discuss the essential guarantee many time so take personal interest in what the joseph rowntree foundation say since the period cover by its report the government have provide over billion of extra support to help household with the high cost of living although understand that the joseph rowntree foundation will stick to the broad theme of its argument we need to recognise that government support have move on do not want to pre empt the meeting of the hon member for north east fife with the chief secretary to the treasury which hope will bring well news than be able to deliver from the dispatch box have hear about her letter my favourite episode of fawlty towers be communication problems which be comic classic and the tale she tell be such an example be sure my official have make note and we will hopefully follow up with clarify letter finally turn to the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn not be the minister in charge of local housing allowance be little cautious about give he more definitive answer at this nothing annoy more than when other ministers intrude on my brief without tell so it be courtesy to they nothing more the draft social security benefit up rat order will increase the state pension by in line with the rise in average earning and it will increase most other benefit rate by in line with the rise in consumer price these change commit the government to increase expenditure of billion in they maintain the triple lock protect pensioner on the low income and support those in the labour market while maintain work incentive and protect the value of benefit for those who can not work and who have additional disability need commend this statutory instrument to the house question put and agree to resolve that the draft social security benefit up rat order which be lay before this house on january be approve pension beg to move that the draft guaranteed minimum pensions increase order which be lay before this house on january be approve feel almost like netflix series in that people can now binge watch two episode of in row hope none the less that this matter be worth equal consideration the guaranteed minimum pensions increase order set out the yearly amount by which guarantee minimum pension part of an individual contract out occupational pension earn between april and april must be increase occupational pension scheme be require to increase gmp that be earn during that period and be in payment by for the financial year as this be quite technical matter will provide little background information on gmp and what they be and be not gmp be create to help make occupational pension provision more affordable and more secure as many member present will be aware the state pension use to be make up of two part the flat rate basic state pension and the earning relate additional state pension the flat rate state pension be fund through the national insurance scheme and pay the full rate to those with sufficient qualifying year of ni contribution or pro rata to those with partial record the second part of the state pension the earning relate additional state pension be link to person earning the national insurance contribution pay by both the employee and their employer give the employee the right to an additional earning relate state pension that be design to ensure that as many worker as possible be able to save for their retirement through work base pension however many employer already offer their worker company pension through their own scheme so many people be already build up an occupational pension and an earning relate additional state pension in effect replicate that provision that be consider onerous and potentially unaffordable for both employer and employee it be see as double provision and over complicated in order to simplify the situation the government of the day introduce in the system of contract out and the provision of guarantee minimum pension which be the subject of this order between april and april employer sponsor salary relate occupational pension scheme could contract out their occupational pension scheme from the earning relate additional state pension people who be member of contract out scheme be take out of the additional state pension so as result both the employer and the pension scheme member pay low rate national insurance contribution in return salary relate contract out occupational pension scheme be require to take on the responsibility for pay their member guarantee minimum pension as part of their occupational pension from the scheme the guarantee minimum pension that the member build up in the scheme would be broadly equivalent in value to the additional state pension that they would have receive have they stay in the state system the majority of employee would also have build up an occupational pension over and above the guarantee minimum pension amount but the scheme pension could never be low than that guarantee minimum the crux of the idea be that rather than pay additional national insurance to the state in order to build up an additional state pension people could build up similar amount of occupational pension through workplace pension scheme the system run in that way from to have set out the detail which accept be complicated let turn to the order before we the order provide measure of inflation protection for the guarantee minimum pension part of an occasional pension build up between april and april legislation stipulate that when there have be an increase in the annual level of price as measure the previous september the order must increase the guarantee minimum pension part of the occupational pension by that percentage or whichever be low as the september figure be the increase for the financial year will be the cap of aim to achieve balance between provide some measure of protection against inflation for member and crucially not increase scheme cost beyond what they can generally afford in order to avoid undermine the viability of some scheme and see they go into the pension protection fund an obvious question come to mind what happen when inflation be above as it be currently most member who reach the state pension age before will still get the same inflation protection for their guarantee minimum pension as if they have never be contract out that be achieve through an uplift that they receive in their additional state pension for those reach state pension age after april who be therefore receive the new state pension there be transitional arrangement in place which be particularly beneficial for people who be contract out these member will therefore still get the increase from their occupational pension scheme recognise that this be perhaps very complex and technical area but be satisfied that the order ensure that the burden place upon scheme be an appropriate one but also one that ensure that recipient get an increase in their pension that give they some measure of protection against inflation therefore commend it to the house call the shadow minister hopefully the house will be relieve to know that do not intend to repeat the explanation of this order that the minister have just give as he say the statutory instrument address the need of specific group of pensioner we support the measure and will therefore obviously support the order will just take very short amount of time to raise few other related issue far to the debate that we have on the previous order madam deputy speaker you will remember that under labour we see an historic fall in pensioner poverty unfortunately that have be rise recently which be alarming after nearly two decade of decline one in six pensioner be now live in poverty with the figure rise to one in four among those who be single hope the minister agree that britain should be one of the good country in the world in which to be pensioner so the fact that many be still spend their later year in poverty do not reflect well on we labour in power introduce pension credit ensure that pensioner weekly income reach minimum guarantee level while offer whole host of benefit such as free dental and optical treatment however as we have discuss many time across the dispatch box despite highly publicise campaign statistic release in october show that of those eligible to claim pension credit be still not do so give that be sure the minister share my concern about this matter will he confirm what more the government be do within their power to make people aware of their potential pension credit entitlement since we have just rehearse all of the argument about the cost of living think the minister might like to take moment to reflect on what more the government can do as we know social security system can not perform their most basic function if entitlement be erode by inflation or bad not take up at all far to the debate that we have just have we also need to end the speculation about uprating pensioner should not be put through that any more than anyone else should as we all know the key to good retirement start in the workplace when retirement can often seem like distant concept we need people to consider their future early on which be the logic behind automatic enrolment massive policy success start under the last labour government which have drive up the number of people save however too many people be still fall through the net in september the pensions extension of automatic enrolment act receive royal assent with cross party support give ministers the power to abolish the low earning limit for contribution and reduce the age for be automatically enrol from to at the time the pension minister the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott say we will consult on the detailed implementation at the early opportunity we have not have further information about that implementation and want to give the minister the opportunity to share any information about what be happen with those power hope that all member across this house will agree that the extension of auto enrolment be good thing and that we should crack on with it will make one final point the roll out of collective define contribution scheme which provide an income for later life while give member great certainty about retirement outcome that they could achieve be certainly to be welcome however more need to be do to ensure that the proper framework be in place for company that express an interest in cdcs while ensure that those who can still join define benefit scheme do so would be grateful if the minister comment on that very briefly the pensions minister will know because there be westminster hall debate on this couple of week ago about some of the issue experience with define benefit pension scheme with company such as bp not apply the limit that have be recommend by the trustee do the shadow minister agree that we need to ensure that company that have make promise to pensioner actually pay out be not entirely sure whether that intervention be for so will let the minister respond when he wind up however on company keep their promise that seem like one of the basic to as say before we support these measure and will not oppose the government proposal but would very much welcome the minister comment on the question have raise call the snp spokesperson when the minister be make reference to netflix series early do think that the pension uprating debate would be an unusual backdrop for netflix and chill do not know whether that be the first time netflix and chill have be refer to in hansard be at risk of get myself into trouble now so will move on quickly as with the previous order my party will not oppose this order in the previous debate focus my remark on poverty more broadly now want to speak about the number of pensioner in poverty which rise between and with pensioner on low income among some of the hard hit by the cost of living crisis the joseph rowntree foundation report which cite early reveal that million pensioner be live in poverty in the uk in with the poverty rate for single pensioner almost double that of couple pensioner and about one in six pensioner overall live in poverty know this be feel acutely in community such as carmyle and sandyhills in glasgow east end the reality accord to age scotland be that of be skip meal due to financial pressure and of people age between and be have to dip into saving to meet unexpected rise cost meet the trussell trust just this morning and it be certainly see large number of pensioner use its service than before this be of course the case for many waspi woman give that the ombudsman find that there be indeed maladministration in the communication from the department for work and pensions with the cost of living crisis certainly make matter much bad for woman bear in the be grateful to my hon friend for mention bear woman such as my constituent kathy mcdonald do he not agree that there could have be plenty of time today for we to discuss the plight of those bear woman and to see what justice and compensation we should be deliver for they my hon friend be right know kathy mcdonald one of the woman who be force of nature and do an incredible service for woman bear in the it be frustrating that we can have these debate about woman but be clear that what woman want be not necessarily word from this place but action from this place think that challenge will be put to the two main party at westminster as we come towards the election and encourage all those woman to press their candidate on the need for fair and fast compensation as well as for wide action to tackle the unacceptable gender pension gap that be so pervasive as age uk highlight the state pension be the large single source of income for most pensioner so retain the triple lock be the very bare minimum be glad to hear the comment in the previous debate from the hon member for amber valley nigel mills on that the british government must urgently address the shockingly low state pension level as they be already provide low state pension than frankly most other advanced economy relative to average earning as with the issue we face with the social security system the only way can see our bring truly able to protect pensioner and treat old people with the basic dignity and respect they deserve be through the power of normal independent nation where we can both improve state and occupational pension and set the state pension at an appropriate level within scottish context that be the most crucial point want to finish on because constituent in community represent such as sandyhills and carmyle know one thing for as long as scotland remain within this union the state pension age will continue to climb and the state pension itself will remain pitifully low lead to more pensioner be place in the invidious position of choose between heating or eat that say everything people need to know about this westminster government who the people of scotland do not vote for with the leave of the house let thank those who have respond to this debate there have be bit of speculation about uprating but do that start from those on the government benches and come from nowhere else it do not it start on the opposition benches and it be sheer political opportunism nothing more it will happen year after year just as the sun shin and the rain fall the shadow minister make some interesting point that want to try to respond to particularly on pension credit where know there be shared desire to make sure that we always maximise take up through the thing we have be try to do lately besides the television campaign we have be run involve footballer such as harry redknapp and so on every time we write to people about state pension uprating we be still legally oblige to do so to million pensioner they get piece of paper about pension credit as well we be trialle writing to pensioner on housing benefit to ask they to apply to see whether they also be eligible we have not see the outcome of that work yet be really interested to see it because it will be good indicator of whether we can use other dataset to get more people involve we be see much high claim high than year ago so lot of what we be do be generate more interest that do not always feed through to successful claim but it be show that there be more interest there be no disagreement on this point about pension credit just gently ask the minister to go back to his official and re examine the paper form for pension credit which run to some question give the nature of the demographic dealing with pension credit form there must be way of try to simplify they do he agree that it might be possible to slim down question so as to get more people their pension credit very much take the point be sit down today with people from range of charity to discuss that very point how do we get access to those who be least inclined to apply at the moment and what group in society be we miss the discussion be very much about how an overreliance on it can often be barrier and so this be very much part of our thinking the shadow minister also ask about the reform and the extension of auto enrolment invest from the first of income and so on those thing be personal priority to would love to give she date for when she will see that in due course be never good answer to give at the dispatch box but be afraid that it be the answer at this stage however be pursue this within the department so she have my personal pledge that be push it be as hard as can be also enthusiastic about cdcs as know she be she will be aware that royal mail already have scheme ready cook and be keen to see how it progress but want to make sure that other business that be also show an interest can input into the formulation of the more sustainable regulation finally come to the point about bp make by the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain unfortunately commitment give in the chamber do not always align with ministerial diary as to when be due to meet people so on all the thing promise would raise have yet to have chance to meet the pension regulator to have that fuller discussion this be still case of watch this space but stand by everything say in westminster hall and it be still on the agenda on that note commend this order to the house question put and agree to business without debate delegated legislation motion make and question put forthwith standing order no medicines that the draft human medicines amendments relate to coronavirus and influenza england and wales and scotland regulations which be lay before this

protect and restore wetland in the uk as the minister know never duck an opportunity to talk about slimbridge wetland and flamingo understand that have until tonight to talk about they and that probably would never be allow to speak in the house again if do so but could fill that time be bless to have slimbridge the headquarters of the wildfowl and wetlands trust in my constituency and to live just down the road from it tell gloucestershire live reporter this week that it seem to complete madness that previous stroud mps have never use their expertise to highlight the wwt on the national stage we be really grateful for everyone involvement we now have an all party parliamentary group for wetland and wetland be constant feature of discussion in the department for environment food and rural affairs mainly because pester everyone all the time which be great pleasure slimbridge be place that create calm allow people to walk among the most beautiful bird and wildlife learn about conservation success and challenge on the way my daughter love welly boot land year ago get no phone reception at slimbridge so use to go to hide there and it be beautiful world wetlands day on february celebrate the creation in of an international treaty the convention on wetland thank the minister for take the time to visit the slimbridge expert last week and for her advocacy on this issue also thank previous ministers some of whom be in the chamber wetland be some of the most threatened habitat in the world yet they be also the most vital for wildlife and people in the uk we have so many type of wetland from coastal habitat such as saltmarshe seagrass and estuary to inland feature such as pond lake river stream bog fen swamp marsh and peatland the severn estuary be true gem in my constituency and be key for support internationally important number of dunlin redshank ring plover black tail godwit shelduck teal pintail and another that will not even try to pronounce it be incredibly important commend the hon lady for bring forward this debate have notice in the time she have be in this house that one of her great interest be the slimbridge wetland castle espie just outside comber in my constituency be part of the wildfowl and wetlands trust as well the work carry out by the trust there be essential give that almost the entire global population of brent geese reside in and around strangford lough during the winter month that work take time and money and it need to be well support by government fully support what the hon lady be try to achieve because know that the benefit she get for stroud we will get for comber thank the hon gentleman for his intervention and would very much like to visit to see his brent geese at some stage because it be so important for conservation and awareness encourage all member to go and get their social media clip with their wetland and wildfowl the convention on wetland also know as the ramsar convention be crucial international treaty aim at conserve and promote the sustainable use of wetland the old global intergovernmental environmental agreement in the world it set the standard for international co operation on environmental action that other more high profile international agreement have follow be proud to say that the uk government be an early signatory to the convention back in the underline our commitment to the preservation of these valuable ecosystem the wwt play significant role as one of the six international organisational partner involve in the convention implementation various stakeholder include environmental non governmental organisation contribute to this collaborative effort show the importance of partnership in safeguard our wetland be grateful to my hon friend both for initiate this debate and for kindly let say word about the freshwater habitats trust whose new forest representative thea margetts meet at the volunteer fair put on by the national park authority last weekend it be amazing what these volunteer contribute not least the new forest water code and other great pointer and advice as to how we can keep these precious but delicate environment safe thank my right hon friend for that important intervention which bring alive the number of freshwater volunteer and show just how many people be grip by this environmental work really take it into their heart and run with it would say that the wetland squad be true squad goal they really do work together and with range of different people across this country and around the world ramsar site protect wetland of international importance be some of the uk most precious natural treasure with ramsar site the uk have more than anywhere else in the world these site be the equivalent of the white cliff of dover or stonehenge in their significance to the cultural identity of our nation country renowne for its wet weather thank the hon member for secure this debate in the same week as world wetlands day want to contribute some information about seaton wetland and in particular the black hole marsh before the black hole marsh be just drain agricultural field but the environment agency work with local engineering company to devise tidal exchange gate that allow in salt water to ensure the lagoon have just the right level of salinity since that be do we have see the return of the dunlin the ring plover and the black tail godwit do the hon lady think that the tidal exchange gate innovation might be replicate elsewhere the opportunity for wetland and this kind of work be absolutely endless and would be interested to hear from the minister about that there have be an extraordinary amount of investment in this work in the hon gentleman neck of the wood and elsewhere in the country it would be helpful to hear more about these opportunity and the innovation of which he speak with all my colleague in the chamber bring alive their own experience of wetland believe the uk can really celebrate world wetlands day and hold our head high because of our history and status as an early signatory to the convention if we choose to lead on this with the multifaceted environmental masterclass that our wetland represent we will be able to command immediate respect because of our history and our work so far congratulate the hon member on secure this important debate without want to sound competitive somerset have some amazing wetland and ramsar site and somerset wetlands which include the west of sedgemoor in my constituency be england large super national nature reserve do she agree that such declaration be crucial to reverse nature decline and to the fight against climate change do will come on to the fight against climate change because the hon lady be absolutely right she speak about somerset investment of million think go in for flood resilience work and there be work go on with farmer the expertise she speak to can be sell around this country and export around the world so be excited that she be able to speak so fondly of that with volunteer in mind want to speak to the current situation with our wetland send love respect and absolute hug to all the slimbridge volunteer we could not do the conservation work without they it be sad fact that for century we have not be look after our wetland there have not be that love and care that everyone in the chamber want for they staggering of our uk wetland have be lose over the past year this be not just recent thing and while the rate of decline be now slow thank to lot of the work that be go on the precious few wetland that remain be under considerable pressure they be in poor condition than we would like and we think we could do much more work will speak briefly about what we should be focus on now and in the come month would welcome renew push on four transformative step that would speed up the progress on create and restore additional hectare invite everyone in the chamber to join the all party parliamentary group for wetland and join the fight because it be crucial to achieve the net zero target would like action but will also take manifesto commitment before my hon friend come on to her priority may just set out how impressive she have be in persuade as former minister and colleague across the house of the wonderful benefit of wetland we be all more knowledgeable thank to she and the work of wwt in her constituency as well as the benefit for climate change and biodiversity do she recognise the benefit to our health our mind body and soul can really appreciate the value of spending time in green and blue space as there seem to be some competition let say that have mile of coastline and many lake wetland in the english lake district the benefit to our mental and physical health must not be underestimate wetland can be just pond and the million gardener across this great land can also play significant part absolutely right my hon friend be keen walker and get out into the environment as much as possible to be beside water be particularly tranquil experience for most people and that be certainly something wwt campaign on because we know the benefit ask the government to commit to national strategy for uk wetland most of the work have be do so let we label it as national strategy and pull it all together because the department for environment food and rural affairs be do some great work would like to see dedicated domestic wetland team at defra to ape the success of the peat team who be brilliant expert if can not have whole team will take name civil servant we can go to who really own all the different moving part because know it be in lot of different part of the defra family would like to create nutrient offset code to rebuild investor confidence in that market and to provide guidance and training for national flood management to ensure that land manager council and practitioner can take advantage of those option would like the creation of saltmarsh restoration grant scheme as have be do for peatland and to scale up saltmarsh creation through the nature for climate fund would like requirement for new development to include sustainable urban drainage system we believe schedule to the flood and water act should be enact have speak to that in this place on number of occasion as have say however plenty of very good work have be do and think we should talk about it more and perhaps pull it all together because wetland be nature secret weapon recall that when my hon friend the member for copeland trudy harrison come to slimbridge we have mic drop moment when the expert explain that wetland can store time more carbon than tree while tree take year to reach its full pace with wetland the process be instant think that the slogan for wetland should be justaddwater for environmental clout for wellbee for flood defence for carbon storage and for water quality understand that the minister will speak about some of the work that the government be do because there be an awful lot of it but think that if there have be more awareness of what be go on we would not have see the nutrient neutrality drama and some of the firefighting that ministers be have to do so much work be actually there but no one have mention it think that home builder be already get there we just need to light the touch paper and let everyone run there be great deal more that could say but you have life to get back to at some stage mr deputy speaker and know what long hour you work let just mention the powerful benefit to british wildlife think that there be too much talk of target and carbon in this place but people get specie and wildlife in the uk wetland cover only of the land but they support of its specie it be clear that we can scale up biodiversity and other support if we invest think it through and protect our wetland let say little about flood resilience the government green recovery challenge fund help project such as the wwt two valleys slow the flow which demonstrate the effectiveness of use natural flood management to stop flood pressure on property downstream that be happen in somerset but know that work of this kind be take place in local authority area all over the country let we bring it to life and end the devastating impact of event such as storm henk which we see recently let also say something about water pollutant filter know that in her previous brief the minister work extraordinarily hard on the problem of sewage and the victorian network that we be try to repair but we now know that specially engineer wetland call treatment wetland have the potential to remove up to of metal trap and retain up to of sediment run off and eliminate of nitrogen so we can use wetland to remove pollutant from water as for the point that have be make about physical wellbeing spend just minute in urban wetland have be show to yield extensive improvement urge everyone to go down to bridgwater and observe the juxtaposition of the big high rise and the wetland that have be create which people have be use throughout covid and beyond the climate change committee have stress the importance of protect and restore saltmarsh and seagrass because they be so efficient at carbon removal in the long term saltmarshe bury carbon time fast than woodland know that the government be obsess with tree because we can count they and we like thing to be measurable but there be other option let we do the tree but let we do the wetland as well the wwt have superb blue recovery leaders group of business which have back this initiative because they can see the economic benefit and want to invest in the environmental power of the country company such as aviva have invest massive amount because they can see that this stuff work for their customer for their employee and for the country and beyond in short wetland have nature boost flood busting carbon sink mood lifting water clean superpower so why be we not make more of they or rather even more of they because know exactly how much work the minister and other be do in this regard what wonderful wetland bust speech that be but expect no less of my hon friend the member for stroud siobhan baillie who be not only wonderful advocate for her constituency but particular advocate for the wildfowl and wetlands trust and as have be point out by some of our colleague for all thing wetland help to embed this subject in our parliamentary agenda she be fortunate to have in her constituency the wonderful wildfowl and wetland centre at slimbridge be bit envious but actually have the somerset level in my constituency which be itself an internationally recognise wetland so we have great deal in common thank my hon friend for what she have lay out today and for make the case for more attention for wetland will pick up many of her point but also want to convey that we be already do great deal for wetland as we have hear the term cover multitude of area from the huge internationally protect site right down to the garden pond that point be well make by the previous minister my hon friend the member for copeland trudy harrison want to talk about what we be do while obviously recognise that there be almost always more to do the importance of wetland be recognise by the very fact that people have stay for the adjournment debate which be not always the case so thank you to they these ecosystem be not just landscape of natural beauty and biodiversity they be also critical to our mission to restore nature and to hit our climate change target be go to lay out the thing that we be already do and the thing that we be work on year ago we publish our environmental improvement plan which set out the government ambition to improve the environment for the whole nation those commitment be underpin by our legally bind environment act target include our apex target to halt the decline of specie by this should not be take lightly it be globally lead target it be pretty phenomenal to have commit to set such target in law we have also commit to create or restore over hectare of wildlife rich habitat by internationally at the most recent convention on biological diversity the uk be at the forefront of effort to secure another ambitious agreement to protect of the world land and ocean by include through the conservation and restoration of freshwater habitat we have hear today about the freshwater volunteer work in the forest of apology the new forest those volunteer recognise the importance of the habitat in their area in the constituency of my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis in december we further our commitment to freshwater wetland habitat at the united nations framework convention on climate change by sign up to the international freshwater challenge we be also proud member of the international ramsar convention on wetland across the uk include the crown dependency and overseas territory we protect internationally important ramsar site that be more than any other country in the world want to add something that we have do through the environmental improvement plan and the national adaptation plan we will be establish uk wetland inventory in support of the ramsar convention this involve mapping where these varied wetland be which will inform our action to restore they improve they or add to they that will be very beneficial and it be something that many people have be call for these wetland site have receive enhanced protection that reflect their importance we have give they the same protection as our country most precious site our protect habitat site to prevent damage by apply rigorous environmental assessment our commitment in england be to get of our protect site into favourable condition by that will benefit large swathe of these wetland and much restoration work will be include in that the uk wetland represent some of our nation most precious and sensitive habitat provide wonderful place for winter and breed habitat for wetland bird we have have big list and be go to add to it see many bird at slimbridge last week the black tail godwit the curlew the beautiful bewick swan the golden plover although take issue with the wonderful guide who work there because the plover look more brown than gold but the guide say that the sun have to be shin to see the gold and the wonderful lapwing which love we use to call they peewit at home on the farm where grow up those bird be all there at the slimbridge wetland centre which must be commend for its work and the fantastic advice it give visitor regardless of their level of knowledge do not know if you be keen birder mr deputy speaker but even if you be not you would be inspire because the guide point out the most amazing bird fly in and out and fly in flock it be captivate as my hon friend have lay out natural treasure wetland habitat be incredibly diverse from blanket bog to aquatic marginal area reedbed to riverine habitat they make huge contribution and restore they be critical to hit our target we have launch landscape scale nature recovery project over the past two year half of which include wetland habitat within wilde mosaic as have be say quite lot of that money have come to somerset include some significant grant for shapwick moor and site in my constituency and that of the hon member for somerton and frome sarah dyke those grant will help to restore work out peatland which have dry out and be haemorrhage carbon by rewette they and also enable work with farmer to raise the water table to have wetter foot basically we be get back to the original state of the peatland the wetland those project be support specie recovery and building resilience against the impact of climate change in total such project cover something like hectare so significant amount be already go to restore those wonderful site we be about to announce the successful bid to our million specie survival fund grant which we launch last year range of those project will restore more habitat include wetland half of the project fund by our million specie recovery programme capital grant scheme will support the recovery of wetland habitat and specie such as the wonderful lapwing and black tail godwit as well as mammal such as the water vole and white face darter know that have spark the interest of mr deputy speaker as have be say of our specie live in wetland so it be important that we look after they and help those that be in decline our countryside stewardship scheme pay for action to create and manage reedbed and fen at the recent oxford farming conference in january as part of the new environmental land management scheme we be update these action to well reflect the cost and income forgone for all farm type to create and maintain those important habitat that have result in increase payment rate for example the previous rate of hectare for management of fen have rocket to hectare which have be extremely well receive in addition we be make these offer less prescriptive and more flexible about how they achieve the intended outcome that will help to incentivise the creation of new wetland contribute to our outcome for biodiversity water quality and net zero beyond their crucial role as home for our wildlife we recognise the invaluable ecosystem service that wetland provide include water quality and management carbon sequestration and public wellbeing all of those have be ably refer to during the debate there be even more go on than have understand return to my point about uk strategy over other country have strategy for wetland as say will take manifesto commitment but will the government be willing to look at what those other country have do lot of the work have already be do so could we make commitment to ensure that we bring together all that focus down the line that would make lot of people very happy thank my hon friend for that point we work widely on the international stage indeed some of our blue planet fund and our darwin fund go to work on wetland area internationally particularly restore mangrove and work on climate change we be already do great deal but we can always learn from other country it should be reciprocal learning process and we will continue to work like that through our plan for water which be launch last year to tackle pollution water pollution storm overflow agricultural pollution plastic pollution road run off chemical and pesticide work be go on to create wetland to help solve those problem work be also under way in number of catchment on wastewater treatment work to take out the phosphate which be affect some of the wetland therefore we be take out the nutrient but we be enable the creation of nature base solution include wetland to help clean the water as well and that be also well refer to wetland can also play an important role in reduce flood risk through natural management be talk about the creation of wetland to reduce and slow the flow of water back in september the environment agency and defra announce million of funding for improve flood resilience through these nature base solution just want to touch on sustainable drainage system which oddly be subject very dear to my heart have bang on about they since be on the back benches we be make big progress on the suds as my hon friend will know work with the department for levelling up housing and communities get suds into all our development can make such big difference basically suds be like mini wetland within our urban habitat that can take the water and the run off they have myriad advantage in slow the flow and reduce flooding which be so nature diverse have wonderful visit this week to the bentley housing development in finsbury park not very far away all around the tower block be these suds but they just look like beautiful wetland which in fact be what they be many company be already use they and we be move as government to get to that stage where suds have to be an integral part of our development wetland can play an important role in address both the cause and the effect of climate change that be why defra be fund worth of project this financial year to measure and verify the carbon storage potential of saltmarsh habitat which again be raise by my hon friend that will allow private investment to be leverage through the saltmarsh carbon code basically that mean that standard will be verify for carbon credit and for saltmarsh which will then trigger market and private finance can then be leveraged much as we do with the peatland code that be on the way and believe that be also one of my hon friend ask the nature for climate fund be aim to deliver the restoration of approximately hectare of peatland by that be an area the size of staffordshire somerset and many other area be get some of that money this represent tripling of historical average annual restoration fund for these area great deal of that funding be go to the great north bog huge area that be currently be restore the england peat action plan set out strategic framework to improve management and protection of upland and lowland peatland we must not forget that all of those area be basically wetland they be only effective wetland when they be in healthy state basically wet which be why we have to do this restoration work in the net zero strategy we have commit to the aim of restore approximately hectare of peatland in england by that be build on that hectare which be well under way and the million green recovery challenge fund have also be cornerstone in our effort and have contribute to fund range of nature base solution for climate mitigation and adaptation include riverine coastal floodplain and graze and marsh habitat that fund as many in this chamber will know be set up during covid to help with lot of the effect and to get people out into nature and the countryside but also to create skill and job and it be extremely successful we also recognise as have be mention the huge importance of improve access to both our green space and our blue space blue space obviously be nature area or space where there be water just what that mean to we have be very eloquently outlined my hon friend the member for copeland trudy harrison and other touch on this that point be very well make and it be why this government be invest great deal in access to nature which include both blue and green space through our project and commit in our environmental improvement plan to world where everyone should not be furth than minute walk from nature include wetland we be embed all this into what we do today be great day because we be one year on from the start of our environmental improvement plan and we be celebrate all the great thing that we roll out over this year for the environment although with more to do because we have framework we have plan and we have the target this be not only about government money we be drive to attract money from the private sector into all this investment in nature and nature recovery that be latent and expand market and there be significant opportunity for wetland in that space we have already stimulate investment in wetland protection and through create programme such as our natural environment investment readiness fund whose third round be launch in december that offer grant of up to to help farmer start some of these project re wet re establish wetland and find out what crop they can grow in these re wet wetland and what viable market they might be able to tap into want to thank everybody who contribute to this debate there be genuine and huge interest in wetland in parliament in every party recognise the work that my hon friend the member for stroud have do she be tremendous advocate and have listen closely to the point she have make think she admit that we be do great deal more than she realise that be because we recognise the importance of our wetland it be world wetlands day on friday and hope everyone will be celebrate people can watch my instagram with all those wonderful picture from slimbridge thank she very much again for her contribution on wetland what lovely and fascinating debate to end the day on thank you and congratulation question put and agree to house adjourn
