humanitarian law across the region which of course include israel as well as the foreign secretary underline at the end of last week will the minister reassure that september export licence ban with israel cover item that we reasonably believe could be use to breach international law in gaza will she far reassure that the remain export licence with israel largely do not cover the israel defence forces or military equipment wish to be very clear as think there be some confusion on this important point follow the september suspension there be currently no extant uk export licence repeat no extant export licence for item to israel that we assess might be use to commit or facilitate serious violation of international humanitarian law there be only one exception which be for component and the foreign secretary have explain that to the house my hon friend be right to say that most licence for export to israel be not for the idf and be pleased to be able to put that on the record for the house the footage of child catch up in the fighting in gaza be horrendous and so be the footage of those who be still hold hostage first what be the minister do to ensure the protection of aid worker in gaza and lebanon and secondly give that she have just tell we that our effort to get more aid in be not work what be she next idea where will we go from here because clearly it be not work we have

essential supply for survival be run out give the abject condition in north gaza the fact that humanitarian access be nearly non existent be unconscionable year on from the start of the conflict we be still debate restriction on the flow of aid by israeli authority what more can my right hon friend do to ensure that people who be die from hunger thirst and lack of medical care receive the attention they need can only underline the fact that the new uk government be do all that we can to get aid in as quickly as possible support trust partner on the ground to deliver life save humanitarian aid as have be mention we have agree to match up to million of public donation to the disasters emergency committee middle east humanitarian appeal that will provide life save aid include medical supply shelter and clean water to people in need on top of the support that we have release to unrwa that aid need to get to the people who desperately need it and refer to my response to an early question on that point we be use every avenue to advance that cause the image come out of northern gaza have horrify many as have the news of yet more indiscriminate bombing and many people have reach into humanity dark period for historical comparison do not know which of those be appropriate but do know that on each of those occasion we tell ourselves that this time be different yet it never be do the ministerial team realise that what they do now be what they would have do then if they do do they believe that the conversation that they be have be enough and if they do not when will they act positively to bring about ceasefire be grateful to the right hon member for his question but he must recognise that from the first day of the new government come into position we have seek to do all we can to advance the cause of ceasefire on the issue of international humanitarian law which he rightly and clearly state as an imperative we have be consistently clear as new government that israel must comply with international humanitarian law it must allow unfettered aid access our message be clear israel could and must do more to ensure that aid reach civilian in gaza we have uphold our legal requirement around that as he will have see in relation to decision take around arm export licence last month the minister of state tell the house that we could not be clear intentionally direct attack at civilian object be war crime those attack threaten civilian access to power heating and water supply impact the safety and livelihood of million of ukrainians official report september vol she be right so why be it that the government can call out putin war crime the moment they happen but they seem utterly incapable of do that when the perpetrator be netanyahu and the victim be palestinians regret the tone of the hon member question surely he can recognise that the new government prioritise do all that we can to secure the require ceasefire the government have repeatedly convey not just message but action time and again to make sure we play our part and that have be recognise internationally the change we have make around unrwa our commitment to the international criminal court and international court of justice ensure we hold to our legal requirement around arm export that be government that be commit to international humanitarian law intercept communication demonstrate that hamas be struggle to find room in their warehouse for the aid that be arrive what action will the minister take to ensure that unrwa actually get that aid to the people who need it and we accept they need it desperately when hamas be prevent it from reach the palestinian population the government be clear that unrwa play vital role in save life in gaza provide much need food and basic service and support stability in the west bank and wide region wherever there be allegation or report that there may have be unacceptable activity such as that cover in the colonna report we have state clearly to unrwa that they must be investigate it do do that with the colonna report and the uk government have support the implementation of the finding of that report we continue to discuss that in detail with unrwa so that it can operate in the manner that it be mandate to do by international law while appreciate the comment about aid do the minister condemn the ethnic cleansing and annexation of northern gaza under the general plan with aid not be allow in if so what action be be take to demonstrate the uk strong objection the uk government be extremely concerned by the situation in northern gaza this morning be discuss it with humanitarian as have be do just about every day we really see deterioration in people circumstance there in term of health and access to aid as say at the beginning of the question the fact that this month will likely see the low amount of aid since the start of the conflict be unacceptable we be deeply concerned that we have now see many people who have be displace not just once twice or three time but up to nine time we will continue to argue for the need for humanitarian access to gaza far to the answer the minister give few moment ago unrwa supply be find in the hamas leader yahya sinwar underground hideout as my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman say hamas terrorist be struggle to find warehouse space to store all the misappropriate aid when will the government review their commitment to fund unrwa and actually take action to stop the misappropriation of that aid refer the hon member to my previous response on that the uk government take any such allegation very seriously we have ensure that those be take up with unrwa and with the colonna report we see thorough investigation into the allegation some of which be prove unrwa have be take action in order to deal with they it be really important that neutrality be hold to and we as the uk have play our part by ensure that unrwa have the funding require to implement those recommendation call the shadow foreign secretary follow the removal of the international terrorist yahya sinwar and the possibility of an amnesty for those who now release the remain hostage what pressure be the government bring to bear on hamas to urge they to lay down their arm and release the hostage both of which be necessary for full unfettered access for humanitarian relief in gaza be grateful to the right hon member for raise this incredibly important issue the suffering especially of the family and friend of the hostage be indescribable the foreign secretary and the prime minister have meet with they particularly those who have uk link and have repeatedly ensure that the release of hostage must be prioritise they have articulate that message time and time again and will continue to do so until the hostage be able to return home as they must be able to do co existence be inescapable and two state solution be one day inevitable as both israelis and palestinians be here to stay just as the first intifada usher in the historic breakthrough at oslo so too britain with its deep regional connection un responsibility and brilliant diplomatic service have key role in lift people eye to very different future what discussion be the government have on this issue build on the significant effort start under the last government we do not always agree across the dispatch box but strongly agree with the right hon member characterisation of the need for two state solution ultimately that be the only way of deliver the peace and security that the people of israel and palestine deserve make sure that we play our part in exercise leadership towards that two state solution be long term commitment of this government but of course as he would expect we need to show what that can deliver huge amount of work be ongoing around reconstruction and have discuss that issue in detail with the world bank for example it have be conduct survey of the need that will have to be meet make sure that work be fully co ordinated so that we can achieve that secure future for those who be in gaza at the moment call the liberal democrat spokesperson the

now cease all arm export to israel with all due respect the hon member my county colleague urge he to look again at what state which stipulate very clearly the legal ground for that decision about arm export be clear that the restriction that have be place on arm due to that legal regime which the uk government be determined to fulfil be because the other licence be not go to be use in the manner

council resolution can restore stability and security we continue to raise these matter with the israelis at every level and will continue to do so this week unifil and un security council resolution plainly have not prevent the construction of tunnel and forward attack position by iranian proxy south of the litani river what discussion will the foreign secretary be have with the united nations to ensure that something be put in place to replace to strengthen the role of unifil and prevent aggressive action by hezbollah and its fellow traveller the first thing we have to do be get hezbollah

with great courage there have be important battlefield development in recent week when last update the house ukrainian force be one month into their remarkable offensive in kursk three month on they continue to hold russian territory ukraine strategic surprise have put putin under pressure force the diversion of some russian troop and equipment despite the increase in brutal russian counter attack and aerial bombardment they have so far fail to dislodge the ukrainian incursion it be not just in kursk that ukraine be fight back ukrainian force have launch long range attack into russian territory and on military target that be directly support putin illegal invasion in september ukraine use long range drone to attack four ammunition storage facility strike that successfully destroy thousand of tonne of ammunition and both the defensive thrust into kursk and the strategic defensive strike into russia have have an impact on the battlefield russia advance towards pokrovsk in the east putin main line of effort have be slow russian loss continue to rise since the start of the conflict russia be likely to have suffer casualty in september the average casualty rate of russians on the battlefield in ukraine each day be record high two and half time the rate this time last year as for equipment russia have now lose tank and armoured vehicle and vessel in the black sea fleet have be destroy or damage despite the incredible resilience of the ukrainians they remain under great pressure from russian force across multiple front russian troop continue to advance and to attack ukrainian infrastructure target the important port of odesa and strike energy infrastructure as we head into winter ukraine energy generation capacity have be reduce by up to two third of pre war level russian industry remain on war footing russian artillery be outfire ukraine by at least three to one and russia be recruit an additional troop this year defence will account for third of the total government budget in russia next year in concern new development it be now highly likely that the transfer of hundred of combat troop from north korea to russia have begin for north korean soldier to support russia war of aggression on european soil be as shocking as it be desperate north korea already send significant munition and arm to russia in direct violation of multiple un resolution the develop military co operation between russia and the democratic people republic of korea have serious security implication for europe and the indo pacific it represent wide grow alliance of aggression that nato and the nation must confront despite this dangerous development ukraine remain determined to fight on its frontline in the east and in the territory in kursk and president zelensky will continue to seek support for his victory plan we want the plan to succeed and we stand ready to work closely with the ukrainians and ally to help it to do so as we approach day of this war the conflict be at critical moment which be why the uk continue to step up its support for ukraine ukrainians be fight to regain their sovereign territory and to protect peace democracy and security for the rest of we in europe call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement offer my condolence and those of opposition members to the family and friend of corporal christopher gill who we understand tragically lose his life during training exercise recently we understand that he serve his country for year include in afghanistan and more recently volunteer to train ukrainian soldier in the uk have visit salisbury plain last may to see operation interflex know that we should be grateful to all our service personnel include corporal gill who have play such huge role in train the ukrainian armed force so that they can continue to fight and defend their homeland that fight go on and we continue to offer all support to the government for that as well as stand by the government people and armed force of ukraine we therefore warmly welcome the joint declaration and funding announcement but we share the government concern in relation to north korea have lose count of the many time that vladimir putin have accuse we and our ally of so call escalatory action in our support for ukraine but today we be consider the very real threat of north korean combat troop be send to support russia illegal invasion let we be in no doubt any potential agreement between putin and kim jong un to have north korean boot on the ground in ukraine at all let alone in the number that have be report would be major escalatory ratchet by putin himself after all as the secretary of state confirm russia have already procure munition and ballistic missile from north korea the transfer of those weapon in the first place be not only completely unacceptable but blatant violation of the un sanction that russia itself vote for the transfer of north korean weapon and now the threat of combat troop show weakness and desperation not strength on putin part as the secretary of state say above all this raise the question of what putin be offer north korea in return but we should not be deter and must respond we take decisive countermeasure to help constrain the transfer of weapon between north korea and russia the conservative government impose sanction on the arm for oil trade between russia and north korea include asset freeze travel ban and transport sanction the new government in turn must now respond to this late threat of combat troop can press the secretary of state to look at how the uk should respond in the round yes we need to look at the diplomatic tool we can use to disrupt co operation between north korea and russia but we also need to urgently look again both at our military aid to ukraine and at the freedom we offer it to use the munition that we supply particularly long range missile give the need to continue provide further capability to ukraine we welcome yesterday announcement that the uk will contribute billion to the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan scheme for ukraine the conservative government be vocal advocate for mobilise frozen russian asset to support ukraine we strongly welcome the additional funding when will the money be make available to ukraine and over what term the soon those fund be mobilise the well when exactly will ukraine receive the funding finally we have speak many time of the reality that we be face not just russian aggression but broad authoritarian axis that ultimately threaten the uk we have see that explicitly with iran and the red sea and now we see it come ever close to home with the prospect of north korean troop deploy in european theatre of war surely that strengthen even far the argument that the government need to deliver on their suppose cast iron guarantee to spend on defence as the secretary of state fail to answer at defence oral can once again press he to confirm that he be fight hard with the treasury to deliver clear pathway to in the budget at the end of this month be grateful to the hon gentleman for his comment about corporal gill will pass they on to his widow and make sure that his family be aware of they and of the sentiment of the whole house the hon gentleman be right about the enormous

meet colonel boardman the commander of operation interflex and the officer and soldier of scot together with instructor from kosovo australia and sweden illustrate the way the uk be lead multinational effort to support ukrainian soldier the hon gentleman be right and suspect that there be unanimity in the house on concern about the development in russia and the grow alliance with north korea and that it be unite in its determination to take the action require to respond and unite in recognise that we must do so alongside nato and other ally the hon gentleman ask about the new loan fund available for ukraine through the proceed of the interest on frozen russian asset we expect those to be available and in ukraine hand from early in the new year which will put the uk ahead of many other nation participate in the scheme on the hon gentleman final question we remain totally committed to spend on defence we must do this to meet the threat that this country face the prime minister confirm the commitment to set out clear path to in our first week in government at the nato summit in washington gently say again to the hon gentleman that the last time this country spend on defence be in under labour government and that that level be never match in any of the conservative year since call the chair of the select committee on defence welcome the announcement today of the uk increase support for funding for ukraine as part of the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan scheme the secretary of state speak about what be at stake for we all but can he say more about what discussion he have with his counterpart at the nato defence ministers meet about the need for they to substantially increase their support far to our prime minister recent meeting with the us president what update be there on the use of storm shadow missile by ukraine welcome the new chair of the select committee who believe now have committee to chair look forward to an invitation to give evidence and to discuss these issue with the committee soon at the nato defence ministers meeting there be unanimity among the nation that the important commitment that nato nation make in washington particularly to the billion of extra support for ukraine must be deliver there be recognition too that pledge make must be pledge deliver one of the ukrainians strike concern be that just third of the equipment and support pledge have so far be deliver so there be determination to step up not just what we can provide but how quickly we can provide it that be something that as new government we do from day one on storm shadow only putin benefit from discussion about this there be no single weapon that have turn the tide of any war whether it be artillery ammunition armoured vehicle or missile the uk provide support to ukraine to pursue its un right to defend its territory and its people call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement liberal democrats welcome the new measure announce today to use the profit of frozen asset for ukraine that billion will be of immense value to our ukrainian ally as they seek to repel putin illegal invasion not least follow the alarming news that north korean troop be currently be train in russia to fight in ukraine but we must go far fast russia must not and can not succeed some billion in frozen asset remain lock up in our country we urge the government as we have do for year to seize those asset and repurpose they for ukraine right away will the secretary of state commit to do so be he have conversation with our democratic partner to that effect with the us election fast approach it be deeply worry that our commitment to our ukrainian ally be uncertain second trump presidency could have devastating effect on the security of europe and of ukraine so we urge the government to seize these asset now so that we can support ukraine come what may we must lead with europe on this the eu country between they have close to billion worth of frozen asset will the secretary of state consider convene an urgent summit with european counterpart to begin that process do he agree that if the us can not europe must in fairness to the conservatives when they be in government and to the hon lady party before the election we be all unite in the effort to get the interest draw down from the frozen russian asset put into ukrainian hand the uk government before the last election and since have be lead this work these be practical step that we can take now whatever declaratory position the hon lady want to adopt about seize russian asset this be valuable additional funding that from the new year will be in the hand of the ukrainian government to spend on in the uk case the military aid that they need that come in addition to all the other increase that we have put in place since the election hope that despite the hon lady call for go very much far she will recognise how significant this move be and recognise that the uk be among the first of the nation to move on this hope she will give this house her full support when we introduce the primary legislation that will seek the parliamentary spending authority to provide this financial assistance in pursuance of bilateral agreement that we will strike with ukraine over how to do it when this government say that our support for ukraine be absolute we mean it my right hon friend refer to the recently sign defence export treaty between the uk and ukraine which will support ukraine defence industrial base while help to replenish our own stockpile as far as he be able will he update the house on the treaty progress be proud to sign that treaty which mean that ukraine can draw down the export credit cover and contract with uk company it be also framework that like some other framework the uk have put in place other nation and their company can use to deal with the difficulty that many face in contracting with ukraine the ukrainians will use it for contracting and procure munition and ammunition it will allow we to step up not just the provision but the production of essential military aid to ukraine welcome the statement but the bbc report that the money will be pay not in one go but in tranche over time we have the budget next week will the secretary of state assure we that give that the money be what accountant would call an exceptional item it will in no way be include in the overall defence budget next week or attempt to bolster or bump that up there be rumour of cut so will the right hon gentleman assure we that the money be one off that will be treat completely differently in the red book can give the right hon gentleman that assurance the money be one off it be additional and separate and it will be account for and set out separately in the treasury documentation its significance be that it be loan to ukraine that ukraine will not have to pay back because it will be service by the interest on the frozen russians asset he ask whether the sum will be pay all in one go it will be make available soon in the new year and the ukrainians will be able to draw it down as they need it for the purpose that they determine welcome my right hon friend comment about north korea and the grow alliance of aggression that need to be confront hope that we will have strong response to that also welcome the extra billion my right hon friend make the important point one of many that the ukrainians be be outgunne three to one in artillery by the russians although the additional support be vital how quickly can we ensure that we get extra munition artillery and missile from the alliance and the to ukraine we can get that into the hand of ukrainians as soon as it be available for that purpose announce the new contract to produce short range air defence missile the lmms lightweight multirole missile in the uk the initial contract be for and they will be in the hand of ukrainians from the beginning of next year we hope to step that up during the course of where other nation be ready to make available the weaponry that ukrainians need the establish arrangement for get it into the hand of ukrainians be in place it be question not of how but of how quickly the delicious irony of the interest on kremlin kleptocrat ill get gain be use to fund the resistance against russian aggression will not be lose on member across the house welcome what the defence secretary have say in its entirety he will know well than any of we the crucial importance of the nato alliance machinery in assist ukrainian resistance give that one recent former american president and one current french president have both make disobliging remark about the nato alliance in the fairly recent past will the secretary of state reassure we that at least president macron be now fully on board with the alliance and france important contribution to it will indeed at no point during the two day of nato defence ministers talk be there any indication of the sort of view that the right hon gentleman suggest that some in america may hold or that president macron might have previously express indeed in the good bilateral meeting that have with the french minister for the armed forces sébastien lecornu it be clear that the french commitment to support ukraine be as strong as the uk be glad to say that the determination of the french to work more closely with we on security and defence be equally strong welcome the statement and the announcement of further funding to ensure that we sustain the pace with which we be provide aid to ukraine and that we energise our own logistical enterprise what action be my right hon friend take to boost uk defence industrial production to support the ukrainian armed force and defence supply chain throughout the uk my hon friend know this territory as well as anybody else in the house he will know that over the day the uk government have change fundamentally the way in which we go about procure what be require british industry have respond magnificently to that it have be able to respond more quickly innovate more rapidly and devise what it can produce to meet the need that ukraine say it have on the frontline the uk government task be to be the middle man to ensure that that can happen at great volume and speed we will continue to do that do the government think that ukraine be win or lose be not sure whether the hon gentleman be listen to my statement but make it clear that this be critical period in the conflict ukraine be under huge pressure especially on the eastern front but it be fight conduct counter offensive and put putin under pressure the only conclusion that the nation draw from the discussion in brussels confirm by the nation in naples be that now be the moment when ukraine ally must step up our support put ukraine in the strong possible position to withstand the russian onslaught and put pressure on putin military economic and diplomatic response welcome the statement which be good news for ukraine do my right hon friend agree that ukraine be the frontier of war with the kremlin that international support be now more critical than ever and that we must be absolutely clear that defence of the uk begin in ukraine my hon friend be right her very word be speak by several defence ministers in brussels defence of the uk and of europe start in ukraine ukraine be fight for the same value and for the rest of we in europe in sharp contrast to the presence of the united nations secretary general at putin summit in russia which send out all the wrong signal this statement be hugely welcome so thank the secretary of state far to the question that the chairman of the defence committee ask be it not now time that not only storm shadow but all the matériel supply to ukraine by the western alliance should be use by ukraine in the manner that it see fit we provide ukraine with the weaponry and support to defend its country freedom and people there be consistency in that and there be no bar to ukraine strike russian military target so long as that be consistent with international humanitarian law and part of the proper defence of the country speak about the long range drone and the successful attack they have be make defensive attack but nevertheless on military target in russia it be for the ukrainians to determine how good to defend their country and we will support they in whatever way we can warmly welcome the billion of aid announce today it be great news for those fighting for democracy in europe and day of low morale in the kremlin it be fantastic the ukrainians might well use some of the money to continue to innovate at pace every few week they create new cutting edge and adaptive technology to use in the fight against putin will we learn from our friend in ukraine and ensure that we as country invest in our own small and medium sized defence enterprise so that we can have the same output in the future while there have be no change in the basis on which we provide military aid to ukraine there be change in the approach we take not just to provide aid but to produce some of the military equipment and ammunition our challenge now be to take the lesson of what we have demonstrate can be do to support ukraine to equip our own force well to fight in the future thank the secretary of state for his statement its content and for advance sight of it the additional funding for ukraine be very welcome but it be what matériel they turn the funding into that will have the effect on the battlefield that we wish to see with the shell production of european partner still well short of million unit per year will the secretary of state indicate how uk shell production have grow either in numeric or percentage term if he can not share that with the house will he give we an assurance that it be increase can absolutely assure the hon member that it be increase have already speak about the production of short range air defence missile the lmms which be increase to meet what the ukrainians need the ukrainians be clear that air defence system and long range drone be the thing that matter most to their defence and to their ability to put russia properly under pressure warmly welcome today announcement of an additional billion in financial support for ukraine generate by frozen russian asset will my right hon friend say little more about the concern development of north korean soldier support russia war of aggression on european soil and how that underline the importance of we use every tool in our box to support ukraine effort regret to say to my hon friend that be not in position to give the house any more detail about that suffice it to say we be watch and monitor this extremely closely we and the house have detect grow co operation between north korea and russia and between iran and russia at least over the past month it be sign not of strength but weakness on putin part but it introduce dangerous new development both for ukraine and for wide european security welcome the defence secretary recognition of president zelensky victory plan and his support for that but he will know that part of that plan be the use of long range missile get his point about long range uk drone be use only for military target in russia and within the norm of international rule of law but detect perhaps from his answer to two question on long range missile that he be edge towards position where he might publicly declare that ukraine can have the freedom to hit military target in russia use long range missile that will change the war and have an impact we have step up the support we provide to ukraine but there have be no change in the basis on which we provide that support to ukraine thank my right hon friend for his statement and his clear personal commitment it be very expensive for putin to fight this war but he be get lot of money from the sale of oil there be real concern that british firm or firm with british connection be facilitate and enable the illegal oil trade what more can be do in co operation with the foreign secretary to ensure that sanction be more effective against the russian oil trade my hon friend be right it be not just that we can confirm today that we be make the additional loan money available to the ukrainians it be also important to remember that the sanction themselves be responsible for freeze at least billion that russia would otherwise be able to use to feed its war machine the uk government and other have take step on the shadow fleet the shipping in the grey zone try to avoid sanction but wherever we have the evidence require to act and sanction we will do that and we will continue to do that not only be full battalion of north korean soldier set to be deploy to assist russia in ukraine but putin be benefit from component and weapon provide by the iranians and the chinese this all represent an unprecedented conflation of threat to global security echo the question ask by hon friend the shadow defence secretary the commitment to invest of gdp be right but when will that be back up with action the right hon lady be right we totally condemn north korea involvement and support for russia from arm transfer to any further development as say in my statement that be in breach of multiple un resolution and we continue to watch the situation will the secretary of state join in pay tribute to the uk armed force who be provide vital support to our ukrainian ally and to the ukrainian armed force who be fight valiantly against putin unlawful invasion of ukraine will indeed have have the privilege of visit interflex training course four time now think visit the second ever course at salisbury plain it be deeply move to see the level of commitment of british force to the task of train the ukrainians and to spend time with those ukrainian recruit they be lorry driver bank clerk pr executive of all age who have volunteer to fight for their country and their freedom they be train by british force now with those from other country alongside they who be equip they to be able to fight for their country know that they will soon return to the frontline in their own nation be deeply sobering very much welcome this billion but have the defence secretary have the opportunity to study the national audit office report publish last month into the impact of our operation in ukraine particularly operation interflex on the availability of the defence estate for the training of unit of the british army while that be acceptable in the short term in the long term it probably be not what impact assessment have he carry out and what proposal do he have to make available the defence estate we need to train british soldier nothing will shake our commitment to continue the interflex training programme we be determined and we will continue that throughout many of the partner country that have be alongside we this year have already commit to do that again next year the right hon member ask about interflex the defence estate and the training of ukrainian soldier that will continue on the national audit office report have indeed read that report it be welcome change from the normal run of national audit office report into the ministry of defence that we have be use to in recent year it praise good deal of what have be do by the ministry of defence in support of ukraine and it be very welcome thank the secretary of state for his very welcome statement he mention the importance of the ukrainian force effort in the black sea against the russian black sea fleet and how important that be to the ukrainian economy could he go little far and describe how this funding for ukraine will help to ensure that security and perhaps go even far in the black sea the principle behind this funding be that we put it in the hand of the ukrainians the ukrainians be in the good position and must be in the position to decide how good to use it we have say that they can use it entirely on military support if they choose to do so the support that they choose to procure with it will be matter for they in discussion with we be the defence secretary able to share with we any conversation that the foreign secretary have while in china about china engagement in this situation and particularly its willingness to bring to bear the influence that it undoubtedly have on both russia and north korea happily can indeed the foreign secretary be in china on and october he meet his counterpart the foreign minister and talk about the area on which our country may disagree include on russia illegal invasion of ukraine he also raise the uk concern over china supply of equipment to russia and to russia military industrial complex too very much welcome today statement from my right hon friend the secretary of state it provide evidence not just of warm word but of real practical support for our ally in its desperate hour of need but this country can not do this on its own can he update the house on any discussion that he or his ministerial colleague have have with our friend in the rest of the on combat putin through economic measure can indeed do so come away from the meeting in naples and from the meeting of nato defence ministers in brussels reinforce in my view that there be determination not just to stand with ukraine now but to do so for as long as it take will send my hon friend copy of the communiqué from both meeting think he will be encourage as be by the degree of unanimity and determination not to allow putin to believe that if he hold out the west will give up welcome the announcement of the acceleration loan scheme also welcome the timing the british government be not simply wait to see the outcome of the us presidential election as some other government be do will the defence secretary repeat the assurance he give in the house last week that regardless of us policy military aid to ukraine from european nato nation will not decrease next year we be determined on the contrary to maintain and step up the military aid require from the uk find similar determination from defence ministers across the nato nation we recognise that the ukrainians be not only mount this fight for themselves but wag it on behalf of we all and the value that we share with they thank the secretary of state for this additional billion for ukraine which will find strong echo from the hundred and thousand of individual across this country who have open their door to ukrainian refugee and in many charity and organisation such as jeeps for peace in scotland which send direct aid by take pick up across europe to the frontline do this money and the individual support from britain not show that we will stand with ukraine for as long as it take be grateful to my hon friend for his thank but those thank should really go to the chancellor because the treasury have lead the work on ensure that we can put in place this new system of loan and make this additional money available to ukraine he be completely right to say that part of the strength of the support that we can offer as country to ukraine rest on the strength of the support of the british people the warmth they have show from the outset for ukrainian refugee and the determination of many group such as the one he cite which have be willing to collect and in some case transport support for ukraine and its people out to the country itself pay tribute to their effort it be concern that we have receive only the brief of update in this house on the direct involvement of north korean troop after one week of it be widely report in the medium last week during defence question the right hon gentleman give his full throate support for ukraine but make no mention of the government awareness of the potential deployment of north korean reinforcement up to brigade strength what be the government current assessment of the scope of north korean involvement and how do overt north korean boot on the ground in ukraine necessitate change in our posture have just give the house the assessment of the involvement and the extent at present of the involvement of north korean troop give the potential of north korean boot on the ground join iranian drone in the air above ukraine it seem clear that the calculus that russia be operate to be very different from that of the western alliance do the secretary of state agree that there be risk that when the fear of escalation be one sided that itself become escalatory therefore while welcome the additional support that he have announce today wonder whether he will join in say that it be time for other country to follow the lead that the uk have show today wherever there be sign of the breaching of un resolution and sanction or of dangerous escalation in support of russia we will act we have act before my hon friend be right to point to the grow alliance between russia and iran and between russia and north korea thank the secretary of state for his statement and indeed for his very welcome news everybody in this house be incredibly pleased with the government decision today as the us election draw close and uncertainty grow over the level of support that will come from the us after that election do the secretary of state agree that ministers or members of this house must exercise caution when express an opinion on that presidential race ask that with great respect will he take the opportunity to reaffirm the strong and resilient view of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland that we should stand against russian aggression and support those who need our help through aid weaponry and diplomacy the hon gentleman be right the us election be for the us people as uk government and uk parliament we will deal with whoever the american people choose to elect as their president be glad that he welcome the support that the government have step for up ukraine say to he and to the house think the shadow defence secretary will recognise this that it make the job of the uk government so much easy when there be such united support in this house for what we must do to support ukraine for as long as it take warmly welcome my right hon friend statement would not expect he to comment on the us presidential election but naturally there be nervousness about the policy of future us government which make what european partner and ally do even more important there be huge disparity in the aid be provide by different partner across europe denmark have be phenomenal in provide of gdp or more than billion and other country such as spain have not provide so much can he assure we that there be robust discussion in private among his defence minister colleague in brussels yes can there be discussion which be about the level of commitment we must make collectively to ukraine and the level of commitment we must make collectively to nato welcome the fact that this year of the nato nation will meet that of gdp threshold it be bare minimum there be more that we need to do particularly as european nation in nato in the year ahead warmly thank the secretary of state and the full ministerial team for their hard work mobilise the additional money from frozen russian sovereign asset hope that other country will follow uk leadership on this in mobilise every tool across the government and with winter approach may ask the secretary of state to continue the push to realise the asset from the sale of chelsea football club the billion from roman abramovich that could go towards humanitarian need which be also increasingly urgent in ukraine the government understand the case that my hon friend make the minister of state my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty meet he last night to discuss this far on visit to kiev with parliamentary colleague last month see at first hand the incredible bravery of the ukrainian people who will welcome this statement unfortunately russia war machine continue to be power by western make semiconductor that be smuggle into the country may ask the secretary of state what work the government be do to make sure that russia do not get access to that technology one of the government great asset be my hon friend the minister of state because of the work that he do with many other country whenever discussion be require or evidence be gather he speak to many of the country that may find that they have within they company that might be involve in those supply chain wherever that happen my hon friend be on it and he be lead the charge to ensure that where we can identify those supply chain we take the action that be necessary to close they down thank the secretary of state for his very welcome statement as we approach day since russia illegal invasion of ukraine it be increasingly clear that ukraine survival depend on the west increase its manufacture of munition can my right hon friend say little more about boost our defence industrial supply chain include in the west midland where defence manufacturer be keen to contribute my hon friend be right the importance of the british defence industry be not just in the great security that it give we as nation but as part of the economic boost that will drive growth in future one feature be pleased to see at the recent government investment summit be the confirmation that defence would be one of the eight economic growth sector that would receive priority policy focus and support as we develop that for the future that be in the interest of ukraine immediately and it be in our own interest in future it be how we can combine both the strengthening of our national security and the boost to our national economy sentencing review and prison capacity with permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement on how the government will address the crisis in our prison not just today but for year to come the house have hear recount my inheritance as lord chancellor before the crisis in our prison be believe the great disgrace of the last conservative government they leave our prison on the point of collapse situation that would have force we to close the prison door cancel all trial and force the police to halt arrest crime would have go unpunished victim would never have see justice do and we would have witness the total breakdown of law and order the previous prime minister know he have to act his lord chancellor beg he to do so but instead he call an election as announce to the house on july we have no choice but to bring forward the release point for some prisoner some of those serve standard determinate sentence have see the custodial element reduce from to spend the rest of their sentence on licence they can be recall to prison should probation staff judge that necessary to protect the public as we see over the summer of disorder these release could not come soon enough after the august bank holiday we be leave with few than space in our man prison the system be only hold together by the heroic work and considerable good will of our prison and probation staff we be on many occasion just one bad day from disaster today the second tranche of emergency release take place create desperately need space in our prison but that be not the long term solution will now set out the long term plan for our prison which will ensure that never again be lord chancellor place in the invidious position that be on take office this must begin by build more prison for all their rhetoric the last conservative government record on prison building be abject they like to mention that between and they build place what they be less keen to admit be that in the same time they close in year they add just place to our prison capacity in our first day this government be already close to match that the previous government promise to build new place by the but by the time they leave office they have build only they be simply too terrified of their own back benchers who support prison building vociferously as long as those prison be not build anywhere near they this government will build the prison that the last conservative government promise but fail to deliver in seek lasting solution to our prison crisis we must be honest in way that my predecessor be not we can not build our way out of this problem every year our prison population grow by around prisoner this be question of simple mathematic to build enough prison to meet this demand we would have to build the equivalent of hmp birmingham which be in my constituency of birmingham ladywood four and half time over every single year to put that in context in the past year the last conservative government build just three prison while we will speed up prison building and build as fast as we can that pace be simply impossible for that reason if we be to address our prison crisis we must be smart about who receive prison sentence let be clear there will always be place for prison and there will always be offender who must be lock up but we must expand the range of punishment we use outside prison and consider how we punish those offender who have break our rule but be not danger to society for that reason today be launch review of sentencing it will have one clear goal to ensure that we be never again in position where we have more prisoner than we have space in our prison the review will follow three principle first sentence must punish offender and protect the public for dangerous offender prison will always remain the answer punishment and public protection will be the government first priority there be some offender whom will task the review with consider such as prolific offender who account for just one in every individual but nearly half of all sentence some of they be hyper prolific offender commit hundred of crime will ask the reviewer to consider whether long sentence might punish they well and force they to engage with rehabilitation on the inside the second related principle of the review be that sentence must encourage offender to turn their back on crime we need both stick and carrot will be encourage the reviewer to learn from other who have succeed in texas for instance republican legislator face problem similar to our soar prison population sky high reoffende rate and prison that have run out of space work across political divide the texans introduce system of good behaviour credit where well behave prisoner could earn time off their sentence by engage in rehabilitation programme the result be remarkable crime fall by nearly third reach the low level in half century the prison population fall by over and after two decade the texans have close prison rather than build new one the third principle of the review be that it must expand the punishment that offender receive outside of prison there be already way that we severely constrain offender limit their freedom outside of prison those under home detention curfew be in practice under form of house arrest with tag on their ankle and sensor in their home they be place under curfew generally for hour each day should they break that curfew they can be pick up and if need be lock up in some way punishment outside of prison can be even more restrictive than prison it be sad fact that in many of our prison today drinker can all too easily procure drink on sobriety tag however with their sweat measure every minute and compliance rate their teetotalism be almost as strict as mine all of that be just use the technology that be immediately available to we and use already in this country will be invite the reviewer to consider the technology they have available to they now and the next frontier of technology use in other country but not yet in our believe that the modern world present we with the opportunity to build prison outside of prison where the eye of the state follow prisoner more closely than any prison officer can move punishment out of prison for those who can be safely manage there have huge benefit outside of prison offender can engage in work that pay back the community and individual whom they have harm the evidence be abundantly clear that those who serve their sentence outside prison be far less likely to reoffend that cut crime with few victim and safe street and reduce the huge cost to society of reoffende most recently value at over billion year this government believe that crime must have consequence and criminal must be punish we also believe in rehabilitation that those who earn the right must be encourage to turn their back on crime this government believe in prison but we must increase the use of punishment outside of prison too the sentencing review will be task with pursue those goal be pleased to say that the review will be lead by former lord chancellor david gauke highly regard minister who serve in multiple role across government he have rightly gain the respect of both the judiciary and the legal sector as well as many within this house will work with he to assemble panel of reviewer who will draw together deep expertise and experience in the criminal justice system the review will take bipartisan and evidence base look at an issue that have for far too long be political football boot around by both side david gauke will report back with his recommendation in the spring and have place copy of the complete term of reference of the review in the library of the house it be right that the review be give time to do its work as have note already however the capacity crisis in our prison have not go away when we introduce emergency measure we believe that they have buy we about year but after the summer of disorder the next crisis could be just nine month away for that reason announce last week an extension of the sentencing power of magistrate court which allow we to bear down on the remand population in our prison but we must go far while will not countenance any further emergency release of prisoner there be operational measure that will lay before the house in the month ahead the first which have already reference be home detention curfew this modern form of house arrest curtail freedom and help offender turn their life around offender be subject to electronically monitor curfew which must be impose for nine hour day be generally hour long and can extend to hour as the shadow lord chancellor note in the house in february the reoffende rate for the average prisoner which be measure few year ago be close to but for offender release on home detention curfew it be this government will soon extend the use of that measure follow in the footstep of the previous administration who rightly expand its use on number of occasion we will increase the maximum period that eligible offender can spend under house arrest from six month to month the second measure that we will introduce will address the soar recall population which have double from to in just six year risk assess recall review be power of the secretary of state to re release on licence those who pose low risk to the public avoid the long wait they often face for parole board hearing in the past the measure be use often it be use between and time each year between and but its use have fall in recent year reach as low as time in later this month intend to review the risk assess recall review process so that low risk case can be consider for re release after they have be recall to prison for two to three month and where their further detention be no long necessary to protect the public should note that this will only change the case that can be consider for release with the final decision still in the hand of experienced probation officer and manager the final area where intend to make progress be in the case of foreign national offender share the public view that with in our prison there be far too many foreign offender in this country cost each year to house at his majesty pleasure it happen to be my personal view that deportation be as good punishment as imprisonment if not well we be currently on track to remove more foreign national offender this year than at any time in recent year but will now be work with my colleague across government to explore the way that we can accelerate that far include work with the home office to make the early removal scheme for foreign offender more effective when walk into the ministry of justice for the first time as lord chancellor just over three month ago encounter prison system on the brink of collapse it be the result of the inaction of the last government who think they could dither and delay and lead we to the precipice of disaster but their failure be long in the making they fail to build the prison place this country need and they fail to address the challenge of an ever rise prison population in july this government take action to avert immediate disaster but the plan that have set out today do more than that it will ensure that this government and our successor be never force to rely on the emergency release of prisoner again measure over which have no choice one that take despite my personal belief and one that must never happen again commend this statement to the house as always be grateful to the lord chancellor for early sight of her statement and for she come to the house to deliver it give we the opportunity to ask question she be always unfailingly courteous in her dealing with this house the lord chancellor make several announcement today it be important that we see the detail of her sentencing review and that whatever the outcome it ensure that victim voice be hear throughout that the bad offender for example violent or sexual offender stay behind bar for long and that as she allude to prolific offender who cause so much blight and harm can still be subject to custodial sentence where appropriate we see an overall fall in reoffende since under the last government from around to just over but there be of course still more to do it be right that we look at all sentence include tough community sentence through the prism of what reduce reoffende boost rehabilitation and good protect the public with that in mind know david gauke well he be my first boss as minister he be decent honourable able and thoughtful man and regard he as friend so will not prejudge what he will conclude in his review but the opposition will rightly as the lord chancellor would expect scrutinise the review when it be publish and hold the government to account on the choice they make on how to proceed subsequently hope the review term of reference might include not just male prisoner but female prisoner and female offender build on the female offender strategy that david gauke and put in place many year ago as the lord chancellor have set out prison capacity have be under significant pressure for some time and while the situation be incredibly acute in and it remain significant challenge that be due to an increase average sentence length for first offender for which we make no apology match by the big prison build programme since the victorian era with thousand of additional place build while tackle the legacy of the crumble prison estate we inherit in and the labour party absolute failure to build the titan prison place it promise while in government of course though the impact on the remand population of the decision to not mass release during the pandemic and to rightly retain jury trial compound by the bar strike undoubtedly significantly increase pressure despite our prison build programme the lord chancellor have set out her choose approach with more convict criminal release today at the point of their sentence rather than the point in tranche of we be see significant level of concern from victim of crime about that approach sky news run powerful package this morning highlight that concern so have several important question on that aspect of the lord chancellor announcement she say that she will publish datum on in the come week in the normal run of statistic understand that but we would be grateful if she could provide the date on which those statistic will be publish in the medium this morning she allude to the rate of recall be very high but dispute base on her internal datum that it be as high as as be suggest on radio can she expand on what that rate look like in response to write question from the under secretary of state for justice the hon member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin acknowledge that hotel be now be use in some case to accommodate release prisoner under in the light of the lord chancellor commitment at oral question last month to be transparent about this matter although it take write question from to get that confirmation how many hotel room or place be be use and at what cost we have hear little thus far about deport fno so be pleased that she have focus on that issue in her remark but when will she set out more detail of her plan to improve the deportation rate of fno and what target be she set for that do the lord chancellor now acknowledge that as we point out at the time and as victim also point out although the government claim that domestic abuse and domestic violence offence would be exclude from that be simply not the case da offender commit actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm be not exclude will she revisit the exclusion list to review this matter will she also commit to build more prison over and above the six new prison that we fund and have already be complete or be be build and will she commit to funding that additional prison building home detention curfew will far reduce the time that convict criminal spend behind bar someone with four year sentence who be not exclude from would now be out at around month with the possibility of month hdc that could mean that they be only inside for just over six month of four year sentence recognise that the interaction between different scheme and calculation be complex and may be different in individual case but can the lord chancellor reassure the house that fix minimum percentage will always be serve by those sentence to prison the lord chancellor will appreciate that with layer upon layer of reduction some people will struggle to see that punishment or public protection be at the fore so can she clarify number of further point while most da offence would be presume ineligible for hdc that presumption be not absolute and again many common da offence such as abh or common assault be not presume ineligible what will the lord chancellor do to address that issue do she intend to examine the list of exclusion for both scheme and hdc and come back to the house with tough list tagging be vital part of hdc but while there may be the tag as she have mention it appear that the ability to fit they swiftly be sadly lack at present what reassurance can the lord chancellor give that there be now no backlog at all in tagging what step be she take to ensure that victim be contact when perpetrator be release and what additional resource be go into victim support service and probation over and above what we have already commit to turn to the rehabilitation activity requirement it be right that experienced staff judge these case as the lord chancellor know the small number reflect both risk assessment and the complex interaction of rar with other release scheme therefore fear that the bounty she might expect to get from the change she intend to make will be limit will she confirm detail of those propose change for the house in due course finally and most importantly as press the lord chancellor on last week it be vital that the criminal justice system be not subject to flat budget or bad cut in next week budget cut that would let down victim those who work in the system and the public fully appreciate that she will not be able to prejudge that budget either at the dispatch box or in the medium but fair financial settlement alongside her set out her long term plan for the system little of which acknowledge we have see today will be absolutely essential if victim and the public be to have confidence in her government on law and order thank the shadow lord chancellor for the courteous way in which he have approach this debate and for his detailed question let start with his point in relation to the sentencing review the voice of victim will be hear there will be representative with experience of work with victim to make sure that be cover in the review and look forward to announce further member of that review panel over the come day the review will be free to consider every aspect of the sentencing framework include the use of whole life order and minimum sentence we have not constrain the sentencing review in any way the review panel should take proper look at the sentencing framework that we have and go where the evidence take they acknowledge the progress that be make on reduce reoffende but as the shadow lord chancellor accept there be much more to do we know that of offender be reoffender and that of those sentence to custody be reoffender we have big problem with that revolving door in and out of our prison as country that be significant challenge that we must overcome as say will be place the term of reference in the house of commons library the shadow lord chancellor will be pleased to see that those term of reference refer to cohort of offender include female offender he will also know that in my conference speech in september lay out different approach to how this government deal with woman in our prison follow it closely know that the shadow lord chancellor follow it closely be set up woman justice board which will report with strategy in the spring we need to do more with female offender especially give the impact that the incarceration of woman and the breaking up of family home have on their child particularly as two third of woman in prison be there for non violent offence hope there be cross party consensus in this house on deal with woman offender differently on prison capacity say gently to the shadow lord chancellor that we can trade number across this dispatch box about thing that the last labour government do before or he might want to acknowledge the failure that take place over his government year in power he know that only net prison place be add by his government over those year and that the crisis that face when walk into the department be acute he know that because he have walk out of that same department only few day before the previous government run our prison boil hot for far too long so my inheritance when take over be dire leave with no option other than the emergency release of prisoner note the shadow lord chancellor point about domestic abuse and domestic violence case but remind he that his own early release scheme that his government implement for many month before the last general election the so call end of custody supervise licence scheme contain none of the exclusion he know that he also know that we pull every lever available to we within the law to exclude the offence that be most closely connect to domestic abuse and domestic violence as matter of law it be only possible to exclude offence type rather than offender have have to pull that emergency lever have seek to do so in the safe way possible to make as many exclusion as possible and to give the probation service the time it need to prepare for this measure and to make sure victim be notify under victim notification scheme in the usual way will be publish the datum in relation to tranche and release in two ad hoc statistical release before christmas so that datum will be in the public domain as the shadow lord chancellor will know from his time in the department the recall rate usually hover between and can vary quite bit between those number our current information be that the release be not show high recall rate than we would expect compare with normal release but those statistic will of course be publish in the usual way in due course on hotel make provision to allow the emergency use of hotel accommodation for prisoner release under the scheme to prevent any homelessness that might lead to high rate of recall few than prisoner have be house in hotel and at very low cost this be temporary measure and do not anticipate that it will be use any more extensively than it have be already on foreign national offender will return to this house on that matter but work be under way across government and be work closely with my colleague in the home office will be publish for the house and will return to the house with the detail of the further measure on the home detention curfew the shadow lord chancellor rightly say that not everybody be automatically eligible for home detention curfew there be still risk assessment and safeguard concern be the no way in which domestic abuse issue show up as red flag for particular prisoner would not imagine that those previous and current arrangement will change very much with the measure we will take thank the shadow lord chancellor for the contract conclude with serco to deliver the tagging it may not have be he directly and personally but it be his government the performance of serco have be unacceptable let be very clear with the house there be no shortage of tag in this country it have fail to make sure that it have enough staff in place to tag everybody who need tag its progress have be monitor daily by my ministers and official in the department and we will continue to hold its foot to the fire we will levy financial penalty and all option remain on the table performance have improve little it have make progress but all option be on the table if that fall back in any way the shadow lord chancellor will know that be not go to comment on anything relate to the budget the chancellor will make her statement in due course gently remind he that the budget of the ministry of justice under the tory party leave lot to be desire call the chair of the justice committee welcome the approach the lord chancellor be take to the management of the prison system and the appointment of david gauke to head the sentencing review give that the initiative she have announce today to relieve pressure on prison will create additional work for already overstretch probation officer will she make further statement when she have decide what operational change she be go to make to the probation service the additional prison place she have promise to build will take prison capacity to above be that desirable in the long term give her intention to expand punishment outside prison will she make it her aim in time to close some of the bad of our exist prison build two or three century ago which warehouse crime and despite the good effort of prison staff do little or nothing to reform or rehabilitate their inmate thank the chair of the select committee for his question on probation recognise the very high workload that probation officer be work under we commit in our manifesto to strategic review of probation governance have make sure that we have bring forward the recruitment of an extra probation officer by march next year we be work closely with probation union and probation staff on the frontline to manage the situation be very conscious that we do not want to take the pressure out of the prison and just leave it with the probation service instead this be whole system response and the whole system need to be stabilise and able to face the pressure we see in it on the prison population make no mistake the number of prison place will increase in this country we will deliver the the previous government do not deliver and the prison population will therefore rise however as have say we can not build our way out of this crisis and we do have to do thing differently we be very long way away from any of the change the chair of the select committee may want to see but fundamentally we must make sure and the review must make sure that we never ever run out of prison place in this country again call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement have myself grow up in home of domestic violence at the hand of my mum former partner share the concern of the victims commissioner and survivor of domestic abuse that loophole in the early release scheme criterion could mean that some of their abuser who have be convict of violent offence but not of domestic violence specific offence may have be release early today know the secretary of state attempt to provide some reassurance but can say to she that have receive communication from affected people outside this chamber who be not satisfied with those assurance yet domestic abuse survivor deserve to be safe can she address these concern today we welcome the government determination to fix the mess that the conservatives make of our criminal justice system through the evidence lead independent sentencing review the former lord chancellor chair it and have track record of fix thing together in my past life use to run social enterprise phone repair company staff by ex offender and we run pop up repair shop in the moj at one of which the then lord chancellor david gauke eagerly present his phone for repair hope this lord chancellor share that collaborative fix spirit when it come to engage with the liberal democrats and on this review and will happily sort the secretary of state out with phone repair if she need one while empirical evidence will be critical to this review some of the most valuable insight on this matter be hold by victim and survivor themselves be therefore disappointed not to find the word victim or survivor mention once anywhere in the term of reference although have hear the secretary of state say they today will she put that right and outline specifically how victim and survivor will be represent and formally consult in the sentencing review finally even though the secretary of state have say there will be no constraint and no constriction something else miss from the review be the injustice of indeterminate imprisonment for public protection sentence under which almost people remain imprison with no release date what be more people be serve ipp sentence who have commit less offence than those be release today under the government early release scheme reform these sentence could help address prison overcrowding and the safety crisis so why have the government explicitly exclude ipp sentence from this review and will she reconsider that decision thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for his question be sorry to hear about his personal experience but they will of course inform the valuable contribution that he make in this house from his own live experience as the hon gentleman know there be not specific offence of domestic abuse in our legislative framework to bring in the emergency release scheme to prevent we from run out of prison space in july have pull every lever at my disposal we can make these change in law only by exclude offence not offender cohort or offender type that be why the list of offence cover include those most closely connected to domestic abuse situation but it be not of course fully comprehensive it can not be because we can exclude only offence not offender type hope he will recognise that pull these lever as early as possible in the parliament almost as soon as walk into the department because want to give the probation service time to prepare for this change specifically it be so that it could notify victim work on proper release plan for these offender make sure that the licence condition be the right one and make sure that the monitoring of these offender in the community be as strong as it need to be the hon gentleman will also know that those who be flag as have domestic violence background be prioritise for tag every choice have make in bring forward these emergency release change have be make to try to minimise the impact on victim really empathise with and be very affect by the concern of victim that those who have offend against they be be release some week or month early that might sound small but know it have huge impact and do not seek to minimise that in any way as say have pull every lever at my disposal to try to minimise those concern on the sentencing review when we reveal the whole panel we will ensure that victim voice be represent as that be important in the term of reference we have try to capture the fact that all of society suffer collectively when we do not get reoffende rate down this be strategy for cut crime and produce few victim in future which hope the hon gentleman will support ipp sentence be specifically exclude that be challenging cohort of prisoner in our system and where it be safe to do so be determined to make progress on release those who be currently serve an ipp sentence work with the previous government and support change to the licence term and condition bring in by the conservative administration we be implement change that be make in the victims and prisoners act which be enact just before the general election what we can not do be release people who still pose risk to the public and with this cohort of offender can not release those who be still danger to themselves and to other get that balance right be incredibly important and hope the hon gentleman will acknowledge that it be not appropriate to put that cohort of offender within the sentencing review under the conservative government more than one in two people who serve short term custodial sentence go on to reoffend in total reoffende be cost our country billion year that be not work at all and not work for the taxpayer in my constituency and across hertfordshire fantastic charity such as the hertfordshire association for the care and rehabilitation of offenders be run innovative and pioneer programme and work with ex offender to ensure that they do not offend again will my right hon friend say little more about how the government will adopt new approach and work with charity and broad civil society to cut reoffende for good my hon friend be right reoffende have huge cost for we all as country because it create more victim of crime indeed it cost we more than billion at about billion year charity and other group have huge role to play in help to bring down the reoffende rate but to allow that work to succeed we must bring down overcrowding and the capacity crisis in our prison hope the sentencing review will help we to chart new course when it come to bring down reoffende thank the lord chancellor for her statement in the first wave of early release prisoner be wrongly release what step be she take to ensure that those mistake be not repeat do she agree that the good way to reduce reoffending be to ensure that release prisoner be able to participate in the labour market and what will she do to improve education and training within the prison system on the who be wrongly release have never imagine that it would be possible for people to be charge and sentence under an old act of parliament and not the more recent sentencing act and as soon as that issue be bring to our attention we take immediate step all be ultimately return to custody and will ensure that that mistake can not happen again the hon gentleman make good point about reduce reoffende access to literacy training and skill and the ability to get job be important in help an offender turn their back on life of crime and hope the sentencing review will make further positive suggestion on that we know we have to tackle reoffende and we know that job housing and so on be part of the picture if we be to persuade people to become the well citizen that we need they to be rather than the well criminal that our system currently produce welcome the secretary of state review of sentencing but as she may know people who be neurodivergent be hugely over represent in the prison population what step will she take to ensure that prisoner with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism do not reoffend my hon friend be right to say that the support prisoner receive in prison must be tailor to take account of need such as neurodivergence and autism much of which have go undiagnosed in the life of prisoner and often do not even get diagnose within the prison estate we must obviously turn that around and be confident we can make progress in that area first we have to deal with the capacity crisis because when prison be very overcrowded offender be lock up for hour day and in that one remain hour little good work can be do we must deal with the capacity problem so that we can then deal with the underlie issue that prisoner face before they can make the positive choice that we all want the secretary of state have identify good set of principle for her review on the texan approach do she think that it would be fair to victim if rather than we look at extend early release far we use the reward of the exist access to early release she talk lot about evidence but she will understand that it be hard to evidence victim feeling about justice and that risk great weight be give to statistic on reoffende and other information that the ministry of justice have to hand how do she propose to close the gap in evidence relate to how victim and their family feel about sentencing the hon gentleman make good point the texan model be of interest because it seek to incentivise the positive behaviour that reduce reoffende and ultimately cut crime and texas see some pretty spectacular result there be no exact read across from that model to our system and it will be for the review to consider that model and other around the world to see what approach might work here it be imperative that any measure we take retain the confidence of victim and the wide public any punishment that take place outside prison need to still look and feel like proper punishment to every community in our country that be non negotiable public confidence must be maintain and that speak to the hon gentleman second point evidence be important and in my experience when victim be engage in the process they appreciate the need to reduce reoffende because they do not want other people to be victim their voice will be hear in the review hope that reassure he in june david gauke make speech as lord chancellor on smart sentencing it be helpful coherent cogent evidence base speech about sentencing reform four conservative prime ministers later no progress have be make so be pleased that the labour government will grasp the nettle we be just discuss the texan example of problem solve and sentencing but can the lord chancellor reassure that the review will also consider family drug and alcohol court and the progress and positive result that we have see in the family court my hon friend make the case well for why david gauke be the right person to lead this review as say he bring deep expertise to this debate be sure that the sentencing review panel will be interested as many be in some of the pilot that be be run on problem solve court and also in the family court what measure be the lord chancellor take to ensure that the review consider the impact of sentence police on different socioeconomic group and address concern about disproportionate sentence for marginalised community and minority group the hon member raise an important point that issue be not within the review term of reference it will not consider disparity in sentencing because it be look at the overall sentencing framework and how we ensure that we never run out of prison place again there be an important debate on disparity in the criminal justice system the review on sentencing be not the proper place for that but we will take forward that other work in due course declare an interest be the honorary life president of the prison officers association thank the secretary of state on behalf of the poa for her open door policy on engagement with the union congratulate she on bring forward the sentencing review the poa have long argue that there be too many people in prison in particular with mental health problem they include veteran with post traumatic stress disorder who should not be there but should be treat elsewhere will she ensure that the union be fully involve in decide on the composition of the panel and the engagement process for the review work closely with our trade union be important to we we have already engage with the prison officers association let place on record my thank to all who work in our prison and our probation system in our prison in particular the rate of violence against prison officer have be too high for too long salute the hard work that prison officer do in difficult job on behalf of we all my right hon friend can be assure of our close engagement with everybody who work in his majesty prison and probation service go forward parliament legislate for maximum sentence of life imprisonment for cause death by dangerous driving but judge be yet to impose such sentence despite such case as the one in my constituency in which three people be kill by driver in case with five aggravate factor will the lord chancellor ensure that when the review consider long custodial sentence it look at how victim can get justice and how the maximum sentence legislate for by this place be apply the hon member will know that sentencing decision in individual case be matter for the independent judiciary who have to consider all the fact in front of they and sentence accordingly base on the law the sentencing guideline and the framework can not comment on the specific of the case he mention the review will not be constrain in any way in its inquiry or on maximum sentence whole life order and so on the whole range of sentence that be available be open for the review panel to consider and make recommendation on thank my right hon friend for her handling of the issue and the approach she be take in response to the challenge she face this morning meet local police leadership to discuss the challenge around drug base criminality in leyton and wanstead the situation they face could not be clear after year of tory failure overstretched police service over capacity prison and woefully underfunde probation service and council have lead to vicious cycle of reoffende do she agree that the whole system need reform and investment to restore public trust in our justice system and to keep my constituent safe my hon friend will know that in our safe street mission improve confidence in the criminal justice system be one of the key outcome we be focus on he be right to make the point that the whole criminal justice system require stabilisation it all need to be put on well trajectory than the one we inherit from the previous government we be talk in detail about prison but it be difficult to divorce what be happen in our prison system from what be go on in probation and the court reassure he that conceive of this as whole system approach be aware of the challenge in other bit of the system they be thing that this government will ultimately sort out the lord chancellor speak with great clarity and determination on this issue and be sure that she will remember last week promise ministerial meeting involve my constituent andrew duncan and specialist team they be work on new concept of community detention that believe be tailor make for the vision that the lord chancellor have outline to we today can she confirm that the meeting will go ahead notwithstanding the extra opportunity to give evidence to the gauke review in due course know immediately that the right hon gentleman be go to ask about the meeting he reference last week when make my other statement assure he that will follow that up be interested in the work of the group that he mention and be sure that the sentencing review panel will also be interested in it thank the lord chancellor for her statement and for the leadership she have show in try to turn around department that by any metric be fail thank she for the transparent and consider approach that she have take in reach some of the difficult decision she have have to make since take office while accept the inevitability of the early release scheme what conversation have she have with ministerial colleague on improve victim support for those who have see perpetrator return to the community early than they be perhaps mentally prepared for so as to reduce harm as far as possible can assure my hon friend that my ministerial team and have be work closely with our colleague primarily in the home office but also across government support for victim sit in different department but we be make sure that we have one team approach to this important matter have seek to pull the lever at my disposal in such way that we give the probation service the time it need to prepare for the change do that because want to ensure that our obligation under the victim notification scheme could be meet be monitor progress on that regularly and will ensure that any improvement require be make on continual basis we keep this under constant review neil foden be in prison for the sexual abuse of four vulnerable schoolchildren he be the headteacher and strategic headteacher at two secondary school in gwynedd foden be convict of charge and sentence to year in july this year for his abhorrent crime the judge say he show no remorse can the lord chancellor advise how to seek assurance for his victim that foden will not be release until he have serve at least two third of his sentence can confirm that all sex offence of all type be exclude from the measure very much welcome the lord chancellor sentencing review but on immediate systemic issue privately run forest bank prison in salford be at capacity with continue report over the year of high level of violence and insufficient rehabilitative training for prisoner the contract run out in january can the secretary of state confirm who will be run the prison after that date will she be bring it back under state control what measure be she take to urgently ensure safety in the prison and adequate rehabilitative training will not pre empt any future decision on any particular prison but be not ideological about whether prison be run by the state or privately there be good prison of both type in the sector there be some fail state run prison and some fail privately run prison the most important thing be that we get on top of the capacity crisis across the whole prison estate we have to reduce overcrowding so that we can focus on the good quality rehabilitation activity that know governor in every type of prison want to ensure so that prisoner can be help to turn their life around congratulate the lord chancellor on recognise that for some prisoner the shortcoming of short sentence be properly remedie by provide for long one on the review and david gauke it be difficult not to like he and even admire he but be not alone in regard he as notorious wet be will leave those characterisation to the internal working of the conservative party consider david gauke to be person with deep expertise in this area he be former lord chancellor who know this territory very well he will be able to hit the ground run and know that he will go where the evidence take he the lord chancellor refer to successful work in texas if we adopt such model over here how will victim be involve in shape that tough rehabilitation approach we will make sure that the review panel when it be fully put together include somebody with experience of work with victim of crime to make sure that that perspective be fully reflect in the investigation that the review undertake and ultimately in its finding and recommendation may congratulate the lord chancellor on the term of reference of this review and the appointment of the excellent david gauke remain concerned however about the government evident enthusiasm for increase capacity may ask the lord chancellor directly whether she agree with her colleague in the other place that we imprison too many people in this country be the lord chancellor ultimate aim to reduce the prison population we need to make sure that we have the prison place we need to lock up those who have to be lock up that be fundamentally non negotiable we have to see an increase in prison capacity mention early that the previous government fail to deliver place without they we will run out of prison place again we have to build the supply and we have to do well on reoffende all these thing be equally important and they all have to be do at the same time will not set arbitrary figure for how many people can and should go to prison want to ensure that we never again run out of prison place that we do well on rehabilitation and that we expand punishment outside prison welcome the announcement of the bipartisan sentencing review panel and thank my right hon friend for her continue work to fix the mess of the last year in this department the evidence show that of adult on short sentence go on to reoffend while community order have reoffending rate can she assure that the panel will consider that as part of its remit that be exactly the sort of area that the panel will review although the reoffende rate for community order be low they be still far too high be sure that the sentencing panel will want to consider how to bring all the number down so that we can ensure we be rehabilitate more people and ultimately cut crime in the justice committee highlight the fact that too many offender be imprison because community order with mental health requirement be unavailable in many area across the country do the lord chancellor agree that we must now work across the health and justice system to ensure that adequate provision be available in this essential area my hon friend be absolutely right can assure she that will work closely with the secretary of state for health and social care to make sure that there be join up across government and that we do everything we can to reduce reoffende rehabilitate more people and ultimately cut crime welcome the secretary of state statement particularly her preference for the deportation of foreign criminal and her comment that for hyper prolific offender particular problem in my constituency long sentence may be good whatever the outcome of the review can she commit that dangerous criminal who pose threat to the public in hartlepool or anywhere else will always be lock up under this government yes absolutely can the whole point of the review be to ensure that the country be never again in position in which we might run out of prison place and to ensure that those who must be lock up to keep the public safe will always be lock up keep prisoner in prison cost the taxpayer over year whereas punish the prisoner out of prison cost less than year what be more the prisoner be then far less likely to reoffend do the secretary of state agree that taxpayer money would be well spend on have much cheap and well alternative to prison my hon friend make really important point about the relative cost of imprisonment and of punishment out of prison deliver the prison place that the previous government fail to deliver be big cost but it will be meet by this government we must also ensure that we expand punishment out of prison all option must be pursue if we be to get to grip with this crisis be not give to hyperbole will simply say that my right hon friend have inherit shocking and dangerous situation and be deal with it in calm and collect manner applaud and support the move to more sensible and sustainable policy on sentencing but will she assure my constituent in rugby that we will always lock up violent and dangerous offender where necessary to keep the public safe let assure my hon friend that the answer to his question be yes and yes part of the reason for do the review be to ensure that this country be never again on the brink of run out of prison place and that dangerous offender who need to be lock up to keep the public safe will always be lock up welcome the sentencing review and thank the secretary of state for her explanation of why ipp sentence be not include in the review what step will she take to accelerate route out of custody for prisoner serve ipp sentence include re sentencing review that can be do without prejudice to public protection to end an injustice once and for all and to increase capacity on our prison estate hear the point my hon friend make and she make it very well we be not consider re sentencing exercise for ipp prisoner because that would automatically release number of people who we do not believe it would be safe to release be not willing to compromise public protection know that there be huge injustice at the heart of these issue and that ipp sentence have rightly be abolish but we have problem with the cohort in particular those under an ipp sentence who have never be release at all be determined to make more progress wherever it be possible to do so safely on release more ipp prisoner but never in way that compromise public protection welcome the secretary of state commitment to cross party working transparency and rebuild public trust do she agree that this be significant departure from the previous government who release over prisoner not in the open but in secret agree my hon friend be right to remind the house of the last conservative government end of custody supervise licence scheme for which we in the end have to release the number over offender be release under that scheme without transparency and without the same exemption that we have apply to the change what mess we have inherit thank the lord chancellor for the step that she have take today to sort it out we know that offender who be subject to home detention order be less likely to reoffend but can we put they to work as well during unpaid work session can we ensure that offender who commit further offence while on licence be deal with more robustly in the court as they be recall to prison my hon friend raise really important point about how we break the cycle of recall to prison and ensure that licence condition be abide by and about the scope for put more offender to work be sure that these will be matter of great interest to the sentencing review panel look forward to see its finding in due course the past year have show that government ignore the prison estate at their peril my right hon friend rightly say that we must redesign punishment outside the secure estate will she elaborate on how offender will have their liberty curtail and how the public will be make aware of that liberty be take away the modern world with different technology present the good possible opportunity for we to expand the use of punishment out of prison but in way that give the public confidence that offender be be supervise that the eye of the state remain on they and that their behaviour and their liberty be effectively curtail expect that new technology as well as current available technology will be of great interest to the review panel look forward to its finding when it report in the spring bill present trade agreements exclusion of national

committee of the red cross status bill lords second reading beg to move that the bill be now read second time put on the record my previous engagement with the commonwealth parliamentary association on many excellent and informative trip that contribute to our relationship across the commonwealth and my past engagement with the international committee of the red cross be delighted to see the bill back in the house hope that there will be wholehearte unity today to ensure that it make it to royal assent think this be its fourth iteration the last time it be debate here be as private member bill in the last session but sadly it run out of time before the dissolution of parliament for the general election pay tribute to the former member for basingstoke for her tireless work in introduce that bill and push it through and to many hon member some of whom see here today for their past work with the cpa and the icrc it be critical that both the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross be give their correct status in uk legislation to conduct their work and deliver their objective while operate in the uk this will help to guarantee that the cpa remain headquarter in the uk and will ensure that the uk can guarantee the icrc that the confidential information that it share as matter of course with the uk government be secure and protect the uk be deeply committed to the commonwealth and believe that the commonwealth heads of government meeting which the foreign secretary be attend in samoa will be an important opportunity to mobilise action on share interest include uphold share commonwealth value those value be embody by the cpa important work to strengthen inclusive and accountable democracy across the commonwealth think back to my own many engagement with the cpa in which have see that work at first hand both when delegation have visit and when have be part of delegation the uk value its partnership with the cpa and be proud to support the work of the cpa and its regional branch cpa uk that include develop benchmark and indicator of parliamentary democracy and address modern slavery in supply chain and issue such as gender base violence with parliaments and parliamentarian across the commonwealth the icrc be an essential partner in achieve the uk global humanitarian objective it have unique mandate from state to uphold the geneva convention and work globally to promote international humanitarian law its impartiality neutrality and independence allow it to engage and negotiate with all party to conflict and to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable population often in contexts in which other agency be unable to operate have witness its important work in opposition and in my past career in the humanitarian sector clause and will therefore provide for both organisation to be treat in manner comparable to an international organisation with the associate privilege and immunity treatment as an international organisation will allow the cpa to continue to operate fully across the commonwealth and international fora it will allow the organisation to participate fully in area in which it be currently restrict include sign up to joint international statement and communiqué that be vital to ensure that the cpa can continue its work to promote democracy and good governance across the commonwealth the cpa be currently register with the charity commission for england and wales and be not an international intergovernmental organisation it therefore have its own unique constitutional arrangement that reflect its specific international mandate clause be critical to enable the icrc to operate in the uk in accordance with its international mandate maintain its strict adherence to the principle of neutrality impartiality and independence and its work method of confidentiality the icrc be not an inter governmental organisation either it have its own unique and historical international humanitarian mandate to protect the life and dignity of victim of armed conflict and other situation of violence and to provide they with assistance nobody doubt the good work of the cpa or the icrc we have all see it as parliamentarian but do the minister understand that many of we be little wary about confer privilege and immunity by order in council after the bill be pass since this house be not in general in the habit of grant privilege and immunity without scrutiny the right hon gentleman can be assure that these be the appropriate measure we have determine this way in line with previous discussion on the previous iteration of the bill this be the good way to achieve the aim of the bill in timely fashion so that the provision be put in place for the cpa and the icrc be very happy to write to he far on this matter the bill will face scrutiny in committee where we will be able to discuss these matter in great detail the provision in clause and will ensure that the cpa and the icrc can be accord comparable treatment to an international organisation even when the definition of international organisation in exist legislation be limit to intergovernmental organisation for the cpa this treatment will be limit to its core international organ such as the secretariat it be not intend that any privilege immunity or other facility be extend to any of the national or sub national branch so this be limited provision the arrangement for both organisation will detail the day to day management of the privilege and immunity grant on functional need basis and other facility they will make it clear that there will be no immunity for the cpa secretary general or representative of the icrc in respect of damage cause by for example motor vehicle operate or own by either the way that the limitation and requirement have be set out in this regard be important clause lay out an important confidentiality provision to protect certain information provide in confidence to his majesty government by the icrc from be disclose in uk civil court proceeding or under any statutory provision or rule of law as my noble friend baroness chapman state on second reading in the other place this provision reflect the icrc standard working method of confidentiality which be design to protect its staff and operation in active conflict zone be sure that member will understand that publicly disclose information that the icrc obtain from confidential dialogue with conflict party be likely to put at risk its ability to have confidential dialogue with conflict party its humanitarian access and indeed the security of its staff and might result in the icrc restrict the information it share with the uk however in relation to the concern that member have raise in the past the bill do not provide an absolute blanket exemption for disclosure requirement for all icrc communication important limitation have be incorporate such as the exclusion of criminal case the government continue to be commit to respect the confidentiality of icrc information as matter of policy past practice have demonstrate the importance of do so the bill be an opportunity to end any uncertainty about the government position and to put this practice on statutory footing want to turn briefly to clause which be equivalent to section of the international organisations act which allow the secretary of state to certify question of fact relate to the status of or the privilege and immunity confer on the organisation in the context of court proceeding if question arise of whether person be entitle to any privilege or immunity by virtue of an order in council make under clause or such certification be to be treat as conclusive evidence of those fact for the purpose of proceeding clause detail the scope and extent of the orders in council that confer privilege and immunity on both organisation under clause and respectively this relate to the intervention from the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison an order in council may make different provision for different case or person and it may also contain consequential supplementary incidental transitional or save provision clause also provide the enable power for two important aspect first the order in council may specify circumstance in which privilege and immunity do not apply either because of an exception or because they have be waive by the organisation and secondly the order in council may specify that fiscal relief and exemption be subject to arrangement or condition impose by the secretary of state clause provide that any order in council make for these purpose will be subject to the draft affirmative parliamentary procedure which mean that they will require the approval of both houses before they may have effect the list of privilege and immunity that may be confer on both organisation be set out in the schedule to the bill and have be inform by the international organisations act briefly clause explain that the term icrc mean the international committee of the red cross as give under clause and it ensure that the definition of statutory provision allow for the treatment of the cpa and the icrc as international organisation in respect of all relevant primary and secondary legislation include devolve legislation in scotland wales and northern ireland whenever make in conclusion and to reiterate what be say in the other place the bill will give the cpa and the icrc the correct status in uk legislation to allow both organisation to continue their international operation without unnecessary restriction the government have strong commitment to the commonwealth it continue to support our global humanitarian objective through our work with the icrc and the bill be true reflection of that hope that it will enjoy the wholehearte support of the house as it proceed swiftly into law commend it to the house first pay tribute to my right hon friend the former member for basingstoke maria miller who champion the bill so vigorously and bring bill on this issue to the house no few than three time thank the minister of state for his kind word about she before parliament be dissolve the bill have complete its passage through the house of commons and its second reading in the house of lords although the number of hon friend behind may suggest otherwise we on the conservative benches will support the bill an update of it have be bring before parliament also thank my noble friend baroness anelay of st johns who have long campaign for the bill provision in the other place and lord ahmad the previous minister for the commonwealth who fully understand the need for and importance of the bill pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for melton and syston edward argar who wrap up this debate when we be last in government fear that shall not do it the justice that he do as his constituency neighbour shall do my good the bill may be small and technical but it be important the legal change it contain will ensure the continued success of the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross two organisation that do vital work in the uk as you be aware madam deputy speaker mr speaker be president of the uk commonwealth parliamentary association whose work be indispensable in help to realise the commonwealth charter commitment to the development of free and democratic society as the minister say it be timely that we should be debate the bill today as the commonwealth heads of government meet in samoa it be the first ever commonwealth heads of government meeting to be hold in pacific small state island that demonstrate the importance of the commonwealth in empower the voice of small state and the equity of membership of all of those in the commonwealth have be privileged to both attend and speak at cpa summit under mr speaker presidency and have learn huge amount from commonwealth colleague although perhaps surprisingly for those in the house do not have any foreign visit with they to declare the cpa create pathway to friendship across the commonwealth build up the person to person relationship that matter so very much we be all very aware of the acute threat to democracy internationally the cpa be genuinely positive institution allow good practice to be share link parliamentarian in friendship and strengthen resilience across our society long may it continue very much welcome the bill which support two important organisation the king be currently in australia as the head of the commonwealth will my hon friend join in pay tribute to the commonwealth that family of nation with share value and to the commonwealth parliamentary association which as she have say provide such an opportunity to share good practice and spread the common good of democracy right across the commonwealth thank my hon friend it be so rare for we to celebrate the positive in this house but the bill do exactly that we should be proud of how his majesty have champion the commonwealth both before he become our monarch and since look forward to his arrival in samoa in the come day the conservative government proudly run multiple project with the commonwealth parliamentary association to strengthen the democratic nature of legislature and how decision be approach and make ultimately the bill will amend the legal environment to ensure that the cpa remain headquarter in the uk again we can all agree that that be unambiguously positive in an increasingly dark world it be worth fight for those small shoot of light that offer glimpse of path to well future this be one will turn to the international committee of the red cross the icrc have unique legitimacy to engage all party to conflict and unparalleled access to vulnerable people in conflict zone frequently it be the only agency operate at scale in conflict for example it be currently operate in ukraine afghanistan and syria declare an interest as have previously work with the organisation in some of those zone in alone the icrc staff support over hospital mainly in conflict zone and provide food assistance to more than million people be proud that the previous conservative government commit million to the icrc to provide life save care and essential supply to people affect by the conflict in nagorno karabakh the bill will guarantee to the icrc that the sensitive information that it must be able to share with the government will be protect we do not want the icrc to have to restrict the information that it share with the uk because of the risk of disclosure so the bill make an important step particularly when it come to hostage give that there be so much suffering globally we need to take every possible step to ensure that our humanitarian effort be effective be pleased that there will be hope cross party agreement on that the bill will mean that the uk extend the privilege and immunity to both organisation in manner comparable to that of an international organisation of which we be member the measure may be little novel but it be neat legal solution that address both central challenge around which the bill be centre although the change provide firm footing for the future work of both the cpa and the icrc they also offer the opportunity for the fulfilment of foreign policy objective if they be to be success the government must seize the opportunity present by the bill once our relationship with the icrc be secure how do the government plan on improve collaboration and most importantly result what share area of interest will the government focus on and how will those manifest in tangible outcome have the minister assess which specific part of the bill will facilitate that work if so will he share that assessment with the house on the cpa have the minister scope any additional support that the government could provide to both the delegation and the institution as whole to bolster its work will he commit to building on the good work of the conservative government to help strengthen institution in commonwealth country use whole ecosystem approach finally when we be in government we commit that the foreign secretary would consult the chair of the uk branch and the secretary general of the cpa and the president and director general of the icrc respectively before finalise secondary legislation can the minister confirm that that have take place if democracy be to thrive there need to be equilibrium across range of area from justice and the application of the rule of law to the protection of human right freedom of speech safeguard against corruption effective effort to counter extremism integrity in the public sector and the capability to face down external threat and protect our people at time when the world be more insecure and more dangerous we be face by authoritarian state bend on undermine the open international order on which so much of our security and prosperity rest the commonwealth be more important than ever and we must not allow any insinuation otherwise to undermine our effort on its behalf the organisation account for more than quarter of the membership of the united nations and more need to be do with it crucially through the commonwealth charter it be champion of the sound value and principle that must prevail in the future if we be to build well world the government must not forgo the opportunity to deepen that co operation with commonwealth partner and enhance the benefit of membership membership of the commonwealth can and must be see as route to well future fundamentally rooted in the noble value set out in the commonwealth charter we must strengthen intra commonwealth

time money and commitment into our commonwealth family we need each other right now more than ever let now turn to the international committee of the red cross and indeed the international red cross and red crescent movement as whole every day they provide hope for hundred of thousand of people across the globe who be face disaster of many kind want to thank the icrc personally for its consistent and valuable engagement with my committee for those reason fully support the bill the network consist of million people most of whom be volunteer they help other face disaster conflict health issue and social challenge and pay tribute to they the movement consist of the icrc national red cross and red crescent society and the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies the icrc itself have more than staff in over country and its work have gain it three nobel peace prize at time when more than million people be flee armed conflict globally the work of this organisation be vital and can not be underestimate the icrc be also crucial to parliamentary engagement with these situation and be sure that member on both side of the house have benefit from its wisdom its ability to provide the international development committee with up to date impartial trustworthy and relevant briefing from the ground and it do that in private when necessary have allow successive idc to raise the profile of disaster and importantly to hold government to account for their response in february this year its team in egypt meet our committee to discuss the humanitarian situation in gaza the egyptian team be co ordinate all the supply into gaza at that point and their work be phenomenal here be group of volunteer who uproot themselves to go where other need their support the

crescent society worker have be kill in gaza and the west bank six member of the magen david adom the red cross in israel have also be kill while help other since october yet their colleague continue the lifesave medical care food distribution water and sanitation project support those who have be detain and remind party of their obligation under international humanitarian law in diabolical war

virtually as this be during the pandemic we discuss the impact of covid on conflict affect community the situation in yemen syria and myanmar and the need for the idc to continue to shine light on conflict affect context around the world that be commitment that we continue to honour in november last year the committee meet the icrc director for the africa region to discuss sudan in the last parliament the icrc submit evidence for the inquiry into climate change aid effectiveness racism in the aid sector and prevent sexual exploitation and abuse its submission be hugely helpful as the committee make its recommendation to the government and again and again they have prove to be an invaluable resource for parliament on the application of international humanitarian law this much need bill will allow the icrc to continue to operate in the uk with its international mandate and will provide the security need for it to continue its vital impartial work with immunity from jurisdiction hope that the house give it safe passage call the liberal democrat spokesperson be pleased to welcome the bill and support the recognition of the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross as international organisation as liberal we be internationalist and the bill fit with liberal democrat policy of international co operation and the upholding of international humanitarian law by support the strengthening of international body and organisation that seek to forward those aim anything that can be do in this fragile global environment to strengthen global collaboration be something that we must support treat these organisation as international body would be testament to the house share commitment to international humanitarian law which we want to be practise even in the most fraught zone of conflict and our commitment to good governance and its promotion in the world the international committee of the red cross be an independent body that play crucial role in protect civilian life in the midst of conflict and war zone today when there be more than ongoing armed conflict in the world its work be need more than ever it have be active over the last year in ukraine help to ensure that over million people have have access to water heat and electricity it have work in sudan distribute food assistance to more than people and help with water purification benefit more than million people in gaza it have be support basic need and medical equipment it have engage the party of the conflict and remind they of their responsibility under international humanitarian law and have work to facilitate the release transfer and return of hostage and detainee from both side it be important that we strengthen its ability to do this work without fear the new designation merely mean that we be catch up with many of our peer nation more than state have now grant the icrc relevant privilege and immunity include every other member of the un security council in recognition of its unique mandate which demand above all that it be allow to maintain its neutrality the icrc history be singularly bind up with the history of the geneva convention it persuade government to adopt the first and original geneva convention year ago this year that treaty oblige army to care for wounded soldier whatever side they be on and introduce the red cross on the white background the unifying emblem for medical service for any and every side across border and enemy line the committee remit expand alongside the successive geneva convention and in expand to include civilian be sure member will acknowledge give current conflict that the icrc obligation to civilian be as essential now as it be year ago indeed in the un estimate that of casualty result from hostility be civilian in such zone the icrc be often almost alone among agency in co ordinating and deliver aid at scale and crucially in have line of communication with belligerent for these reason the fcdo refer to the icrc as an essential partner for achieve the uk humanitarian goal as well as our wish to see international humanitarian law uphold liberal democrats believe in the universal conception of civilian right assert by the fourth geneva convention and the additional protocol in work across conflict zone with non combatant with prisoner hostage and the wound the icrc act as guardian of international humanitarian law that status be possible only because the committee be understand to be neutral apply universal rather than partisan principle the privilege and immunity lay out in the bill include inviolability for its archive and premise which will assure party to conflict of the confidentiality of its information and its independence they also include the testimonial and narrow criminal immunity that will permit the icrc staff to maintain the necessary conversation with proscribe group without which their most challenging work would not be possible neglect to take these step risk threaten the fundamental mission of the icrc at time when it be need more than ever as part of its mandate the committee be in the vanguard of clarify and develop international humanitarian law sadly there have be an increase in permissive interpretation of ihl and without the icrc perspective and experience the analysis through which we protect those catch in conflict zone would be poor the bill also provide for international organisation status to be confer on the commonwealth parliamentary association which be make up of commonwealth legislature from commonwealth country as other member have point out this seem particularly fitting moment for the bill to reach the house give that leader be now gather in samoa for the commonwealth heads of government meeting the commonwealth be rare organisation be voluntary association of states bind not by economic or security tie but by share value and even more by share aspiration as the instrument through which aspiration and value be pursue the constitution of the cpa uphold share principle of democracy development equality human right and environmental protection the cpa have promote and strengthen parliamentary democracy since its establishment in and it allow for parliamentarian from across the commonwealth to engage in dialogue and learn from each other we support enhance the status of the cpa by grant it protection and immunity that be comparable to those of the commonwealth foundation and the commonwealth of learning in the cpa publish its indicator against which parliamentary democracy can be measure these be update in to include the un sustainable development goal which chime with the liberal democrats manifesto commitment to put the sdg at the heart of our international development policy although we be disappoint that the labour party manifesto do not mention the sdg we have be encourage by the fact that they be reference in the chatham house speech give by the minister for development last week hope that member of all party be unite in our commitment to the sdg the commonwealth include both the world most populous democracy and its least populous since jurisdiction have undertake assessment use the cpa criterion and many have subsequently participate in technical assistance programme multi year programme that be focus on strengthen institution and build parliamentary capacity with its new status as an international inter parliamentary organisation the cpa will be enable to sign the international agreement that it have be prevent from signing hold commonwealth government to account for action against parliamentarian provide member parliaments with well governance and participate fully in commonwealth work include at chogm be glad that the house be consider this bill which be design to support the work of the cpa and the icrc by designate they as international organisation this step will simplify the challenge that they both face in work so widely across the globe as essential vehicle for the delivery of international humanitarian aid and democracy which be never more need than now it will underscore our commitment to the commonwealth keep the cpa headquarter in the uk and ensure that the icrc remain secure in the uk anything that this house can do to ease the execution of their work which have such noble aim should be jump at and the liberal democrats support this bill rise to support the second reading of this bill which be long overdue and as we have hear have cross party support it have receive unwavering support in both this parliamentary session and the previous parliament which be testament to the importance that member on both side of this house place on its intention as we have hear the debate be timely give that the commonwealth heads of government meeting be take place this week to address global security and the environmental and social challenge affect we all the commonwealth nation be unite in their belief in the rule of law and the importance of democracy since its birth in the commonwealth parliamentary association have promote those endure value as the commonwealth parliamentary arm with the threat of global conflict more present than ever the work of the cpa to protect develop and advance parliamentary democracy be more important than ever before it be therefore crucial that the cpa which be currently limit by its status as uk charity can participate fully in the international community be pleased that this bill will address that issue for the follow reason first the bill provide some commonwealth parliamentarian with the credibility and authority that they need to operate on the international stage by grant similar privilege and immunity to those bestow on comparable international organisation the bill place the cpa on an equal standing at international fora so that member have the require platform to address global challenge this also mean that the organisation will enjoy similar legal status to its parliamentary strengthen counterpart such as the inter parliamentary union in switzerland reinforce its reliability as preferred partner for legislature in capacity building my second point relate to the organisation scope welcome the bill because it extend the potential breadth of the cpa work by treat it like the other international organisation of which the uk be member this will allow the cpa to expand its programme project and activity on parliamentary practice and procedure as uk charity the cpa be currently subject to restriction under uk legislation on the charity sector for example it be limit in its ability to sign international convention and pursue political purpose the cpa be therefore restrict in its ability to fully promote the value set out in the commonwealth charter and to address the priority of its membership an example of the cpa priority be find in its recommend benchmark for democratic legislature these be good governance indicator that commonwealth legislator should measure themselves against cover minimum standard on financial oversight engagement with the medium and political petitioning to name but few this bill give the cpa great freedom to promote good governance programme throughout the commonwealth nation furthermore this bill be important for maintain the uk involvement in the cpa and the commonwealth the cpa past two annual conference see its governing body decide to relocate its headquarters to member state that would provide the recognition that it need if this could not be give in the uk the bill do not just empower the organisation it protect the uk global influence by keep the cpa base here so that our parliamentarian can have an active role in promote parliamentary democracy and good governance globally the second organisation on which the bill focus the international committee of the red cross do vital work to protect victim of violence around the world with grow conflict in ukraine gaza sudan and elsewhere the icrc work as an independent humanitarian organisation be crucial this bill seek to protect that independence clause will provide for protect icrc information to be exempt from any legal disclosure requirement impose by court or tribunal order in civil proceeding or by statutory provision or rule of law with exemption for court order in criminal proceeding the bill allow we to give the icrc the guarantee that any information share with the uk government be protect so that it can continue to do crucial work in assess victim of armed conflict the icrc operate under long stand method of confidentiality which mean that it engage mainly in confidential bilateral dialogue with state and other party and it expect state to respect the confidentiality of any information share with they be such information to be make public it would hamper the icrc ability to have confidential dialogue with and to gain the trust of conflict group the icrc need to be perceive as trustworthy organisation when seek dialogue with all actor so that it can have full access to frontline and contested zone indeed this allow the icrc to continue to provide humanitarian assistance in conflict area such as gaza and sudan for example it have deliver metric tonne of medical equipment amid the crisis in gaza and provide food assistance to over people during the conflict in sudan in addition the bill will recognise the icrc as an international organisation its mandate to act in time of global conflict be base on international humanitarian law under the geneva convention of over state include all the permanent member of the un security council have accord the icrc relevant privilege and immunity that be comparable to those of an international organisation the absence of privilege and immunity provide by the uk have result in significant operational challenge for the icrc so it be important that the uk follow its international partner that would allow the icrc to operate in the uk and to manage its resource in manner that be most beneficial to affected person preserve its principle of neutrality this bill be vital step towards ensure that the cpa and the icrc have the full confidence of the uk government to promote our share value of democracy and the rule of law and to provide humanitarian assistance to those who need it have recently be elect to the uk executive committee of the cpa look forward to work with other commonwealth parliamentarian to further those value and promote the standard of good governance that be necessary to make democracy work in today world with the commonwealth heads of government meeting take place in samoa this week it be important that the uk place itself at the heart of global diplomacy and the bill signify our intention to do so this bill be long overdue and in grant privilege and immunity to the cpa and the icrc it far secure their future and show that the uk be back to play an active and important role on the international stage it be great honour to follow the hon member for southgate and wood green bambos charalambous who have attend many inter parliamentary event with and who be an active participant of the cpa the inter parliamentary union the british irish parliamentary assembly and everything else he can be involve in refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests my comment will be short because we have see this bill before and this be probably the third time that have speak in one of these debate definitely the second time on second reading be delighted that it have be bring back and that we will have the chance to get it to royal assent it be vital for the reputation of this place for our view and for the work we do with the cpa uk will restrict my comment to the cpa which be the body with which be most familiar on that note pay tribute to maria miller as my hon friend the member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns do she try many time to pass this bill she be an enormous advocate and true champion for the cpa also pay tribute to ian liddell grainger late of this parish who

parliamentary group please join one they will make friend for life learn about what be go on in the rest of the world and meet people from other legislature not just national legislature the great advantage of the cpa be that it involve parliaments at all level of commonwealth country which mean that there be chance to meet people from devolved parliaments regional parliaments and provincial parliaments when we be in this place we be very focused on what be happen here do not think that many people outside westminster be aware of what we be do but we be really focus on cpa and icrc status and we will be for some time to come this afternoon and beyond beyond that however people be look at other thing in other parliaments last week at the ipu assembly in geneva it be wonderful to meet parliamentarian from around the world and hear what they be do what their focus be and what challenge they face when we do we learn that many of those be common we all face the same challenge but there be some unique thing that other country face that we need to be aware of work on and debate in this place that be where the cpa the british group inter parliamentary union bipa and the british american parliamentary group can bring parliamentarian together and give we that insight be delighted that the bill be before we today and support it wholeheartedly hope that by the time we reach the

third generation immigrant myself whose family live in the city of swansea for more or less exactly year know precisely how he feel in his gratitude to the place in new country that give he every opportunity to develop his talent and ability to the point at which he deservedly find himself in this place be sure he will make maximum use of that opportunity particularly welcome his warm reference to his predecessor mike gapes who serve in this house for no few than year and be the epitome of moderate patriotic labour he win respect on the conservative side of the house as well as on his own side and it be sad that point come when he feel he could no long remain member of the labour party although be glad to see from his wikipedia entry that he be back in the fold today this uncontroversial bill seek to change the status of the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross to convert each of they into what be know as body corporate these be sensible proposal which broadly support however as state during the sir david amess adjournment debate on the rise of the house on september there be one other organisation with which be rather familiar that require the same change in status as the cpa and the icrc to make it into body corporate too that organisation be the office that support the intelligence and security committee of parliament and this bill present we with the timely opportunity to achieve that necessary change indeed it be perfect fit so trust that the house will bear with while explain the serious conflict of interest that have arise why that conflict matter to parliament and how it can easily be rectify with simple addition to the bill before the house today for the benefit of new member in the chamber should explain that the isc be cross party committee of both houses of parliament create by statute in under the justice and security act the isc be give the legal responsibility for oversee the uk intelligence community on behalf of parliament yet parliament intent as express in that act be currently be undermine right hon and hon member might be surprised to learn that the isc office with very small number of staff belong to the cabinet office despite the isc oversee certain sensitive organisation within the cabinet office they would be right to be surprised because that be indeed fundamental conflict of interest which be why when the justice and security act be pass the cabinet office be suppose to be only the temporary home of the isc office yet here we be more than year later with the committee staff still beholden to vulnerable within and unfairly pressured and even victimise by the very part of the executive that the committee be charge with scrutinise and hold to account on behalf of parliament the executive should not be able to constrain and control the committee democratic oversight on parliament behalf by exert control over the isc small staff team to prevent they from do their job independently such control mean that part of the cabinet office can and do starve the team of resource so that the isc staff be unable to fulfil the committee legal responsibility that completely contravene and disregard clear ministerial undertaking give by the then deputy prime minister my right hon friend the member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden before the recent general election about vital extra resource for the isc staff control by the cabinet office also mean that it can stigmatise and penalise the isc staff blame they for the committee robust scrutiny with damaging consequence for their future career in the civil service such deplorable behaviour have include repeatedly downgrade highly positive assessment submit by as isc chairman at the time of staff performance in recent year in reality the member of the isc in the last parliament value the committee staff very highly indeed as believe all member have since the committee be first establish year ago we certainly find the arrangement that have describe totally unacceptable the isc therefore formally resolve by unanimous vote across all three political party on the committee that it be essential for parliamentary democracy and its scrutiny system for the committee office to move out from under the control of the executive that is from the cabinet office and instead to be establish as an independent body corporate with link to parliament rather than to the executive that unanimous decision be confirm by the member of the committee at its meeting on march follow expert and authoritative external advice that it be within the isc power to take such step and to determine the suitable mechanism for implement it that constitutional change which the cabinet office have predictably attempt to ignore be essential to protect the separation of power it be also extremely easy to achieve it require very short amendment to the justice and security act to change the status of the isc office the amendment would establish the office as body corporate to support the intelligence and security committee of parliament and safeguard the independence of the committee itself have hop that the amendment would be include in the new legislative programme unfortunately but unsurprisingly in the committee absence since parliament be dissolve for the general election the cabinet office have hitherto manage to block it however that be to underestimate the previous member of the committee from both side of the house and in both chambers who be convince that the committee office can not and must not continue to be control by the cabinet office the bill in seek to change the constitutional status of the cpa and the icrc and allow well provision for their staffing arrangement be the ideal vehicle through which to achieve the same for the isc beleaguered office it be the obvious place to include short amendment to the justice and security act to change the status of the isc staff organisation too we must not pass up this opportunity parliamentary time be precious and there may not be another suitable vehicle during this parliament as measure to secure democratic oversight be confident that the amendment should and would secure cross party support in both houses prior to the election both the then government and the then opposition seem to accept that this reform be need which do rather beg the question why it have not yet happen intend to return to the issue at later stage of the bill with an amendment and trust for the reason have set out that the house will support it have chair the intelligence and security committee for the past four year and have also serve on it throughout the parliament reiterate what say in after more than four year as chairman of the defence committee it be well to stop while people wish you to carry on than to carry on until people wish you to member hear hear be glad to have that endorsement hopefully can still be friend of both committees on the floor of this chamber while give support to my successor in office it be as extraordinary as it be shameful that no prime minister see fit to meet with the intelligence and security committee during the entirety of the last parliament although to her credit during her short time at no liz truss do offer to do so perhaps the late occupant of downing street will show great respect towards body that have consistently undertake sensitive inquiry and produce report of the high quality and the sound judgment over the past year largely because of the calibre and integrity of its professional director and her dedicated staff let we now do the right thing by they all it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis enjoy his detailed and comprehensive remark be grateful for the opportunity to speak in the debate on this important bill but start by pay tribute to my hon friend the member for ilford south jas athwal for his maiden speech which share his story and the promise of our country declare my interest as co chair of the all party parliamentary group for the commonwealth role be elect to before the summer recess and my newly mint role as member of the executive of the uk branch of the commonwealth parliamentary association the commonwealth be all about create opportunity and never more so than today because have the opportunity to give my first speech without time limit which will enjoy welcome the minister to his place it be the first time have have the opportunity to speak with he on the front bench be look forward to work with he and the foreign office team in the year ahead have know my right hon friend the foreign secretary for most of my life have the benefit of be his constituency twin during the election campaign so he have the great pleasure of be able to visit newcastle under lyme and enjoy our warm hospitality not least at the victoria pub on brampton road the bill have be through the war and be rudely interrupted as we have hear by the general election be very pleased that the government have bring it forward so speedily where we can work together and make cross party progress we should do so as often as we can join the shadow minister the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns in acknowledge the work of the former member for basingstoke dame maria miller also acknowledge all the cpa staff lead by the excellent sarah dickson who believe may be watch the deliberation this afternoon the bill be about our standing on the world stage and our role as leader in the fight for human right respect decency and togetherness as the minister point out it grant international status to both the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross enable both those reputable and long stand body to benefit from the immunity and privilege of all other international body as set out in clause and those immunity and privilege include the power to confer the legal capacity of body corporate on the cpa and the icrc to grant the organisation their information and staff certain privilege and immunity commensurate with their functional need to provide that reference to international organisation in general legislation include from now on reference to the cpa and the icrc and to allow for certain confidential information as ever the united kingdom must lead by example so although the bill may feel technical in nature as the shadow minister say there be wide point here about our leadership at home and abroad that be why it be so important that we keep the cpa headquarter here in the united kingdom the bill have my full support and hope judge by the comment of the liberal democrat spokesperson and the shadow minister it will have support right across the house later this afternoon this may not be the most oversubscribed second reading debate since the general election but that should not be misinterpret as lack of support for lack of faith in or lack of commitment to the commonwealth its legacy and its potential with that in mind and give that the bill will help improve our reputation with our commonwealth partner and friend enormously wish to take moment to talk about the commonwealth and what it mean for today world and for people in newcastle under lyme and right across the global community as we look to the commonwealth heads of government meeting take place in the pacific we can see that this bill be an important and long overdue step be take by the united kingdom in samoa heads of government woman man and young people from across the commonwealth will come together to share idea good practice value and thought for move our global family forward and for make their deliberation mean something in each of our community and nation that be important because our world be in state of real flux we at once seem ever more interconnected and as though we be be drive far and far apart political leader across the world seem more interested in put up barrier and wall than tear they down more interested in what divide we than what unite we and some have no interest in bring people together that be matter of deep concern to but it also show the power and the importance of the commonwealth family of nation the commonwealth be voluntary organisation of independent and equal country perhaps not equal in size of economy or population but equal as their leader sit round the table engage and listen our commonwealth family be make up of about billion people and include both advanced economy and develop country sun and snow global north and global south palm tree and oak kangaroo and cattle and woman man and child who all deserve chance to get on in life to succeed and to feel safe and secure will the hon member give way will happily give way to the member of parliament who represent my in law in south antrim the hon member make the case on international relationship the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley reference the devolved assembly may ask he to acknowledge the contribution of the cpa branch across the devolved assembly in northern ireland scotland and wales serve as chair of the northern ireland branch of the cpa and look forward to join the hon member as an executive member of the cpa branch here it be pleasure to have my genuine friend intervene he serve honourably and nobly in the northern ireland assembly his point about the importance of the cpa branch in northern ireland and of branch across our united kingdom and the commonwealth be well make as the hon member for esher and walton monica harding note of the commonwealth member be small state and they include many island nation such as jamaica the land of my grandfather birth there be something very important about the leader of small island and small nation be at the table with the leader of country such as singapore canada new zealand australia and yes the united kingdom of great britian and northern ireland we all know that the commonwealth root go back to the british empire and that be complicated history for all of we we should not forget or airbrush out in take the step forward that this bill will help we to take we must embrace our history and our collective experience my grandfather come here to serve king and country on british passport in the we would not have beat the germans on the beach of normandy or at gallipoli without the bravery and valour of young man black white and asian from across the commonwealth or the colony as they be then today any country can join the modern commonwealth the last two country to join be gabon and togo in their admittance be interesting because neither have age old colonial tie to the united kingdom indeed there be very little that bind they with britain and that in many way prove step in the right direction there be more to do on this be very proud of my zimbabwean root but it be matter of deep personal sadness that nation that once host the commonwealth heads of government meeting in the presence of her late majesty now sit on the outside look in with membership come responsibility expectation and standard as be the case for any club or team one join that be why the bill be so important hope that the discussion on zimbabwe be give thorough and detailed hearing when the leader gather in samoa be one of few member who can claim to represent the birthplace of leader of commonwealth country the sixth prime minister of australia joseph cook start off in the labor party but end up think opposition members would enjoy that he be bear and raise in silverdale in my constituency and after leave our shore for australia he go on to hold the high role in the land it be legacy we be very proud of in newcastle under lyme couple of week ago be at st luke primary school in silverdale where there be fantastic plaque that honour the memory of

like it we can not and must not allow the bond to fray the contact to cease or let the phone call go unanswered we have see many example across africa and the caribbean and increasingly in the pacific of the chinese government have people on speed dial the perception certainly mine and in many other part of the world be that the united kingdom for at least the past year or so have fail effectively and properly to seize the opportunity that the commonwealth provide be pleased that the prime minister and the foreign secretary be both go to the pacific there be compete demand on senior colleague from all of we every day but her late majesty queen elizabeth always say that she have to be see to be believe and she be right that be why be important for the prime minister to make the admittedly long journey to the meeting our departure from the european union be mean to lead to global britain agenda and urge my hon friend the minister to make sure that that agenda become reality the bill and the commonwealth parliamentary association will help we to do that they show our ally and friend across the commonwealth that we take our relationship and our responsibility seriously that we understand the example we must set and that we be determined to build as gordon brown would put it renew commonwealth with renew purpose for new time as the hon member for south antrim robin swann note if the bill be pass colleague will engage with parliamentarian from across the commonwealth through the cpa as will in the period ahead and will have something positive to say which be important the viability and future of the commonwealth be on the line if we do not get this new relationship right the new government have lot to do to get our country back on track and this be part of it be good steward at home and good neighbour abroad be not mutually exclusive we must do both and we can do that by support the bill call jack rankin to make his maiden speech it give great pleasure to

good for the future windsor link to the royal family be self evident the conqueror first build the castle and the royal house proudly carry our name but few know that the windsor constituency be the home of monarchs long before the arrival of the norman yoke old windsor be an important palace of saxon king document as defend royal manor in edward the confessor time but evidence suggest that there be royal connection since at least the ninth century william the conqueror choose the site for windsor castle strategically important position high above the key medieval route to london on the river thames it be part of ring of motte and bailey castle around london each day march from the city and the next castle allow for easy reinforcement the first king to use windsor castle as royal residence be william son henry perhaps he be attract by the proximity of the royal hunting forest then windsor forest now windsor great park in the centre of my constituency represent most of the community around it include ascot sunninghill and sunningdale where my wife sarah and have make our family home with our son edward and christopher henry great grandson john be besiege by the baron in and sign magna carta the follow year whether it be sign north of the river in wraysbury or south on runnymede meadow be lose to time whichever the true site both be in the windsor constituency thank to the most recent boundary change and we welcome runnymede meadow into the patch together with the surrey village of englefield green and virginia water as well as the east of langley in slough whether wraysbury or runnymede it remain undeniable that there be propensity for there to be too much water in those place one of the thing will advocate for in this place be proper flood defence for datchet wraysbury horton and old windsor disgracefully if the river thames scheme be build as currently envisage those village will be the only part of the thames from taplow to the north sea that remain materially undefended what be propose as channel of the river thames scheme must be fund centrally as national strategic infrastructure this house will hear from again on that topic assure you madam deputy speaker in the handful of week have be here have already lose count of the time this place have be incorrectly refer to as the mother of misquoting of john bright it be england that bright refer to as the mother of parliaments in that speech bright be argue for what become the reform act of which for the first time enfranchise part of the urban male working class from which hail england be the mother of parliaments because of the principle establish in anglo saxon england that yes we owe our allegiance to his majesty the king then in old windsor now in new windsor but within framework that protect our ancient individual liberty as articulate in magna carta that heritage be proudly ours the saxon great councils start to be call parliaments by the century the principle underpin they among other thing that the king could only make law and raise taxation with the consent of the community of the realm now belong to the whole commonwealth and the wider free world that concept that taxation should be raise only with the consent of the community of the realm should give the new government pause for thought recommend it as good conservative instinct in this house those on the treasury bench the crown should be cautious about levy taxation especially if punitive or excessive without gain wide common counsel as this new government raise taxis in breach of their manifesto commitment my counsel would be that taxation will gain wide consent if and only if it lead to material improvement in the quality of public service that will not happen without quite radical public sector reform to drive productivity improvement which seriously urge the government to consider tax without proper consent be something that government over the year have come cropper over most famously the british in north america in the century hope our american cousin may rejoin the commonwealth one day it be often they who remember our share constitutional heritage most keenly the magna carta memorial in my constituency be erect in by the american bar association which alongside we and our commonwealth kin be the beneficiary of that great legacy assure the house that will be bring

should be inspiring to everyone who come to this country very much enjoy the maiden speech of my hon friend the member for windsor jack rankin it be tour de force on part of english history with which be not fully familiar although do not know whether that will help he in his service on the scottish affairs committee one thing we have in common be that as new member of the house be require to serve on that committee be on it for five year and it be indeed learn experience in speak in favour of the bill will concentrate my remark on the commonwealth parliamentary association be particularly pleased that the minster be take the bill forward because know he have play positive part in the working of the association and have be part of many previous delegation have also have that opportunity like the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for south antrim robin swann and for southgate and wood green bambos charalambous be pleased to have be elect to the executive of the cpa which hop to meet for the first time in its new guise this afternoon after the debate have conclude it be extremely important that we understand the significance that commonwealth country place on this change it be all very well to have discussion about the procedural nicety but this issue be impact on the united kingdom reputation within the commonwealth have twice lead delegation to south africa and this issue be top of the list of issue to be discuss by the speaker of the south african parliament when the speaker of the ghanaian parliament visit this country it be the top issue on their agenda it impede the discussion of other issue that we might want to raise so it be vital for that impediment to discussion to be remove as one or two other speaker have touch on particularly the hon member for newcastle under lyme malign force be at work when we be in south africa we be attack by the economic freedom fighters party as neo colonialist the structure of the international commonwealth parliamentary association be give as one reason we be neo colonialist because the organisation be not full stand international organisation but an english charity people use that to further their argument this bill be not just nice thing to do but vital to ensure that we can be fully participative and respect in discussion if we want to raise difficult issue there be difficult issue to raise in the commonwealth in particular the assault on the lgbt community in many commonwealth country we can not then be confront with what be you do about this issue that be important to we it be important that we be take the bill forward and undertaking be give at the last commonwealth parliamentary association international conference join other in pay tribute to colleague ian liddell grainger have step in to be the head of the international commonwealth parliamentary association have be the chair of the cpa uk when the incumbent pass away suddenly ian as those who know he will appreciate could have be diplomat in another life he be able to assure those present at the summit that something would be do in the uk and that the change would be make dame maria miller in her usual tenacious way seek to do everything possible to bring those measure forward be personally disappointed that the bill be not in the last government king speech because it be consider too niche whereas various thing that or my constituent would have consider niche do appear however dame maria pursue the bill through other channel and get so very close to it be enact be delighted that the new government have take it forward and that it get through the house of lords without undue difficulty although there be other issue to be raise around the bill hope that it can complete straightforward parliamentary passage because not only do we have the commonwealth leader event in samoa but in two week time we have the commonwealth parliamentary association conference in new south wales it will be very important in particular to as have be task with report to the conference what be happen with the bill that can report positively that the bill have pass second reading today that we have hear across the chamber that it have widespread and cross party support and that it have the government impetus behind it to deliver royal assent as soon as possible that be the message that hope and believe can take to the conference the final point would like to make to the minister be that the cpa uk branch be an asset to the government the government and in particular the fcdo need to work more closely with the branch because mps on delegation can be soft power source that the government can not be many member who have be on delegation find that post consulate embassy and high commission welcome their visit because mps be able to raise issue or ask question or they themselves be able to ask question or raise issue that they would not otherwise be able to do if it be formal ministerial event go forward ask they to work with our cpa uk branch so that we can work as effectively as we can on behalf of the united kingdom and deliver some of those soft power benefit with the leave of the house and with thank to all member who have contribute today want to reiterate the opposition support for the bill also want to repeat my tribute to my right hon friend the former member for basingstoke dame maria miller for her unending work to promote the bill and to my noble friends baroness anelay and lord ahmad for their respective role it shin positive light on this place that private member bill can be introduce support by conservative government and then reintroduce by new labour government hope we will see it complete its passage into law in the same spirit of co operation turn to today debate it be delight to serve opposite the minister of state at the foreign commonwealth and development office the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty he have genuine passion for the commonwealth and commitment to build friendship across the world be sure he will continue to do all that he can to build those friendship and ensure that the commonwealth go from success to success the chair of the international development committee the hon member for rotherham sarah champion set out not only the value but the joy that the cpa bring she be absolutely right that the icrc be an organisation of hope and that its loss those it have lose in the course of its work demonstrate just how important it be and how important it be that we support its work also thank she for remind that too should thank it for all the submission it make to the foreign affairs committee when be the chair of that committee over the last few year the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for esher and walton monica harding have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the icrc have to say that learn many thing be not aware of before the debate so thank she for that the speech by my friend the hon member for southgate and wood green bambos charalambous demonstrate the importance of the cpa work he be representation of the importance of what the cpa do for this chamber which be bring people together from across the chamber to build friendship that matter the chamber can often appear combative and to some extent rude frankly in the way that we speak to each other but behind the scene it be vital that we have the relationship that enable we to get thing do be grateful to count he as very good friend turn to my right hon friend the member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley who be sure be rush back in frenzy to the chamber from her meeting with the cpa it be quite impressive for she to make the same argument so cogently for third time and to find way to structure they so very differently pay tribute to her work on modern day slavery which be exceptional and demonstrate the importance of the cpa work she have make demonstrable difference to the way commonwealth country around the world have tackle modern day slavery within their own country congratulate the hon member for ilford south jas athwal on make his maiden speech it be quite clear that he have passion for the home that his community give he he have clear aspiration for the community he serve and wish he every success in deliver on those aspiration my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis the former chair of the intelligence and security committee set out his concern for the freedom and protection of the committee staff scrutiny be always at the forefront of his mind be sure that he be hear by the minister although be sure that his staff from the foreign commonwealth and development office in the box be even more excited to hear the news that there will be an amendment in committee the opposition will review his amendment very closely he know how closely hold the importance of scrutiny in my own heart it be very interesting to hear the challenge that he face as the committee chair in the last few year the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee speak of the commonwealth family although suspect that perhaps in prepare for today debate he accept challenge to try to get kangaroo into hansard congratulate he on do just that the maiden speech by my hon friend the member for windsor jack rankin be typical in the tribute that it pay to his predecessor it be clear that he will be passionate campaigner for civil liberty and low taxis during his time in this house but gently suggest that he may find his declare campaign to prevent third runway at heathrow at odd with the cpa own demand on the airport which be rather significant he may have to come to term with that before he apply for any future delegation the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun lillian jones apologise if that be not accurately pronounce show heartfelt gratitude to those who have support she to come to this place she bring the history of her constituency to life in her maiden speech my right hon friend the member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell demonstrate so well the courtesy of this house it be so important that as we move forward as new parliament we do not forget those small courtesy whether it be pay tribute to predecessor or recognise the contribution of other member thank he for do that he also raise the importance of the cpa when it come to the challenge and disagreement that we have within that family because like all family within the commonwealth there be disagreement my right hon friend have be vocal in his effort particularly on global lgbt right have be able to use the cpa family as an opportunity to flag my concern when there have be attack on lgbt right globally and about woman right and the way in which national security legislation sometimes can be pervert or misuse for the interest of individual although we talk about the commonwealth parliamentary association in such positive light be an important vehicle for challenge within our own community he also set out the importance of the bill to the commonwealth congratulate he on his re election and when he go to the commonwealth meeting hopefully he will be able to confirm that the bill have pass second reading that seem to be the will of the house in today discussion although would never prejudge any vote and that it be make progress through the houses the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross do vital work the cpa further the aim of the commonwealth charter to the development of free and democratic society it allow we to share good practice across border learn from one another connect with likeminde colleague in the commonwealth and sometimes not so likeminded and together strengthen our democratic resilience in an increasingly volatile world as the chair of the international development committee say the icrc be often the last line of humanity reach the most vulnerable when other can not and administrate lifesave aid each be staff and support by hard work and upright people try their good to make positive impact and etch out bright future from our stormy present the bill may seem to address minor issue in comparison to some that pass through this house none the less it be vital not just for we but for our commonwealth partner around the world many of whom be sure will be watch today debate the legal challenge in it strengthen the foundation on which the work of both the cpa and the icrc rely the bill solve two problem though my right hon friend the member for new forest east will attempt to make it solve three but its real value be in the many opportunity it will create it will be up to the government to grip those

debate on postal voting if the whip think that the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee make long speech be tempt to say you ai see nothing yet first may welcome the minister to her place assure she from the start that this be not an attack adjournment debate it really be design to be helpful to she and colleague seek to secure this debate have reflect on the operation of postal voting during the general election which do through the prism of be the then minister in charge of election policy just for the record note that mr speaker have kindly invite to join the speaker committee on the electoral commission and have accept if the house will indulge for just moment want to put on record one of those thing that often do not get note when ministers be usher out of office by the electorate this place all of we who have be return to it all who stand in the election and represent their party interest across the united kingdom and all our electorate owe debt of thank to the election team at the former department for levelling up housing and communities see one or two of they in the officials box the team work flat out to deliver the policy that come from the elections act and they have the local election in may and then the general election shortly thereafter they work tirelessly to support the delivery of those election and put on record my thank to they also thank david gold and his team at the royal mail and all the people at the royal mail who strove so hard to deliver the postal vote and all the other literature and documentation that support the delivery of general election david and his team be more than generous with their time and during the election campaign as issue be come to the fore that they be try to manage and we be try to raise as the government they make themselves available on daily basis if necessary and certainly on weekly basis to make sure that the ship of state be still afloat it would be remiss of not to thank the association of electoral administrators and all those in local government who keep the electoral register and deal with the paperwork and the logistic which certainly become more complex and demanding as the minister will doubtless have be brief by her official as result of the change to the rule and regulation in the elections act have the great honour of speak at the annual conference early this year be sure that the minister will be invite to do it if she can urge she to and they be great bunch of woman and man who work tirelessly in our town hall and county hall to make sure that election be deliver of course we should also thank the electoral commission which be the guardian watchdog that keep an eye over all of we to make sure that the rule be adhere to our democracy work only when and because the defeated and their supporter not the victor accept the result we see the danger of that in the previous american presidential election and just how close we can get to anarchy and complete collapse of confidence the ramification of which be still be feel in the states when the people who lose say we be rob the system be against we we have be hugely lucky in this country that all our election result have be beyond challenge and have be accept by the victor and the defeat and that the legitimacy of those who have be choose to govern have be accept and agree but we can not rest on our laurel we can not presume that just because that be how it have always be that be how it will always be and that be the spur that prompt to apply for this adjournment debate my message to the minister be that although seem long way away in governance and organisational term it be effectively tomorrow the government and the house need to think about whether and how any change be to be deliver to the way that postal voting operate such as through amendment to the elections act or statutory instrument to ensure that the electorate accept the legitimacy of the result the next general election will not be fight on the same franchise that we have this year we have an age population so it be legitimate presumption that there will be high demand for postal vote as people get old there be also the potential to increase the franchise by give the vote to year old which could increase future demand for postal vote and understand that proposal may be in train about franchise right for eu citizen which would create another demand if all the newly enfranchise overseas voter have register to vote who be hitherto exempt because of the year cut off point who would by definition be seek postal vote or proxy vote the totality of additional voter come on to the roll be give this figure from memory would have be about million do not know what percentage of that million get on to the register and have vote the electoral commission report about the operation of the election will be publish in november as sure as egg be egg though as time go by their legitimacy to vote be accept by my then shadow the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi so there will be no change in policy there one can only presume that great percentage of those million will apply for vote as their knowledge and understanding of their ability to secure one grow will the hon gentleman give way be tempt to say that this adjournment debate would not be an adjournment debate it would fail the trade descriptions act unless give way to the hon member for strangford jim shannon commend the hon gentleman for bring this debate forward he be absolutely right to bring this issue to the floor of the house for consideration by the minister would like to make helpful contribution he be very knowledgeable in relation to northern ireland we have have postal vote system for some time but there be problem at the last election when people be take ill suddenly the doctor in the hospital could right away send letter and those people be accept for postal vote however those in their late and who be infirm and perhaps not so mobile be not able to get postal vote even though they need they because for some unknown reason their gps take decision not to sign their form for postal vote to that be absolutely ludicrous if you be elderly and infirm and not able to get out you should get postal vote there should be no two tier status for those with postal vote certainly agree with the hon gentleman that all those who be entrust with the discharge and delivery of our election our police our medical certifier and other clearly play part should play an active and engage part it should not be an option to opt out this should just be an accepted part of the job will mention northern ireland specifically in moment or so want to give the house some fact provide by the royal mail which think be of interest to put this issue into scope and scale at the general election just go on july the royal mail deliver more postal vote and candidate mail than in any previous general election postal vote be up by and candidate literature be up by in comparison with and that be just your election literature madam deputy speaker the royal mail deliver million poll card million postal vote and million candidate leaflet it do sweep of all its mail centre and delivery office to ensure that all the postal vote that have go into the system be deliver to the count to make sure that those vote be count on election day itself postal vote be handle by the royal mail across the united kingdom to be deliver that be huge number this be the challenge that set for the minister be not look for the de facto answer today but would like an assurance that it be on the radar and people be think about it we know full well that the royal mail be go through period of change think we feel this particularly acutely in rural area it be by definition because of email and everything else handle few and few letter and staff number reflect that one of the joy of the general election as far as royal mail be concern be the fact that we still have the fix term parliaments act and it could structure additional recruitment to deliver the demand and that demand be far less than that which prevail at the moment because it know with certainty when the general election be go to be hold the snap election of and and the perhaps early than expect election catch the royal mail napping because it have to put on sudden spurt to recruit people to deliver all the piece of paper that need to be deliver in the absence of the fix term parliaments act that issue will remain with we make the point to the royal mail that in fact only one election be control by the fixed term parliaments act every other election have always be at the whim or the prerogative of the prime minister when the house be dissolve however in compare previous with future general election we must consider the change in volume that the royal mail be handle mention rural area be still await the delivery of election address be sure that have exciting word to say but it never come through my letterbox last week wonderful bundle of piece of mail be deliver in the one delivery week service that my part of north dorset be currently experience there will not be member of parliament urban or rural though this apply particularly to rural area who have not have constituent contact they after the general election to say that they do not receive their postal vote in time or could not get it back in time that take to point that require possibly secondary legislation and certainly some think the cut off point between the close of nomination and everything go to the printer and everything get bundle up in the postal vote pack at the same time as people be try to update the register check that polling station be available recruit polling clerk and so on it be all incredibly tight it be incredibly tight this year but the system just about cop be anxious to future proof give the increase demand that mention at the start of my remark the government could go back to the old system thus put the postal vote genie back in the bottle with the tight criterion that use to prevail do not believe that that will happen and do not think it would be desirable we could introduce digital voting for overseas voter but that have the potential for fraud and hacking it also open up the pandora box of digital voting for everyone in the united kingdom there be no easy solution there be the tightness of the timetable and the capacity of the royal mail not its good will the royal mail be honour and delight to have the contract that the government give it david gold and his team be conscious of the pivotal role that their organisation play in deliver the general election and always prepare to say so up front the electoral commission note in briefing that receive today in advance of the debate for which be grateful that several people experience problem in voting by post such as delay in receive their postal ballot its research show that the vast majority of postal vote be deliver promptly and that there be no widespread or systemic issue however there be voter in the uk and abroad who could not vote because of the late arrival of postal vote problem be prevalent in scotland which give we lot of concern because the election coincide with the school holiday there and in northern ireland which create additional pressure for the postal voting system look forward as be sure that the minister do to the electoral commission report on postal voting which will be publish next month something need to be do to give we all confidence that the result of the general election in probably will have the same legitimacy as those hold in and previously there will be some challenge although our constituent be not force to vote they have legitimate expectation as part of their contract with the state that their vote will be count if it have be cast do not have the answer for the minister that be her job not mine she know that the system need to be reliable robust easy seamless and trust because all of we irrespective of party or geography be unite in be motivate by one guide principle the result whatever it may be have to command authority through the electorate trust in it if it do not if people can cry foul say that the system be load against they or that it be too creaky and analogue for digital age then faith in our democratic system erode when faith erode participation be likely to decline that be when extreme always flourish and know that his majesty government and the minister will not want that look forward to hear what the minister have to say for what it be worth have be the minister over the election period would be happy to do anything can with she through conversation et cetera to ensure that we get this right my hon friend be make an interesting and powerful speech he refer to the number of item deliver by royal mail and say that it be go through period of change do we need to look for alternative to royal mail because of the major change that be take place if my hon friend mean alternative to foot on the pavement then very possibly the benefit of use the royal mail be that culturally it be aware of the seriousness of the task it be ask to discharge and it have very good heritage of do so would not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater sympathise with the royal mail because in essence it be give five week to recruit hundred of people across the country to learn the round and deliver stuff those people also have to be vet to ensure that they be not politically partial so that my leaflet do not end up in hedge while everybody else end up deliver through people letterboxe those be important issue there be tendency to rush off into the commercial sector but would not do that of course there be way to ensure vetting but the authority and imprimatur of royal mail put it at distinct advantage know that it want to continue to undertake the task not just because the contract it have with the minister and the department be commercially attractive but because it see itself as be part of the democratic fabric and network that sustain the election could have wait until to raise these issue but then the minister could have say the hon member for north dorset make some very valid point but he will know that there be no time in the legislative timetable to address they we will just have to try and muddle through the minister have at least few year to talk to the parliamentary business and legislation cabinet committee her whip and the leader of the house and assess whether tweak and change need to be make to election cut off date and timetable will not labour the point any far but the electoral process need to be robust and the outcome must be trust by all our citizen irrespective of whether they vote or how they vote thank the former minister the hon member for north dorset simon hoare for secure the debate and bring the very important topic of election to the attention of the house particularly welcome the expertise and experience he bring to the discussion which be helpfully take place at the beginning of the parliament as he point out in the previous government he be minister for election the effective run of our electoral process be the foundation of our democracy and it be right that we carefully monitor and review all aspect of delivery to identify emerge issue and area for improvement like the hon gentleman express my gratitude to all those who work tirelessly to deliver the recent general election include return officer electoral registration officer and their team across the country this be an important debate in the context of an election that be deliver effectively and in which voter could exercise their right freely the country have collective confidence in the result although there will always be lesson to be identify and improvement to be make the success of the poll should not be take for grant or go unacknowledged also thank the wide sector that support the system the printer the supplier the royal mail the police the electoral commission and of course the hon gentleman for his tireless work he deserve great credit for effectively marshal government resource to aid the delivery of this complex operation the government be aware of the report that arise in the medium of postal voting delay at the recent general election and the point that the hon member have make although the vast majority of postal vote be deliver successfully it be perhaps not surprising in an operation of this scale and complexity that proportion of postal vote should encounter delay those delay happen despite the work do by the minister and other ahead of the general election that be the case in previous election too official work closely with the royal mail and return officer to support the resolution of the issue as quickly and effectively as possible none the less any instance of an elector be unable to vote due to delay or error in the system be deeply regrettable and we need to take step to address the root cause postal voting as the hon member point out have become increasingly popular there be general trend towards more of the electorate choose this voting option at the general election more than million postal vote be issue and report suggest that the figure for be significantly high that put printing and delivery system under strain especially when national poll and election be call at short notice the issue arise in also have to be see against the backdrop of boundary change we recognise that no system will be perfect at all time but it be clear from the volume of incident and from feedback from the election sector and elector themselves that there be major strain on the system and improvement will need to be make we will carefully assess the postal voting process in our wide review of electoral conduct and registration process which the government have already begin we will work closely with stakeholder across the sector to gather their feedback analysis and idea be very grateful to the former minister for his offer of assistance this be an incredibly important matter and be very keen to make sure that we draw on his expertise and work the electoral commission will publish its final report on the general election later this year and we will carefully consider its finding and recommendation be very grateful to the hon lady not just for what she be say about the issue but for her very kind word she have make former minister blush in her conversation with the sector she know that those be vital conversation will she overlay the project figure for elector in the next election or will she use the figure clearly if the change that the government be suggest be deliver the franchise will be large that be an important point on which would like clarity guess probably know the answer we will look at these issue in the round the hon member have make important point about the growth in the sector and shall come on to that as have say we will look at the finding of the electoral commission report when they arrive once we have complete our review we will bring forward firm proposal for improvement to our electoral system and look forward to discuss they with member in due course the hon gentleman express other concern we recognise the important work that royal mail have carry out we will need to look at that in the context of royal mail parent company and potential takeover and consider any wide implication to make sure that the system be robust and that there be appropriate support not only so that royal mail can learn for future election and improve on what be do in recent election but so that resource be in place and we continue to maintain confidence in the system the hon gentleman make an important point about rural area as well those factor need to be consider along with other point he make the hon gentleman make important point about an age population and demographic change as well as young voter and the increase popularity of some way of voting work need to take into account change in behaviour and voting pattern as say look forward to work with he on those important issue the hon member for strangford jim shannon speak about northern ireland and make check the northern ireland office have hear of gps not sign off postal vote but that have never be back by specific evidence we will however take that issue into account and look into it along with any other barrier face those who need or wish to vote with postal ballot let say in the spirit of consensus in which the hon member for north dorset introduce the debate and make his speech that look forward to work closely with he thank he for secure this important debate and other member for their intervention and for contribute their insight and expertise the government consider the effective run of election to be of paramount importance it be fundamental to trust and confidence in our democracy as we announce early this month we be review carefully electoral conduct and registration process once the review be complete we will bring forward firm proposal for change where they be necessary very much look forward to share those proposal with members and to work with the hon member for north dorset question put and agree to house adjourn
