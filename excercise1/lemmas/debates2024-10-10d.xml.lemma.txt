history from investor scar taxis to the right hon lady hit the brake on our transport infrastructure pipeline with northern powerhouse rail the midlands rail hub and road upgrade across the country all on hold growth require investment and investment require confidence will she give some to the business look to invest to the contractor wait to get start and crucially to the community that so badly need these upgrade wonder whether the hon lady have speak to any business or infrastructure provider over the past year who have suffer appalling uncertainty and lack of confidence her government preside over billion of pound of waste and failure in the delivery of infrastructure and have cost our economy hundred of billion of pound be expect the right hon lady to say something along the line of wait for the budget or wait for the spending review as we have hear many time during this question session however she do not wait for the budget to give union massive pay rise to re announce our plan to get to euston or to signal billion of pound for new light if she can make those decision before the budget surely she can confirm that every penny of investment that we have commit to transport through network north will continue to be invest in our country transport structure the hon lady can wait for the budget dangerous driving be major concern particularly follow

future of and crucially about its cost control be pleased to hear that the secretary of state have say that unlike the previous hapless government she will prevent another scandal such as the sudden sacking of ferry employee two year ago will she please outline what step she intend to take to stop anything like that ever happen again be very grateful to my hon friend for her question the previous

sense for the hon lady constituent for visitor and for the economy as whole one hundred and fifty parish in devon write to devon county council last year ask for mph zone but only six be successful those that be not successful be tell that they could pursue the measure through so call community self delivery my constituent think but this be what we pay our council tax for do the secretary of state understand that be very grateful for the hon gentleman question it be absolutely my position that if local resident want to design and support local measure around speeding and road safety they should be support to do so by their local authority university freedom of speech urgent question to ask the secretary of state if she will make statement on freedom of speech in university it be labour government who enshrine in law the right to freedom of expression and it be labour government who will again uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom on our university campus not through create culture war but through work with academic student and campaigner to get the legislation right the secretary of state write to colleague and make write statement on july on her decision to pause further commencement of the higher education freedom of speech act in order to consider option we have hear concern from minority group and other that that act and its implementation may have unintended consequence and result in disproportionate burden for university and student union many be concerned that it could push provider to overlook the safety and wellbeing of minority group over fear of sanction and costly action want to provide the house with reassurance that this government believe that high education must be space for robust discussion that expose both student and academic to challenge idea the decision to pause the act be make precisely because of the importance of get this legislation right the secretary of state indicate in her write statement that she would confirm her long term plan for the act as soon as possible since then official and ministers have engage with wide range of stakeholder on the future of the act this include representative of high education provider and academic include those from the committee for academic freedom academics for academic freedom and the london universities council for academic freedom those official and ministers will continue to engage with stakeholder before any final decision be make call the shadow secretary of state this evening member of this house be due to speak at an event at cambridge university that event will not go ahead as plan because of safety concern it be absolutely not for we to question operational decision making but it absolutely be for we to question this government about legislation and the effect direct indirect and chilling of the decision they have make since come to office last year the higher education freedom of speech act become law in the end have attract cross party support after extensive work with student and academic it pass all its stage in parliament and receive royal assent that act be about protect free speech on campus include for visit speaker and it be about academic freedom to challenge conventional wisdom and put forward unpopular and controversial opinion however in july this year the new secretary of state decide without any parliamentary debate not to commence that act the minister speak about wide range of stakeholder some academic include seven nobel prize laureate have write to the secretary of state in support of the legislation do the secretary of state really think that those academic would support that legislation if it be as the government put it tory hate charter will she now agree to meet those academic and will she please now do the right thing and commence the legislation that parliament have pass this government be absolutely committed to freedom of speech the secretary of state pause the further implementation of the act to consider option and ensure we get the legislation right and she will confirm as soon as possible the plan for the act and long term plan for the continuation of freedom of speech in high education the high education sector minority group and union represent staff on campus have raise concern about the act believe it to be disproportionate burdensome and damaging to the welfare of student and fear that sanction could result in minority group concern be overlook mp and peer raise whole range of these concern during the bill passage by step back from the legislation to reflect on which of the measure introduce be need the government be take pragmatic approach to ensure that high education remain space for constructive dialogue and home for diverse opinion it should not be battleground for ideological clash we be consider the next step take on board the shadow secretary of state request for the secretary of state to meet those he mention she have hold range of meeting with all group that have concern and want say in how this consideration continue be sure that she will have further meeting and will pass on his specific request university and academic freedom be vital to the intellectual and economic health of this country free speech be mention in our manifesto early this year but there be no mention of this particular decision which be make day after the secretary of state take office sadly therefore find it difficult to support this decision on that basis alone can the minister tell whether when she talk about burdensome issue she mean the chinese government threaten to withdraw resource from our major university because think that be at the bottom of the pressure that be unduly put on the secretary of state have hear my hon friend and recognise his point however can absolutely reassure he that that be not factor in make this decision it be very much about ensure that we take the time to consider option for the future of this act and make sure that we get it right it be because we believe in uphold freedom of expression and freedom of speech in our world class high education sector that we want to get this legislation right and that be why we be consider the option we will continue to listen to and meet all group that have an interest in uphold freedom of speech there be those who support measure in the act and those who have concern about measure in the act we will continue to consult and will report back on plan as soon as possible call the liberal democrat spokesperson freedom of speech be fundamentally about the freedom to inquire about and explore idea fact and datum that be sometimes difficult and sometimes inconvenient and it be the lack of fact and datum and even of much of an idea that fail to convince the liberal democrats of the need for the higher education freedom of speech act it be not base on evidence and it be not proportionate and the government decision to halt its implementation be welcome however we should take legitimate concern seriously and we should not ignore those that exist within jewish community include in university what work be the minister undertaking to ensure that jewish staff and student feel safe and welcome in our community especially in our university welcome the hon gentleman comment and recognise much within they the rise in antisemitic abuse on high education campus be deeply concern and this government take it extremely seriously we regularly meet universities uk to discuss what support university be offer to jewish student on campus and how they be tackle antisemitic abuse we also regularly meet the union of jewish students the university jewish chaplaincy and the community security trust and we will continue to do so to make sure that we get this right can the minister reflect on the dire inheritance in education particularly in the high education sector my hon friend raise an important point about the wide landscape and the challenge face our high education sector our university be not just vital for uphold freedom of expression freedom of speech academic debate and rigour they be also incredible seat of opportunity that must be unleash up and down this country we will continue to do everything we can to support economic growth which we know be support by high education and indeed by the whole of education the government be commit to that unleashing of opportunity the secretary of state have say that she want to listen to different view and the minister have talk about the number of meeting that have take place so will she commit to meet the delegation of senior jewish academic lead by professor david abulafia who have already write request such meeting the right hon gentleman be absolutely right we be absolutely committed to consult with wide range of interest in order to get this legislation right and will certainly pass on his request to the minister with responsibility for high education who lead on this work do my hon friend agree that the real threat to academic freedom be cut to academic subject and job insecurity two issue that the conservative party ignore time and again when in government my hon friend raise an important point and it go back to what say previously this debate be very important it be important that we have the right framework for freedom of expression and speech within our education system and particularly that academic rigour that benefit from have the freedom to be challenge and to challenge view that should be hear and debate she be also right that university be the powerhouse to opportunity across the country and we need to ensure that be unleash in every part be fellow north east mp and we know how important our university be in our region to unleash that opportunity and we want to see that unleash across the country mr speaker apologise for my hoarse voice have be silence the reason that this legislation be bring forward in the first place be that so many academic be fearful of be able to speak in those institution they do not believe they have the freedom to express idea and view and they be be silence by other academic that be why the legislation be bring forward it be shocking that an act of parliament pass by this house and give royal assent be just to be cast aside without member of parliament first have an opportunity to vote on whether they agree with that will the hon lady therefore commit to give this house say on whether that will be allow to happen commend the right hon gentleman for his valiant effort today to uphold his right to speak on this issue recognise the challenge of ensure that we have take the time to get this right because we want to protect freedom of speech and we need to ensure that this legislation and any legislation assist in that and do not impede it we also recognise and support the exist duty on high education provider to support and secure lawful freedom of speech as currently set out in the education act it remain in force for office for student registration condition he be right that we need to get this right that need to be uphold and have this discussion today support that push to ensure that freedom of speech be uphold as the act to which he refer pass through this house and be consider and as it be now far consider that shed more light on the importance of uphold freedom of speech and he have contribute to that again today in the week that we mark the dark anniversary of october may say that welcome this government take these measure to ensure the safety of jewish student on campus do the minister agree that this show that this government truly believe that regardless of their religion student should be able to get on with their study without concern for their safety absolutely agree with my hon friend and think that the same principle apply through every aspect of education and childhood and in every aspect of society too as government we stand with those upholding and secure those right our university have to be an avenue where individual can speak and be challenge the reality be that there be nothing new to freedom of speech remember as president of student union constantly have to fight for the right for people to express their view even when totally disagree with they the sad reality be that jewish student and jewish academic feel threaten right now by antisemite let we call they out for what they be when they must be free to exercise freedom of speech will the minister in this consideration make sure that those right be uphold in whatever the government come forward with know that the hon gentleman work hard in this space do not disagree with word he have say university must be space for robust discussion and that be why we have pause the roll out of the act he be right that antisemitism and holocaust denial be abhorrent and there must be no space for they that be why we have pause the legislation we must ensure that we get the balance right between freedom of speech and uphold the right for minority group and other to have their lawful right to freedom of expression as they should previous conservative education ministers be on the record state that this flawed legislation could allow those spread hate and extremism to seek compensation under its measure do my hon friend agree that it be right that we look again at this issue in order to avoid those dangerous consequence my hon friend raise an important point which be why we be currently talk to people with range of view include those supportive of the provision in the act we be listen to the concern of minority group and other that the act could encourage university and college to overlook the safety and wellbeing of minority because of fear of complaint and costly legal action push they towards allow abhorrent hate speech that be why we be consider this legislation we need to get this right can the minister give we any specific example of scenario with which the government be confront by these people who have successfully lobby for pause other than just speak in general term about the legislation be disproportionate appreciate the right hon gentleman thoughtful question can not give he specific example today the principle that we be work to be that we be look in great detail at all aspect and all concern that have be raise as well as supportive comment in relation to the act and what it seek to achieve will pass his question on to the minister for high education and skill and ask she to respond accordingly student politic be often malign in this place and often rightly so however in attend the conference of the national union of students and vote that hizb ut tahrir should be no platforme it be the right thing to do clearly the conservatives agree because in january this year they proscribe hizb ut tahrir as terrorist organisation do my hon friend agree that the conservatives position be in fact charter for hizb ut tahrir holocaust denier and vaccine denier to wander our university freely my hon friend express passionate view on this subject which do incite passionate view because it be fundamental freedom that we must protect and uphold that be why we be take the time to ensure that we get this right and uphold lawful freedom of expression and freedom of speech in our high education system while not give space for unlawful speech that go beyond robust debate recently attend university in birmingham and witness large protest in relation to the palestinian issue attend by both people of faith and no faith include jewish student they be protest peacefully while we accept that there have be rise in antisemitism there have also be rise in islamophobic hate at university will the minister confirm that whatever consultation take place she will feed back report on they to the house thank the hon gentleman for his contribution he be absolutely right will make that commitment which will pass on to the minister for skills and to the secretary of state before be elect to this place be university lecturer and teacher work hard as do my colleague to ensure that in my lecture hall all view could be express interrogate and debate even those that profoundly disagree with do the minister agree that when opposition member make unsubstantiated claim that student who express tory view be mark down it order think that the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy and for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew be both try to catch my eye assure you that that be not the way to do it do the minister agree that when opposition member make unsubstantiated claim that tory student be be mark down it undermine the brilliant hard work that our lecturer do to support their student my hon friend make an important point the government will uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom on our university campus robust debate and challenge to view help student to grow in an education setting create culture war do not that be why we will work with academic student campaigner and all those with an interest in uphold freedom of speech in our high education system to get this right be freedom of speech not an absolute freedom and right will the government not do something to bring vice chancellor to account for their failure to deliver freedom of speech on university campus fifty five year ago be the victim of that when the vice chancellor of the university that be attend try to prevent as chairman of the conservative association from invite then prominent member of this house of commons to the university campus the vice chancellor be eventually force to stand down write what be then lead letter in the daily telegraph the vice chancellor be sham into change his view and the visit take place do that not show that the key to this be have vice chancellor who really believe in freedom of speech the hon gentleman have demonstrate well the exist duty on high education provider to secure lawful freedom of speech and indeed the right of citizen to ensure that it be uphold he make an important point that be why we be talk to people with whole range of view on the issue to ensure that we get it right under the office for students draft guidance some university have say they will have to revoke their adoption of the international holocaust remembrance alliance definition of antisemitism for fear that it might contravene the legislation do my hon friend agree that that highlight why it be so important to get the legislation right and that it be right to be cautious about how we implement any such legislation my hon friend make the point well the department be absolutely committed to uphold the ihra definition as well as challenging and educate on issue that range of hon member have raise today we need to have robust education system that inform and create healthy debate on these issue but it must also be lawful and protect the freedom of speech of those express lawful view do the minister believe that cancel culture and no platforming be problem do she believe they be get bad she have mention that this be important why then will she not set out concrete timetable for the introduction of this new legislation appreciate the hon gentleman desire to see these change however we want to take the time to get this right we be absolutely committed to free speech have say that number of time and we want to take time to ensure that we protect it in the good way possible if the higher education freedom of speech act have be implement as would have happen under the last government to timetable over the summer the situation at the university of cambridge probably would not have occur nor would the situation in durham in which the university debating society the durham union society have be keep out of the student union fair would the hon lady reflect on the fact that this delay be have an impact on freedom of speech in university across the country understand her concern but surely speed be of the essence if we be to ensure freedom of speech in our university respectfully disagree many concern be express that unintended consequence of the act would create disproportionate burden and that be why we have pause it to step back and to reflect on whether the measure introduce by the act be need we absolutely know that it be necessary to uphold freedom of speech provision on freedom of expression still exist in legislation and will be uphold and we need to make sure that we have the space to have constructive dialogue on these issue rather than battleground for ideological clash we be consider the next step and will report in due course when the minister consider whatever come next after the higher education freedom of speech act will she consider the business of foreign funding for international student their scholarship and research institute in particular will she ensure that no test or condition be impose by other state on international scholarship bursary and funding for research institute the hon gentleman tempt into much broad discussion on high education we recognise the challenge but also the opportunity in this sector be sure the minister for skills will be listen to the hon gentleman concern and consider they as part of the wide work on ensure we support our high and further education sector in the good way which be what they deserve will the minister outline how the government will ensure that enshrine freedom of speech mean enshrine freedom to believe and to express one belief without fear or favour how will the government ensure that student with deeply held faith or who hold true to biological science be entitle to discuss their belief on gender ideology and indeed every facet of student life without fear or favour yes give the hon gentleman that reassurance it be for that reason that we be pause and make sure that we get this legislation right freedom of speech and academic freedom be too important to approach in anything other than consider pragmatic and consensual way appreciate the minister constructive tone she say that she do not want this to be culture war issue when the pause be announce by the secretary of state special adviser in her department describe the higher education freedom of speech act to the medium as tory hate speech charter will the minister disown those comment have be very clear that we need to take constructive approach and to listen to all view on this issue we need to protect freedom of speech and academic expression and that include robust debate where necessary and challenging view that we may not want to hear we be listen and we be determined to get this right the higher education freedom of speech act be not government scheme that be be pause but an act of parliament that have receive royal assent it be very serious decision to stop that in its track so it must have be base on serious evidence will the minister set out that evidence give the need to defend freedom of speech be now how long will the process take agree that this be serious issue and it be serious and important decision to make we need to have the right foundation in place to secure free speech in the long term in high education we will consult all the group with an interest in ensure that we get this right we be listen to those who be concerned about the act and its implication we be also listen to those who support many of the measure in the act and would like action to be take to ensure freedom of speech in high education it be because of the seriousness of this issue that we have step back to ensure that we take that pragmatic long term approach business of the house will the leader of the house update the house on the

impact assessment in response to write parliamentary question from one of my colleague but just few day after the vote they slip out that assessment via freedom of information request that deny member of parliament the chance to see the impact assessment before voting presumably because the government want to disguise from their own back benchers the fact that over of disabled pensioner will lose their winter fuel payment the failure to disclose key information to this house appear to to be breach of section of the ministerial code first will the leader of the house apologise to the house for hide that information before the critical vote and will she ask the independent adviser on ministers interest to investigate that as potential breach of the ministerial code if she will not then will

than home may not be deliver secondly council that be long way into develop or review their local plan such as chelmsford city council be extremely concerned that they will miss the arbitrary national planning policy framework transition period deadline by just matter of week that will render all the expensive work that they have do on their plan null and void thereby threaten the delivery of thousand of home and leave developer free for all in the absence of valid local plan specifically plan authority desperately need the government to extend the transition period in the new nppf to at

authority should have more power to regulate the dockless bike rental market my hon friend do indeed have great surname he be absolutely right that bike can be blight and challenge and there be safety issue the government be currently consider these issue and we have introduce the product regulation and metrology bill that will consider some of these matter far so be sure there will be plenty of debate during the recess have the privilege of visit elliott hudson college an outstanding institution deliver excellent education in my constituency the student have some fairly tough question for the future be very bright in leeds south west and morley but my question today be about the decision to pause and review the cancellation of the apply general qualification and specifically the impact of that on the ability of college such as elliott hudson to plan for the future the review be absolutely the right course of action for the government to take but will the leader of the house provide time for this house to be update on its progress so that education institution such as of elliott hudson can have some clarity on what qualification they can offer next year as know from my own constituency this matter be raise with member regularly by further education college the government have pause the plan defunding of those qualification which mean that qualification be again available to learner the review be take place as quickly as possible hope we will publish it before christmas and can guarantee that there will be statement to this house at that time be sad to inform the house that my colleague and friend councillor linda maloney mbe pass away recently she serve the local community in st helens for year as councillor and she be trailblazer on the merseyside fire and rescue authority she be formidable woman strong labour woman and an inspiration to many people include will the leader of the house join in send condolence to her husband mike and family could she find time for debate on the importance and value of community campaigner and councillor such as linda to recognise the difference they make to community up and down the country linda maloney sound like wonderful woman who serve her community in st helens brilliantly over long period it be very welcome reminder of the important role that our councillor volunteer and community activist play in make sure that our community be the good place in which to live and work the murder of mark noke in my constituency last year in terrible case of mistaken identity when drug gang go to the wrong address be heartbreaking and senseless tragedy especially for his family whom meet recently although justice be serve with seven conviction believe that the experience of the family throughout the trial could have be improve will the leader of the house set out how this house can monitor the new victims and prisoners act to ensure that its provision be implement and will she advise how the voice of bereaved family such as my constituent can be hear in that process be sorry to hear of the tragic case that my hon friend have outline and my condolence go to the love one of mark noke we be

bawtry and those organisation on raise awareness of this massively important issue and of the importance of note and identify the symptom of breast cancer early my hon friend might attract some other

we launch in the century before those be the word of the former prime minister sir john major and they still ring true today the conservative party have maintain his commitment to our athlete from the grassroot all the way to the elite athlete compete at the international level before move on to talk about the conservatives proud record of support uk sport must highlight the crucial role of national lottery funding the national lottery establish by conservative government have fund elite level sport for more than three decade in fact from to the national lottery donate million to the

the pack in swimming cycling and so many other sport alongside the fantastic commonwealth games in both and which have combine to inspire new generation of athlete to greatness on our watch whereas labour deliver the so call austerity olympics in we deliver the good olympic game for generation personally believe they be the good that the world have ever see who can forget the incredible opening ceremony and the role play by her late majesty queen elizabeth ii the conservatives commit more than billion so that as nation we could ensure that the game be the most inspiring for our constituent that they could be despite the financial challenge inherit from the labour government in the then prime minister lord cameron correctly believe that host the olympics would secure range of benefit over and above the intrinsic impact on sport embrace trade regeneration and national wellbeing he be undoubtedly correct after we deliver the london olympic games for the nation and the world we promise not to stop there we commit to deliver an olympics legacy that the country could be proud of for the decade follow the game in five key area the hon member be talk about the post london olympics legacy one legacy be that the amount of physical education teach in in school go down by hour under his government and the gap between the number of state school and independent school do team sport rocket be the real legacy of his government not that school sport be massively diminish and should he not actually be apologise for their record in that regard it be only matter of time before those on the labour benches come out swing what would say be that we could look at the record of the previous labour government who sell off sport pitch and have much long debate about whose legacy be bad the previous conservative government begin to deliver on the olympics promise right away the department for digital culture media and sport report living legacy sport policy and investment confirm that million more people be play sport once week than when london win the olympic bid under labour in to build out that significant improvement we back our up and come athlete with

fantastic sport but key life skill community across the country have also benefit from the last government community ownership fund which help save more than pub sport club art venue and other precious community space also we must not forget the million lionesses future fund which be help to provide opportunity for the next generation of lionesses that million be be use to build approximately new state of the art pitch and accompany facility the site will be design to prioritise woman and girl team across england importantly the prominence of female athlete such as the lionesses dame kelly holmes and dame jessica ennis hill have help to increase the number of woman in england who participate in sport and physical activity that legacy continue with more woman participate than do eight year ago of course there be more to do but the steady improvement in participation show that create the legacy of the london game be marathon not sprint it be not often that will be positive about arsenal but the prime minister will be pleased that arsenal woman team be lead the way in woman football role model such as leah williamson be help attendance at the emirates to grow to record level the woman team sell out the emirates several time last season and average attendance at their game be well than at premier league club as we move on from the paris game and turn towards los angeles in another round of great british athlete will inspire more of the next generation while nothing will compare to the home game deliver by my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt and boris johnson as mayor of london the most recent game will surely be springboard allow new generation of athlete to begin their ascendancy to the peak of world sport the official opposition will hold the government foot to the fire to ensure that they support our athlete all the way from sunday league to the premier league so that they continue to perform at the pinnacle of world sport as they have over the past year in do so we remember the crucial role that sport play in our community and for our health agree with the minister comment on that hope that

much more than just free ticket have little tip for the shadow minister for future speech my husband david and daughter farah be arsenal fan it be great pleasure to speak in the debate may associate myself with the speech make by my hon friend the minister she speak eloquently about the importance of sport to man and woman boy and girl and particularly to disabled people everyone as well as about the lifelong benefit that sport can give hope that the whole house will support her endeavour on this important subject in the time available to many other colleague want to speak will cover three area first want to pay tribute to paralympians and olympians after the summer success secondly will highlight some of the wonderful achievement of local sportsman and woman from the read area and the importance of grassroots sport in our community finally will call for the owner of read football club to speed up the sale of the club which be huge local issue and thank my hon friend for her unstinting support on this important matter start with the amazing success of our local paralympians at this summer paralympic game mention in particular gregg stevenson paralympic rower who train in caversham where the british rowing base be gregg have be through enormous challenge in life yet he win gold for gb in the mix double scull he suffer disability in while he be member of the commando squadron in the royal engineers through bomb blast in afghanistan which cause he to lose both leg he have come back from that tragedy to become paralympic rower it be important to remember the contribution of our service personnel as well as other disabled sportspeople what an amazing achievement for he while have the opportunity would also like to mention ed fuller another paralympic rower training locally who attend the university of reading he be one of the crew who win gold for paralympicsgb in the mixed coxed four event in paris also praise will arnott paralympian from our community who play boccia an unusual precision ball sport similar to bowl but less well know for his hard work and dedication and his success this summer our paralympians be all wonderful ambassador for sport thank they from the bottom of my heart for their work for paralympicsgb to raise the profile of the paralympics and para sport in general among young and old people both in the read area and across

reading she be well know high jumper who have represent gb on many occasion also mention our wonderful grassroots sport can not do justice to all of they but thank our local team in football hockey cricket and many other sport for their endure work at the grassroot in sense have to declare an interest my family and have benefit from it turn briefly to read football club let tell the story of what have happen and call for action from the owner mr dai yongge who have delay sell the club which have cause huge problem for fan player and the club reading be one of the old club in the football league yet it be in real difficulty we have have successful career and an illustrious history over many year include two spell in the premiership the highest ever point tally achieve in the championship and numerous other success sadly we have never get to an fa cup final but we have have some amazing cup run yet unfortunately our club have fall into difficult period because of irresponsible ownership read case be similar to that of number of other club as know from work with colleague be glad to see that the previous government football governance bill have be bring back by our front bench team and hope that soon become law and deal with the problem of irresponsible ownership which have be experience across the country by number of club many of they in medium sized town and city know other colleague have strong feeling about that before call for action from mr yongge point out how difficult this situation have be the reason why the club have be so badly affect by his ownership be repeat financial mismanagement he fail to pay his majesty revenue and customs on time and as result point be deduct mean that reading be relegate from the championship to league one that be not because of anything that happen on the pitch that be grossly unfair on the club the player and local fan it be completely and utterly unacceptable the same thing could happen to other club in the football league in exactly the same way due to the same issue of irresponsible ownership and of owner fail to live up to the standard that they should be adhere to sadly the power available to the english football league be not as great as they might be and hope that the bill which will hopefully come to parliament shortly will tackle this and set high bar for ownership it be interesting that mr yongge be not allow to buy hull city the premier league be able to intervene to avoid that the efl do not have the power at the time to stop he buy reading and that be an absolute tragedy for our fan the player and the club hope something can be do about it we have be hop for sale since last october the former member for bracknell and attend march in read town centre with several thousand fan last october and we manage accidentally to stop all traffic on local road the fan send strong message to mr yongge that he need to get on with sell the club find preferred bidder and work with they to move thing on so that new owner could invest in the club in the last year the situation have not be properly address he have be in discussion with rob couhig the former owner of wycombe wanderer but sadly that fall through few day ago it have be announce that new preferred bidder have come forward urge mr yongge to take all reasonable step to engage with the new preferred bidder quickly and to conclude sale so that we can move on take our wonderful club forward and get it back up to the premiership ideally though the championship will do for the moment urge he to get on with sell the club and to take action on behalf of the people of reading would like once again to show my appreciation for olympians and paralympians they do amazing work represent this country and be ambassador for sport across the world also thank local sportsman and woman and young people involve in sport finally once again call for quick sale of read fc call the liberal democrat spokesperson max wilkinson if

successful olympics and paralympics to unlock the talent of the next generation the next keely hodgkinson or hannah cockroft be out there whoever they be they need the support and access to facility so they can flourish on the subject of hannah cockroft surely nine gold medal be now enough for major athletic stadium to be name in her honour sport and physical activity can bring so much to our life it provide people with sense of community and purpose as well as boost both physical and mental health it be important that we note that today be world mental health day and the contribution that sport and physical activity can make to improve our nation mental health indeed engage more people in sport and physical activity must be at the heart of our country public health mission if we want utopian future in which the nhs thrive that may be meet by some people with sigh and an assumption that sport be not for they but we must think more broadly the traditional discussion focus on competitive elite sport and too often that be represent in people mind by image of elite sportsman and it be usually man on rugby or football field run into one another but there be so much more to sport and physical activity we must view this issue holistically the risk of not do so be stark almost one third of child and young people be inactive the healthy britain report state obesity be estimate to cost the uk economy year physical inactivity be associate with shocking one in six death in our country it be all too easy to look at this debate through negative lens prefer to look at the positive opportunity which be measure in the personal and societal gain that can be make unlock the power of sport and physical activity could boost the economy by up to billion year when healthcare saving and gdp growth be take into account it can close the equality gap in school accord to the youth sport trust of school say that participation in sport increase pupil achievement in school sport in prison can even help to cut crime and reoffende particular challenge for our nation at this time thank to the legacy of the previous government our nation can and must focus on the future of leisure centre swimming pool and other grassroots facility the liberal democrats call for the creation of new critical health infrastructure that would be the designation for sport and physical activity facility help we all particularly child and young people to access pitch pool and court in our area and thereby lower barrier to take part in sport and physical activity my hon

teddington in my constituency have be lie derelict for more than decade have be sell to successive developer who quite rightly be not able to develop the site it be an asset of community value the community be desperate to purchase that site so that we can bring it back into community sport use do my hon friend agree that we need change in the planning law to allow community to bid successfully for such site my hon friend make strong point that could be critical health infrastructure designate under our party proposal those pitch pool and court have traditionally be provide by local authority but the defunding of council over many year have leave many area struggle to maintain facility the run cost of swimming pool be high and the need be acute the previous government swimming pool support fund be start and in cheltenham we have benefit from some investment as result but more must be do in the case of athletic facility lack of funding in the sector have leave local athletic club crowdfunde to keep facility go be aware of the success enjoy by hereford and county athletic club in save their track however in my own constituency the prince of wales stadium be in dire need of repair to its track so that the cheltenham and county harriers can once again host meeting of the standard that they require urge everyone involve in that endeavour to come together and seek solution in partnership with any willing and able organisation without delay wide partnership work at local level be certainly require to support grassroots sport and pay tribute to the many trust charity and club that have step in to fill gap in provision leave by cut to local council budget in cheltenham however we have one really positive story to tell the feed cheltenham leisure card which be run in conjunction with food bank the cheltenham trust and the local council give anyone who subscribe to our local food bank free access to our leisure centre lower barrier to take part in sport and physical activity for those most in need as child and young man take inspiration from the sportspeople see in front of matthew le tissier whose politic remain his own alan shearer tim henman serena

at the dell watch matt le tissier and other but the majority of my consumption of sport be on free to air television today youngster simply do not have the same opportunity to be inspire urge the government to consider extend free to air coverage of international cricket rugby golf and tennis and even extend protection to some live premier league football coverage for both sporting and economic reason be it not time for london to have its own nfl franchise expand on the success of the london series of game at wembley and the tottenham hotspur stadium it could bring many hundred of million of pound to our economy every year and bring the joy of nfl to many more fan in this country sport instill in lifelong love of physical activity which be extremely grateful for my arthritic toe be perhaps less grateful however that love be most recently indulge during recess at cheltenham man fat football club the organiser jamie baron tell how the combination of goal on and off the pitch help he lose two and half stone the club player have lose combined kg in the past eight week help improve their physical and mental health be proud to join the egg fried whites team against side

opportunity to congratulate the sports minister the under secretary of state for culture media and sport the hon member for barnsley south stephanie peacock and the shadow sports minister my hon friend the member for old bexley and sidcup mr french on their role as former sports minister know that the role have upside but it also come with lot of hard work and graft the role often involve deal with the downside of sport regulation racism in cricket head injury in rugby financial distress and so on with sport governing body and come up with solution in challenge area such as trans where we be all try to ensure we get the right balance between accessibility and fairness and safety know how hard govern body work on that and know that will be challenging area for the minister there be some upside too know there be lot of noise at the moment around declaration and attend sporting event but as sports minister it be the hon lady duty and responsibility to get around the country and be champion for all sort of sport hope the noise around that do not stop she from do her job that be really important because not all sporting event be wimbledon the job be also about championing disability sport woman sport and low league sport around the country want to see she at those event every weekend she will not get criticism from for do any of that there be another downside to be sports minister on call with sports ministers from around the world they all introduce themselves as the former world champion of this and the former gold medallist of that then it come to the brit and it like ve get medal from sport day at my school back in slightly embarrassing the other downside be afraid be often be require to be in photo along with lot of very fit handsome and beautiful people which be slightly challenging or be invite to enter the ring to spar with world champion boxer would get ask minister would you like to participate in the metre final with journalist wait there with camera just to humiliate you no thank you very much but it be an amazing job and one that enjoy very much if you will allow madam deputy speaker would like to say huge thank you as have never have the opportunity to do so be appoint minister for sport and tourism in february it be the job have always want few week later however we be in lockdown and there be no sport and no tourism as

department we be able over time to get sport up and run again be really proud that we do because we all know how important it be to health and mental health and let we not forget that sport be major economic contributor to the uk it be massive export earner for the uk there be hundred of thousand of people involve in sport and support by sport plus it make we all feel good and unite we that bring to another point which the under secretary will find out about at some point in the future should she ever be unfortunate enough to be reshuffle into different role number of members would say to we use to like you when you be sports minister but not so much now because the role be not particularly party political be glad that that will be the tone of today debate we should not and can not take the amazing success of our olympians and paralympians for grant and we be all here to applaud they today they have put in an incredible amount of personal effort to achieve that success the united kingdom punch way above our weight in sport that be not an accident think all of we would applaud the work of john major for example on the initiative back in the to ensure that money go into sport which be often controversial through the national lottery that have continue ever since know how difficult it be to argue for money for sport but sport be so impactful on the health and mental health of the country what incredible success we see this year not only in the medal haul which be important but in the personal success story and personal best the medal be really good indicator of our global success in particular my of the paralympians they be second in the medal table again that speak volume of the united kingdom we champion people with disability we applaud they and literally put they on pedestal the paralympics be way to show what people with disability can do as oppose to focus all on the time on the thing they can not do the uk have fantastic global reputation in particular for disability sport thank everybody involve not only as say the govern body uk sport and sport england but the broadcaster who put the paralympics on tv at prime time the british public watch the game in their million that be not the case in many other country around the world the under secretary be probably be approach by other sport ministers from around the world say how do you do it you have incredible success how do you come second to china in the medal table and tv be one of the reason why as my hon friend the member for old bexley and sidcup say we be very successful back in we get just one gold medal we be the only country to have achieve gold medal in every single olympics in the modern era that be remarkable and funding be fundamental to that from because of co operation and take politic out of lot of it we have have broad consensus on back sport long may that continue would also like to take the opportunity many of we in the house be very proud of our constituent who participate in the olympics and paralympics this year to applaud olympic swimmer matt richards matt skelhon issy bailey rebecca redfern and matthew redfern on their incredible success know have meet they multiple time that they have very proud parent let we not take sport for grant we like to applaud our sportspeople for very good reason funding be majorly important express my huge gratitude and

shockingly be find dead on wednesday at the age of just he be fantastic footballer who play many time for greece and be involve in two promotion to the premier league his death will leave huge hole for all who support he and particularly of course for his friend and family it be great pleasure to speak in the debate and to reflect for while on the amazing success that we enjoy in the olympics say well do to everyone who represent great britain in both the olympics and the paralympics success in the olympics require preparation and have no doubt that our team be hugely inspire by our prime minister who remember to bring cagoule to the opening ceremony when none of the other world leader have think to do so that may have be the key moment that secure their subsequent success as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on tennis want to take this opportunity to bang the drum for tennis and to focus little on the future horizon at the elite level british tennis have see huge success in include its success at the paralympics alfie hewett and gordon reid win gold in the man double and complete the career golden slam have win all four of the grand slam event and now the paralympics alfie hewett also take home the wheelchair man single silver medal and andy lapthorne and greg slade win silver in the quad wheelchair double if there be prize for the most memorable non medal win moment of the olympics the remarkable comeback of andy murray and dan evans in the first round of the olympics tennis against japan prolong andy murray amazing career in the process would have be strong contender this year see andy lower the curtain on what have be fantastic playing career to win three grand slam and main tour event while share an era with the three great player ever to engage in the sport be tremendous achievement and think he will be remember as one of the great athlete in our country history this year also see come of age moment for jack draper who reach the us open semi final and katie boulter who win her first wta event in san diego and be now comfortably establish among the world top player there be exciting sign for the future with mika stojsavljevic win the us open girl single and mimi xu reach the girl top hannah klugman continue to establish herself at the top of the girl game and towards the end of the season remarkable run of challenger victory that take jacob fearnley into the world top male player away from the elite level tennis continue to buck the trend of fall participation that be see in many sport some million adult and million child play tennis every year and the strong growth in participation in recent year mean that tennis be the third big traditional sport in term of participation it be also one of the most gender equal sport with female represent of adult and of child who play every year while range of format include wheelchair learn disability visually impaired deaf para stand and walk tennis provide opportunity for people with range of impairment to take part in the sport there be grow evidence that nothing do more to boost longevity than play tennis accord to recent study of people in copenhagen those who play tennis live an average of year long than the overall average outperform badminton football cycling swimming and jog in that regard you will be glad to know madam deputy speaker that these opportunity to enjoy long and healthy life be also available to member of parliament the thriving appg on tennis give they an opportunity to play every week over the summer month here in parliament however it be important for opportunity to play tennis not to be deny to anyone because of where they live or how wealthy they be which be why the park project launch by the lawn tennis association in partnership with the government be so important it involve nationwide investment of more than million by the uk government and the lta tennis foundation to transform park tennis court across britain and open up the sport to many more people the lta aim be to bring back into use court across britain span local authority and to increase participation with further half million people play tennis in park annually and with more than of the site be transform in area of high social deprivation the new tennis court at king george park in staveley be one example of court previously in state of disrepair in deprived community that have be bring back into use and be delighted to join my hon friend the member for mid derbyshire jonathan davies who be then the lead on leisure in chesterfield borough council in give they their very first use last summer this programme facility be so transformational that it really need to be extend by this government and urge my hon friend the minister to work with the lta on ensure that it be extend in the upcoming budget expand access to tennis be key objective for the lta but it have always be my view that allow people across the country to watch top tennis player in action be key part of expand participation and must again express my disappointment that professional tennis in this country continue to happen largely in london and the south east the wimbledon championship be the world most iconic and well know tennis tournament bring in an estimate million annually and look forward to by player fan and sport reporter every year britain currently hold main tour man event at queen club in west london and in eastbourne and woman event at eastbourne nottingham and birmingham that have already mean that there be no man main tour event north of west london but now the lta have announce that the main pre wimbledon woman event will also be at queen club thus grade birmingham and nottingham it be true that the lta have hold gb davis cup week very successfully in manchester for the last two year but that be not replacement for main tour event among our competitor such concentration of event be unusual france hold man main tour event in montpellier marseille lyon and metz as well as in paris germany hold they in five city and the united states do so in the picture be similar when it come to woman event with the other major country play in many different city from onwards britain will hold only one event north of london for woman and none for man that be not acceptable while recognise that it may be more difficult to run event profitably away from london although the recent manchester davis cup sell out be the big crowd ever in britain for tennis match urge the government and the lta to sit down and find way to ensure that professional tennis be not see only in london and the south east the other big issue for tennis will be the finalising of plan for some lasting legacy from andy murray career andy mother judy have be battle for year to create new tennis centre near dunblane and it be hugely disappointing when owe to the many obstacle place in the way she recently announce that the plan be be shelve it be crucial that lasting legacy be create to mark andy amazing career and to ensure that the increase exposure that his success bring to the sport be not lose tennis be in good heart madam deputy speaker and it be good for your heart as well there be more to do to ensure that the sport be enjoy at all level throughout the country and hope that the government and my hon friend the minister will do their bit to keep it grow call vikki slade to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for call to make my maiden speech in this uplifting debate to celebrate the success of the olympics and paralympics congratulate the hon member for warrington south sarah hall completely agree with her sentiment about child who be beneath the radar and will do everything can to ensure that they be lift and see one of my happy family memory be of trip in to enjoy the spectacle and the spirit of the london paralympics in the pool and on the track day that surely inspire my own child passion for and dedication to sport my constituency can lay claim to britain first ever track and field olympic gold medallist charles bennett train driver from shapwick otherwise know as the shapwick express win the metre in and take two further medal but be largely forget until his family discover his achievement more than year later my own journey to this place have be more of marathon than sprint it take four

you should stand without her faith in would not be here and hope that can emulate her work such as her support for park home owner protect dorset heathland and fight for well education funding and that can achieve just fraction of the deep respect and admiration that our community still feel for she turn to my immediate predecessor michael tomlinson he be so proud of his legislative role first as government whip then as solicitor general and most recently as the minister for illegal immigration know that he take these responsibility very seriously but not as seriously as his love for cricket on recent trip to the netherlands he captain the lords and commons parliamentary cricket team against their parliamentary team my constituency of mid dorset and north poole be make up of dozen

coffee that party civil war be good for drastic weight loss and that you probably should not call other member of this house miserable pipsqueak he also teach that the house of commons can be an incredibly powerful agent for change and that sometimes you just have to be brave tom be fierce champion for west brom and he be never scared to stand up for those who need he if he have not encourage

school sport day and award to encourage child to dare to dream it be the reason we in this house need to play our part as be sure we all do to encourage sport by fund sport development particularly in northern ireland where parent of athlete such as rhys sacrifice ten of thousand of pound to see their son succeed the hon member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean refer to an athlete from his constituency who have no sponsorship for many year but still succeed that be what parent and family do we need to provide assistance and build on these medal so that we have generation of world class

brilliant summer of sport with team gb end the paris olympics and paralympics with more medal than ever in my sport of tennis which my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins speak about so eloquently british player do so well at the us open be so proud of our paralympic and olympic athlete they be role model and an inspiration to our young people also know though that each one of they will have be support by an encouraging grassroots club or organisation without such club accessible playing ground and court and referee and coach who encourage grassroots player to become professional athlete we would not have the incredible set of athlete of whom the country be so proud for that reason congratulate everyone who contribute to the success of our paralympic and olympic team the athlete coach friend family and official sport have incredible potential to open new door for young people and break down barrier to opportunity every child should have the chance to find sport that they enjoy to thrive and grow in confidence and to learn valuable teamworking skill it be essential that sport form key part of broad curriculum since the youth sport trust have find that the number of hour of pe teach in secondary school have fall by but sport be not just important for young people and professional athlete it be way for adult to keep healthy and to create friendship throughout their life by watch and participate in it that be why it be massive concern that the late active life survey find that activity be less common in old people woman and those with disability one third of adult in the uk do not meet the chief medical officer minimum requirement for physical activity level almost third of our child and young people be consider inactive mean that million child and young people do less than minute of activity each week sport england have find that child and young people from the least affluent family remain the least active and be fall far and far behind sport be form of social mobility it allow young people to build teamworking skill and relationship with people from all walk of life the government must ensure that child be able to access sport on the curriculum and in their local community that mean investment in our local sport facility more lighting for outdoor facility and the renovation of old leisure centre such as the one in atherstone in my constituency be delighted couple of week ago to put spade in the ground for the new physical activity hub in bedworth in my experience as player of county level tennis have see how the lta have ensure that variety of tennis option be available for people of all ability that include wheelchair tennis tennis for those with learn disability and visually impaired and deaf people and para stand and walk tennis those modification demonstrate how every sport can become more inclusive so long as we encourage organisation to have inclusivity as their priority as line judge and umpire at grassroots level and at wimbledon know all too well that we need committed volunteer at every level of sport from our junior and local event through to the high level of sport at international event there have be pathway of training and support for those give up their time and it be essential that we continue that yesterday be sad day to find out that line judge at wimbledon be be replace by machine hopefully my role in this house will not meet the same end it be an honour to follow my hon friend the member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor who know will be great champion for inclusive and community sport as retread this be not my maiden speech but it be my first opportunity to address the chamber in debate since my time away from this house allow to engage

work in this place to improve the life of her constituent wish to also pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of my two labour predecessor michael mccann and in particular adam ingram who serve my constituency for year have be fortunate enough to have have many source of inspiration and support throughout my career the very first of whom be the late great tessa jowell without her political tenacity vision and ability to bring people together we would never have deliver the olympic game which be the great sporting event this country have see in generation tessa recognise the power that sport can have in inspire and unite people community and country my constituency be home to thriving sporting sector both professional and grassroot include scotland only professional basketball team the caledonian gladiators and my personal favourite the claremont colts disability football team for young adult which provide dignity sense of belong and good old fashioned fun the unprecedented growth of woman football have bring great delight in recent year but surely the catalyst for that be gregory girl trailblaze film about woman football which star the east kilbride bear and breed actress dee hepburn east kilbride be believe to take its name from woman the patron saint of ireland brigid of kildare who be believe to have perform heal miracle there be nothing to suggest that brigid ever visit scotland but in east kilbride we can say that she visit we and we have pay she pretty good tribute through the town we have build east kilbride be scotland first new town build in the post war era to accommodate the overspill from glasgow offer an escape from dire overcrowding and squalid condition in glasgow infamous tenement east kilbride quickly become symbol of progress and place where work family could find not just home but community opportunity and future its modern architecture park and green space have make it model of post war urban planning east kilbride may have deliver new start for many glaswegians but folk there do not leave behind the city famous humanity and defiance of injustice when they quit those tenement one of the most powerful statement of solidarity that this country have ever see be make by group of engineer from east kilbride rolls royce factory ordinary people risk their livelihood to defy the chilean dictatorship in by refuse to repair the engine that have be use to destroy the country democratic government there be no violence no hatred just the power of work people stand together only few week ago one of the engineer who lead that action bob fulton die at the age of and take this opportunity to pay tribute to he and his legacy which will live on strathaven be also home to another scottish revolutionary james purlie wilson who be prominent figure in the radical movement seek electoral reform although east kilbride be home to of my constituent it only account for of its land mass the rural community of stonehouse glassford chapelton sandford and auldhouse all have distinctive feature and unique community spirit strathaven with its historic market town charm offer different yet equally essential contribution to the character of my constituency if kilbride be name with gaelic origin strathaven be even old with brythonic root today it exemplify the deep rooted sense of share history that that go through my constituency and scotland as whole it remind we that we must do all that we can to support our rural community to overcome the many challenge they also face during the election campaign when be out knock door on the doorstep of east kilbride and strathaven nobody ever ask for miracle that only st brigid could deliver it be not miracle that people seek it be just the basic public service that work job that pay safe and warm home and maybe even just enough cash at the end of the week to get takeaway those conversation have stay with since and will continue to be at the forefront of my mind while serve in this place other thing strike and be emphasise by the civil disorder that we see over the summer we share serious concern across the house about the rise of hate whether that be antisemitism islamophobia or misogyny which have infect far too much of our public discourse in recent year particularly on social medium intend to dedicate much of my time here to work cross party to address the alarming upsurge in racism and bigotry online particularly in my work as chair of the all party parliamentary group against antisemitism inspire by the rolls royce worker decade ago we can come together and say nae shall not pass to push back and defeat hate we must have hope but that hope must be real and base on realism rather than idealism or indeed miracle there be no contradiction between politic that be realistic and politics that be hopeful indeed we have all have enough too much false hope in the last few year believe in what the australian leader ben chifley call the shin city on hill but also believe that we need clear plan for how to get there and to be honest about how long it might take responsible and effective government do not undermine real hope in our community it underpin it so to the people and the community of east kilbride and strathaven say thank you once again for place your hope and trust in call danny beales to make his maiden speech it be privilege to follow such wonderful speech from right across the house and particularly from my hon friend the members for corby and east northamptonshire lee barron and for east kilbride and strathaven joani reid think that uxbridge and south ruislip be tongue twister but might have be slightly outdo by my hon friend want to say thank you to the people of uxbridge and south ruislip for their perseverance they have wait even long for labour mp than have wait to make my maiden speech remember meet one gentleman who tell that he return from war and vote for the first time on the navy ship back to south ruislip in he have vote labour then for the first time and at every single election since while he be delighted to see the labour government return and the great thing that they do unfortunately he never subsequently see labour mp in south ruislip until today it be always privilege and an honour to represent the community that we be bear in we grow up in and we live in and perhaps even more so when it initially seem like it might not happen as be sure colleague know six week feel like long campaign well trust two and half year of campaigning feel like lifetime but it do give the opportunity to speak to thousand of my constituent in every corner of my constituency pay tribute to my predecessor steve tuckwell who work incredibly hard in the month that he be our member of parliament in the spirit of focus on what unite we have to say that steve and have more in common than people might initially imagine we be both bear in hillingdon hospital and we attend local school we even live on the same street in south ruislip the street that my grandparent call home for many year one of the first question be often ask be whether share his love of fish and chip and will continue his infamous campaign for new chippy in uxbridge well must admit that that be one thing on which we differ slightly defer to he and his leadership of the fish and chip shop campaign although that campaign certainly create few headline uxbridge and south ruislip be no strange to news headline arguably it be one of the most canvassed and media interview constituency in the country at point it have be hard for my constituent to walk down uxbridge high street without journalist ask for their opinion about former prime minister or the late uk political drama be hop that the next four year will be just as busy but slightly less dramatic for my constituent than the previous four year although we do not share the same party affiliation it must be say that lord randall of uxbridge leave big shoe to fill as constituency mp and hope that can replicate his reputation for be hard work and dedicated constituency mp uxbridge and south ruislip be not define by any one issue or any one former political representative it be define instead by its rich heritage its hard work and aspirational community and its potential it be diverse place indeed the contribution of its diverse community be nothing new grow up remember the polish war memorial standing in south ruislip testament to the contribution that people come to our country have make throughout our history and continue to make today the memorial commemorate just some of the many service personnel who join the uk war effort to fight fascism and to defend the value of democracy and liberalism over the summer

achievement of our paralympians such as natasha baker the multiple medal win dressage champion from cowley and michael sharkey from hillingdon it be also important that we recognise that although

it be critical for this government work in partnership with sporting body to build on that success and help to transform the uk into the most physically active nation in europe this have be call for by the newly re form all party parliamentary group for sport brilliantly support by the sport and recreation alliance here pay tribute to my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater for her amazing chairship of the appg over many year and it be important for we to get behind that call we should not be start from point at which school sport for of our population have be decimate over the past year and nearly third of child and young people be now inactive we should not be start from point at which child and young people from the least affluent family remain the least active and be fall far behind or point at which more than third of adult be not meet the chief medical officer minimum requirement for physical activity with obesity and cardiovascular disease the inevitable result there be so many reason why become more active nation be vital for our country future we can reduce the burden on the nhs by cut spending on preventable disease by billion per year more important we can take up the challenge lay out by the secretary of state for health and social care by shift the focus from treat disease to prevent it move from be an increasingly unwell population to be healthy happy and more prosperous one as result in that we must categorically include mental health and the huge wellbeing benefit to individual from be fit and active calculate at billion per year but in reality priceless to the individual concern have serve in local government for many year lead public health programme to tackle health inequality can vouch for the power of sport and physical activity to reach those who public service sometimes find it hard to support and to promote attainment inclusion and above all good health to make those transformative step forward reality we need among other thing to protect public and national lottery funding for grassroots community sport recreation and physical activity so that the sector can continue to focus effort on drive up participation support its volunteer and reduce inequality we need to incentivise growth in participation by simplify and enhance tax arrangement for sport club gym pool and leisure centre we need new long term join up plan to give every child minute of sport and play day and we need to boost our workforce with locally lead skill development that align with education provision employee need local health and wellbeing and economic priority let we build on the amazing legacy of our elite sport team and the huge commitment of our grassroots sport infrastructure such as dartford football club dartford valley community

commitment to these grassroot sporting organisation to transform the uk into the fit active and healthy country that we can and need to become may say what an uplifting day it have be in the chamber we have hear so many personal and impassioned maiden speech and it have be pleasure to listen to they want to try to keep spirit high because believe that without doubt we live in the great elite sporting nation in the world the lionesses be the current euros champion in just the last few hour england cricketer have set the fourth high test score in year of our great game and be well on their way to historic victory in pakistan our olympians through the age range from steve redgrave to chris hoy and from jessica ennis hill to keely hodgkinson one of our own from welwyn hatfield be louise fiddes the metre breaststroke gold medallist in the classification at the paris paralympics just few month ago big part of an astonishing team gb success there be inspiration wherever we look but fear that success at the elite level be not translate into grassroots participation on the scale that we would all hope to see compare with our european neighbour we be an inactive nation almost third of child and young adult do less than minute of physical activity every week and it will come as no surprise to hear that family from low socioeconomic group be be leave behind in their physical education and development it be our job in this place to work with our community to champion active lifestyle and maximise the opportunity for all to get involve for the joy of sport but for the future of our public health too tragically physical inactivity be associate with one in six death and the health secretary be absolutely right to say that our nhs need to shift from treat sickness to prevention by become more active nation we can cut spending on preventable disease by billion every year if we get this right the prize be healthy and wealthy country sport have unique power to bring community together be very amateur cricketer and one of the joy of the game be be able to play against and alongside people from host of different background and live experience in the last couple of month that have even extend to play with conservative mp in the lords and common cricket club there be serious point here the sport and recreation alliance have find that of people believe that community sport club and group play crucial role in foster sense of community in their area small number of people in our country seek to drive wedge between community as we see this summer with the appalling scene of violence and disorder sport be part of the antidote means to bring together people from all walk of life in my constituency from birchwood playing field in hatfield to welwyn garden city cricket club in knightsfield will take every opportunity to champion sport and physical activity and hope to be small part of collective national effort sorry australia but we be the great elite

success add billion of pound to the uk economy bring whole community together and inspire those of we who will never compete at an elite level to participate in physical activity for the sake of our health and wellbeing local authority play key role in ensure that this continue they run leisure centre and swimming pool provide park and open space where people can exercise manage bowl green tennis court and football pitch and organise initiative whereby people can undertake physical activity to improve their health and tackle loneliness this be essential to reduce pressure on the nhs and to help people make healthy lifestyle choice and enjoy more year of good physical and mental health the leisure centre and sporting facility provide by council be also essential to ensure that young people of all background who have the potential to reach the high sporting level can hone their craft sport must not be just for those with the recourse to pay but must give opportunity for young people to begin their journey to be sporting hero for those of we who be look to participate in sport and fitness activity for our health that have be undermine by the draconian cut and rise cost face by local authority for more than decade as whole council have face real term cut to their core spending power since meanwhile the challenge the cost and the commitment they must make have rise significantly leisure centre and sporting facility be discretionary service council do not have legal responsibility to provide they and in the case of council have to constantly mitigate the risk of financial meltdown they have often be the first service to be reduce subject to increase charge for user or close all together this be an appalling situation that be store up problem for people health and wellbeing as well as for the future sporting prowess of our nation despite this many council be find way forward to protect their sport and leisure provision include amber valley borough council which go above and beyond to save belper leisure centre in my constituency from closure last year be pleased that the labour manifesto commit the new government to provide great stability to local authority by give they multi year funding settlement and end wasteful competitive bidding but also encourage ministers to work with the nhs integrate care partnership and integrate care board to

follow all the wonderful maiden speech today and to hear that share commitment to service and community it really be inspiring once again feel incredibly proud to be part of this intake be also very aware that when speak at the end of debate there be danger of repetition and apologise in advance for any that may happen however can manage one fresh statistic root and brook partnership of be the high ever in english cricket which be remarkable be so pleased to have this opportunity to speak in this debate and to congratulate and take pride in the wonderful achievement of our olympic team my sport be climb and so must especially congratulate toby roberts for his amazing gold in sport climbing it be brilliant competition and at the risk of pun grip to the very end it be just wonderful day for the sport back in the day when work at the british mountaineering council and for period oversee the competition programme we never imagine even the possibility of get climb into the olympics and it be amazing how far our sport have come it be not the only new olympic sport that be inspire new generation mountain biking bmx skateboard and even surf be now on summer programme and offer whole new set of opportunity for involvement in sporting life there really be now sport for everyone there can be no doubt about the power of inspiration provide by our great british athlete nor of the power of sport for good whether that be the positive impact it have on mental and physical health educational outcome social mobility crime and antisocial behaviour or just plain wellbee the evidence be comprehensive and undeniable indeed the excellent report healthy britain by my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater make the case and the solution crystal clear yet for so many young people the spark of inspiration once light be allow to go out all too easily although we enjoy the success of our gb athlete we must recognise that year of austerity have decimate local leisure service and sporting facility with the result that for all too many there be nowhere to go to pursue sporting dream or even just an active life although we rightly invest in athlete to provide inspiration and in exemplar facility for progression we too often forget those first step into an active sporting life and the facility and coach that enable it it be those very facility that have feel the full force of austerity as someone who have the leisure portfolio at my local authority for eight year have see the amazing work do by council and leisure trust to maintain any sort of leisure provision while be hit by cut after cut despite these good effort too many swimming pool and leisure centre have close of those that remain two third of facility include all those in my constituency of rossendale and darwen be past their lifespan and at risk of closure or reduced service play area be overgrown pitch be waterlogge and so on and so on the consequence be there for all to see despite our amazing medal success we remain relatively inactive nation we have hear these stat before but they bear repetition more than one third of adult do not meet the chief medical officer minimum requirement for physical activity and almost one third of child and young people be inactive mean that million adult and million child and young people do less than minute of activity week obesity be estimate to cost the uk economy billion year the british heart foundation estimate that the annual cost to the economy of cardiovascular disease be billion it be child and young people from the least affluent family who have be the hard hit they remain the least active and be fall far behind it be in our most deprived area where we see the most stark evidence of gap in provision and in participation pathway for child in these area horizon can be narrow to be meaningful and impactful facility must be truly local and truly accessible kick about area basketball court at the end of the road skatepark bouldering area pump track in park that people can walk or ride to bike library community centre offer indoor sport through the winter or simply be able to access the countryside that we see every day that to be the gap that we need to address if we be to complete the pathway from inspiration to sustained participation and perhaps excellence we need to recognise that the task be beyond the national lottery sport england or stress local authority budget we must connect departmental investment to the benefit that it bring the government have rightly prioritise prevention and reject sticking plaster solution one way that we can turn this intent into action be by properly invest via health policing social security and other budget in deliver the long term benefit that we know sport and active lifestyle can provide the evidence be clear the gap be clear and the opportunity be one that we must grasp must declare an interest will mention channel in my speech and be previously an employee of that organisation be really pleased to speak in today debate follow an incredibly exciting few month of sport from the football world cup to the wimbledon championship and the world cup whatever sport people be interested in this summer there be something for everyone of course community around the world turn their attention to paris for the olympic and paralympic game team gb give formidable performance win medal at the olympic game and paragb win massive medal at the paralympic game finish second overall in the medal table be delighted to cheer on croydon own thomas young in the metre sprint at the paralympics this year he give stellar performance and know that people across croydon will be look forward to cheer he on at los angeles there be number of benefit associate with sport broadcasting especially when it be available without financial barrier on our publicly own platform watch the incredible success of our olympic and paralympic great be inspiring particularly for our child and young people who might just find themselves new hero to look up to and new sport to try sport england emphasise the impact that engage in sport can have on young people include build positive experience improve physical literacy and offer they an environment where they can build confidence in safe space one of the barrier to engage in physical activity be access so be pleased that the government have commit not just to ensure that child and young people be be teach the require physical education curriculum but to support grassroots football club local community group and widen opportunity so that as many people as possible can get involve in physical activity pay tribute to one of the many grassroots organisation base in my constituency of croydon east an organisation that recently have the pleasure of visit the croydon harriers train at croydon arena alongside another wonderful grassroots club croydon fc they work to give young people and child sport opportunity such as training camp and after school club and they be part of the fabric of the local community however in britain today not all young people have access to such wonderful organisation for too many young people and adult with disability opportunity to get involve in sport can feel inaccessible sport england have find that those with disability be twice as likely to be inactive as those without disability and the charity activity alliance find that only of disabled child be regular participate in pe lesson those number be far too low but the high profile coverage of the paralympic game put out by channel be help to change perception of para sport bring new audience and increase participation channel report year on from the paralympics reveal that over two third of the uk population tune into the game and that of people say the channel meet the superhumans campaign open their eye to what disabled people can be capable of almost three quarter of viewer age between and say they be more comfortable talk about disability after channel coverage viewership of the game this year reach record high with million viewer across linear and streaming platform attract large proportion of young people than other channel that be the impact that public service broadcasting can have our paralympians be already brilliant and do amazing thing in their sport what they need be platform to inspire our nation sport can change life it can connect we and inspire we think speak for member across the house when say that we be so proud of team gb and paragb performance in this year game want to thank they for their contribution to our nation story for their incredible talent and for inspire nation it be great privilege to have listen to so many of my colleague maiden speech this afternoon include my hon friend the member for east kilbride and strathaven joani reid and my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales whose rightly very proud mum be in the chamber in today debate we have hear about the importance of sport in community across the uk and want to share with the house the truly inspirational achievement of my constituent kayleigh haggo paralympian from ayr kayleigh be six time world record holder in frame run and be prepare to win gold in paris this year when she be tell two year ago that her sport would not be include in the game in her own word it feel like her whole world crash around she but with true olympian spirit kayleigh spend the last two year become one of the good boccia player and be rank in the world she be select for team gb and make it all the way to the quarter final in paris this be truly inspirational feat we be all so very proud of what kayleigh have achieve by represent ayrshire in team gb try to contact kayleigh to suggest that she might want to watch this debate but it seem that she have more important thing go on it be her wedding day hope that the house will join in congratulate she on her achievement and on this very special day echo the comment of my hon friend the member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae about repetition when speak this late in debate be aware that be probably the only thing stand between hon member and train back to constituency so will try not to be long wind be grateful for this debate and to those who speak if oracy be an olympic sport many of our maiden speaker today would be medallist and as with most sport would be grateful just to take part across this house people be rightly proud of the achievement of our great british olympians be proud particularly of the consistency of our performance in the paralympics because it say something about who we be as nation refer not to government of either colour but to the spirit of the british people however it be important that we do not allow our celebration of british sporting success at an elite level to conceal the wide inequality of access to sport and physical activity one third of team gb medallist go to private school do not mean to disparage they only sheer hard work and perseverance could lead they to achieve what they do but when privately educate young people be four time more likely than child in the state sector to get an olympic medal we have to ask what be we do to ensure that all young people have the opportunity and support to participate and achieve in sport almost half the member school of the independent schools council have their own swimming pool have astroturf pitch and nearly offer row on their own lake and river meanwhile in the state sector school playing field be sell off between and as other have already note the department for education report that there be few hour of pe teach in the academic year compare with that have lead to situation in which few than half of child from less affluent background be meet the chief medical officer guideline of minute of physical activity day understand that there be pressure on public finance but mark my word any saving that we make now by fail to deliver improvement in school and community sport will cost we in the future through increase in childhood obesity and diabete which will add to future nhs bill we be head in the wrong direction the conservative and lib dem control durham county council it be under labour control until have cancel and delay upgrade to leisure facility the town of crook which have population of people lose its swimming bath over decade ago and several attempt since to bring they back have end only in disappointment it be not just young people who be affect remember vividly conversation have while canvass an old woman in her tell of her sorrow at the closure of the swimming bath and of have to take two bus an hour and half round trip to where live in bishop auckland for the near swimming pool that have mean that she no long go she be miss out not only on physical activity but on interaction with her friend she say it be the thing in the week that she have most look forward to sport be therefore not just about physical health but about loneliness and isolation in school it be also about the intrinsic curriculum be not bless with great physical co ordination but will always be grateful to my pe teacher mr brown who do not allow to use that or my asthma as an excuse he get on the run track tell to push myself and put in the school athletic team as many do learn through sport how to push myself how to strive for personal good how to play fair how to work as team and how to be magnanimous in the very occasional victory and frequently humble in defeat learn that sport bring people together and be great fun finally will focus on the mental health benefit of sport today be world mental health day recently meet manhealth group of man in my constituency who get together on thursday night perhaps in order to break down the stigma of mental health share my own experience of struggle with depression and anxiety include in the time since join this place which can often be hide with suit and smile one of the young man ask to see afterwards he have grow up in the care system and talk to about his struggle with anger temper management and in feel love and accept he feel acceptance and self esteem through play rugby and he be go to try out for team will not reveal which team for the sake of protect his identity be incredibly impressed by he and his candour several of my colleague have make excellent recommendation today that do not need repeat but appeal to colleague across the house not just to pay lip service on this my local authority have face cut of to its central government funding and the chief executive tell recently that we be in the territory of closing library and leisure centre so we can not just pay lip service there be no development without human development we should be strive to make britain the most active nation on earth over the next decade and end that decline before call the front benchers may pass on the congratulation of the whole house to the constituent of the hon member for central ayrshire alan gemmell kayleigh haggo on her wedding day it be probably an adequate excuse not to be watch the speech of her newly elect member of parliament with the leave of the house call louie french thank you madam deputy speaker it be my pleasure to

rightly celebrate the performance of our athlete and para athlete to return to my actual speech the paris olympic game see fantastic british athlete compete almost as many as there be new member in this place and medal win with deeply proud nation watch along there can be no doubt that the london olympic legacy be alive and well and continue to inspire the future of british sport the legacy that we have hear about today be make possible by record level of investment particularly from the national lottery and the conservative governments over this period investment that be make in the face of the olympic sized hole in the budget leave by the labour party in we have always be commit to our athlete and club from the grassroot to the olympics and we remain committed that be especially the case during the pandemic when our government invest an unparalleled billion of emergency funding through the department for digital culture media and sport support well over job and organisation even in some of the most difficult economic circumstance the conservative party have always back our athlete with the funding they need to compete at the high level that be why and the sporting industry more broadly remain disappointed that government ministers have yet to confirm the future funding for sport in our country since the election we have see an olympic game open and close we have see paralympic game open and close and we have see the government lose chief of staff in few than day perhaps not an olympic record but almost certainly british one our constituent and the athlete we have be celebrate today deserve an answer from the government about their future not next week not in month time but today as ministers will know british athlete need to know whether they be go to be fund during the next olympic cycle lead up to the los angeles game in and to what extent they need to know what equipment they can afford and when they can afford it equally importantly our world lead coach need to know whether the funding will be there to enable they to continue train british athlete over the next four year otherwise we risk competitor nation lure they away to emulate our world olympic and paralympic preparation nation around the world be already begin to copy our model of athlete development our football club need clarity on when labour will bring forward the football governance bill while horserace and the gambling industry be still in the dark over labour plan labour member repeat their confected line about the state of the economy almost as often as they draw breath but this government be create black hole of uncertainty at the heart of british sport we urge they to hold the line bite down on their shield and ensure that our athlete and uk sport have the support they need and the certainty they deserve want to start by say and originally write this down what collegiate and comradely debate this have be and until the shadow minister the hon member for old bexley and sidcup mr french stand up again it actually be be particularly impressed that my hon friend the member for leigh and atherton jo platt congratulate the secretary of state on wigan wanderers win over leigh leopards although she follow that by quickly point out that there be boxing club in her constituency think the former minister for sport the hon member for droitwich and evesham nigel huddleston give an excellent speech with lot of really good advice to the minister for sport the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my hon friend the member for barnsley south stephanie peacock and be sure she will take some of that on board he certainly make chuckle bit thank all those who contribute to this debate and be sorry if be not able to reference everybody individually but it really have be busy debate it have be pleasure to hear about and reflect on another wonderful summer of olympic and paralympic performance not only be such performance matter of pride for the country but they inspire nation know the minister and the shadow minister refer to he but it would be remiss of not to take advantage of be at the dispatch box to mention our alex yee mbe of brockley in my constituency of lewisham north who win the gold in the man triathlon and just think would share little story with everyone in area where we have placard say brockley they have now be rename brockyee and hon member can look online if they want to see they alex yee do we all proud as do all of the other olympians and paralympians include cindy ngamba she be in the gallery early whose achievement be so eloquently express by my hon friend the member for bolton north east kirith entwistle the government value sport that with the right support can and will contribute so much to how we deliver our priority mission should declare an interest in that as record in the register of members financial interests be fortunate enough to attend the paralympic game in paris and see our athlete in action in session of athletic cycling and swimming the obvious highlight be see brock whiston win the silver medal in the metre breaststroke and archie atkinson win silver in the metre individual pursuit be not able to see all the paralympians but as smart whip it would be wrong of not to mention gregg stevenson the good friend from his school year of my hon friend the member for bury south christian wakeford who win gold in the mixed double row and break world record do not know that he have train in the constituency of my hon friend the member for read central matt rodda or about the immense impact he have have on so many people perhaps my great reflection be that these athlete be at the top of their performance pathway there be so much that we as government can and will do to support all part of that pathway whether people be aim to take their first sporting step or to set world record the olympic and paralympic game be rare opportunity to demonstrate the sheer variety of sport in which to take those first sporting step there be whole world of sport and activity out there and one that we will ensure offer access and opportunity to as many individual as possible my hon friend the member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor passionately make the case for grassroots club and activity for all from the young to old people to be that pipeline but also for everyone physical and mental health the minister in open the debate speak of the opportunity for sport to contribute to the government mission she also say perhaps the shadow minister be not listen that we be commit to multi year funding we have not be in power very long so we be still get use to the different term and we be move at speed although perhaps not as quickly as the opposition would like the most obvious element of this potential be the health mission as small increase in physical activity can have such holistic health benefit that be eloquently put by my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins who passionately speak about both the cultural and health benefit of tennis with participant live on average year long yet sport can and do impact much more widely in society as well and it can be particularly influential in engage young people be personally hugely invest in how sport can contribute to safe community for they my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons rightly point out the need to invest in our young people there be some excellent example of how young people can be engage in sport and social activity with access to mentor and further opportunity provide wide positive message and they can be show alternative to violent influence will the minister join in recognise the contribution of community trust such as those at derby county and chesterfield football club in fill the gap leave by local authority who have suffer huge cut especially in regard to youth provision my hon friend make really important point if we be put club on the record may add my local football club of millwall whose community trust do excellent work in the local community it be important that young people be able to make informed choice away from crime and violence and towards future that need not lead they into the justice system but instead provide they with opportunity to thrive work across government that be our mission want to touch on the excellent maiden speech that we have hear today my hon friend the member for warrington south sarah hall give passionate speech champion her seat and former local woman leader and hope that her presence be present enough for her husband tom wish he happy birthday and be sure that he be extremely proud of she the hon member for mid dorset and north poole vikki slade speak about her beautiful constituency although think remember she call some part of it shitterton and happy bottom she do be rather nervous when my hon friend the member for west bromwich sarah coombes mention tom watson because once mention he while give speech at friends of labour students event and might have slightly regret it afterwards so think we should just stick with the son of toolmaker the hon member for north cornwall ben maguire use his maiden speech to campaign for cornish team at the commonwealth game and wish he luck with that my hon friend the member for mid cheshire andrew cooper speak about his constituency be an event capital make want an invite to join the banquet but be also very interested in the annual pina colada festival my hon friend the member for

member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales speak personally about his challenge grow up and how those make he want to make change in politic and be glad he have finally make it here in the final maiden speech today my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes pay the most fitting tribute to tobias ellwood who be the first to try to save the life of pc keith palmer to whom we all owe great debt of gratitude in finish this part of my speech will just say that know how nerve wrack it can be to do maiden speech you be all absolutely excellent sorry they be all absolutely excellent laughter see we can all make mistake at time be genuinely glad that they choose this debate to do so today we have hear about the importance of sport in its many form in the country the olympic and paralympic game may have pass but enjoy sporting performance of football and rugby be still part of the regular routine for many of we during the winter month the night may be close in but million be out there daily log their run play five side under newly fund floodlight or try new sport for the first time the government be focus on deliver against our five core mission and sport can do so much in many of these space it can be instrumental in break down barrier and create opportunity the sector can and will contribute to economic growth and sport and physical activity can and will improve the health of the nation serve by the nhs that be why will be work with my ministerial colleague to ensure that sport be key part of deliver across health and our other mission and to ensure that we can reflect on the continued success of our elite athlete for many year to come question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider sport and the performance of team gb and paralympicsgb in cost of rail fares motion make and question propose that this house do now wakeford wish to address the deeply concern issue of rise rail fare which be have profound impact on my constituent in woking and indeed on commuter across the country since the cost of season ticket from woking to waterloo have increase by it now stand at an astonishing when people be struggle with the cost of living crisis these eye watering fare rise be not only unfair but counterproductive if we be serious about promote economic growth and tackle climate change we must make public transport an affordable and attractive option for everyone instead rail travel have become luxury that many be find they can no long afford ironically risk debt to earn living that be not acceptable worse still these rise cost come alongside an increasingly unreliable service freedom of information request reveal that more than rush hour train be either partially or fully cancel last year that be rise on the year before and the bad record since uk passenger be be rail with terrible ask to pay more for deteriorate service that be just not something be willing to get on board with we need to get back on track and secure fair deal for passenger but this be not just about rail fare one of my new constituent joanna from west byfleet share her experience of the unsafe condition at west byfleet station car park where inadequate lighting and overgrown vegetation have create an isolated and unsafe environment at night despite multiple complaint to south western railway little have be do to improve the condition that be just one of many example where passenger be be let down and that be extra to the issue of cost want to highlight the plight of katie another woke constituent who have voice her frustration at the lack of fast train from woke that stop at clapham junction during peak hour after the am service there be gap of over minute without fast train stop at clapham key station on our network force commuter like katie to take long and more expensive route those be not isolate incident or example they be part of broad pattern of neglect that commuter across our community face now be the time for the government to act the liberal democrats and be call for an immediate freeze on rail fare which would save commuter in woking year and be sure that it would save commuter across the country similar sum that policy be not only affordable but necessary rail fare should not continue to rise while service decline do hon member see where be go with this we need long term reform the current ticketing system be fragment and confusing with passenger leave pay more for less we need simplified fair and affordable fare structure that work for everyone be aware of the government nationalisation plan and the bills before the house as well as the creation of great british rail but ultimately people be not interested in whether train be run by private company or public one my constituent want train that be affordable safe and reliable the conservative government failure to deliver on that have leave commuter in woking and beyond pay the price of tory chaos there be no conservative members in the chamber to argue with which show how little they care about the issue let we ensure that we do not repeat in this parliament the mistake that the conservatives make next year will be the anniversary of our railway we have real opportunity to freeze rail fare and make the year we give passenger fair deal rise there be number of member in the chamber this evening know that some have secure agreement from the hon member for woking mr forster to participate in the debate and that be perfectly in order but remind the house that the debate be time limited and expect that the minister will be give plenty of time to reply to any point raise it therefore may not be possible to accommodate everybody who wish to participate thank you madam deputy speaker commend my hon friend the member for woking mr forster for secure this important debate and thank both he and the minister for the opportunity to speak my hon friend eloquently articulate the cost and train service challenge face his constituent on the south west main line many of they be share by my constituent in didcot and wantage in their commuting experience on the great western main line between didcot and london paddington an annual season ticket on this route without any london travelcard addition for the mile in each direction cost peak hour day return be sadly few commuter can benefit from travel off peak in part that be because the evening peak period for fast train last from until nearly four hour such long peak period can create significant overcrowding on the first and last off peak train which be not an effective use of the capacity available give that we be frequently tell that travel volume be low than before the pandemic it feel like miss opportunity that such harsh rush hour restriction have not be reform to save money some of my constituent choose to double their journey time by use slow local train instead of intercity one which be less than convenient as well as support my hon friend call for fare freeze and wide service improvement make two broad observation first as so often with rail policy the key question for the government be how much do they wish our railway to be use and how much do they wish the railway to deliver their potential for wide economic value to make the most of the high and generally fix cost associate with infrastructure and operation make the ticketing system comprehensible and affordable will help to increase the volume of fare revenue as well as the yield from each fare secondly the fact that so many people in the east of england have long and expensive commute by train be surely partly product of london profoundly unaffordable housing market as so often transport policy do not or should not exist in vacuum resident in my constituency be fortunate that they can reach the capital in about minute however with paddington sit in the west of london weekday day tripper only get limited amount of time to spend in london if they want to enjoy off peak rate great western railway do run an afternoon service direct to newbury but the final train be at just five minute into peak time that mean that my constituent have to pay the extra peak time charge or wait three hour for off peak to kick back in my constituent elizabeth capewell have ask whether those with senior or disabled travel card could use the service which would make travel to london much easy and much more worthwhile hope that train operator and the government take that plea on board thank my hon friend the member for woking mr forster for bring we this debate and give we an opportunity to raise constituent concern and wide liberal democrat priority thank the minister for attend and give response to our point begin by raise the case as do this morning of the poor rail service to worcester park station which be affect my constituent quality of life they be unable to collect their child from school and they be miss family meal they be unable to rely on the train service and fear for their safety if they have to wait for taxi late at night when the train do not come want to broaden the discussion to investment in our rail infrastructure in early the previous government announce much vaunted funding for upgrade to the belmont rail line some million be award from the levelling up fund to dual track part of the line to allow train frequency to be increase to four an hour in each direction by the addition of pass loop at belmont station such an increase in accessibility would massively benefit my constituent but it be also key to get the good out of the cancer hub site that sutton council have be so ambitious in invest in that incredibly advanced world lead cancer research centre in south west london will benefit not just sutton and cheam but the whole of london do the minister agree that invest in these infrastructure upgrade as well as concentrate on get value for money from exist service be critical to allow resident to make sustainable transport choice do he also agree that it be critical to unleash the economic benefit of investment such as in the institute of cancer research in sutton and cheam to allow we to achieve our net zero climate goal and to boost the economy which the government seem keen to support thank my hon friend the member for woking mr forster for raise this important topic as the mp for guildford can speak for those of my constituent who commute and share in their pain on the daily commute from guildford every single week resident suffer terrible service on the train with delay and general problem it be no wonder then that constituent who commute to london and many other location across the south east and beyond feel incredibly frustrate by the fact that fee continue to rise while the service continue to deteriorate will the minister commit not just to hold train company to account more effectively but to ask they to freeze rail fare until their service improve in harpenden commuter face the absurd reality that single off peak ticket can cost but minute far on people can get an oyster fare at radlett for do my hon friend agree that this absurd and unfair pricing system need to be review agree and completely understand the ridiculousness of train fare across different area have incredibly high train fare for travel very small distance in my constituency which it be deeply frustrating commuter find the situation frustrating because they want to switch to train if we be serious about tackle the climate crisis and encourage people to switch their mode of transport to the railway we must address both reliability and train fare people look at the train service and say it be not convenient it be not reliable and it be expensive we must stop train fare rise because we need to encourage people to get out of their car and choose the sustainable transport method that be the railway congratulate the hon member for woking mr forster on secure this debate on rail fare and all member who have make contribution this evening for the past year our railway have be at the heart of our transport network during that time they have play an essential role in enable people to travel across our country visit their love one and seize economic opportunity this government be commit to get our railway back on track which be why we be already deliver major reform to fix our country break rail network in the context of challenging fiscal inheritance they include the passenger railway services public ownership bill which will potentially save taxpayer up to million every year in fee alone once all franchise be in public ownership reform and public ownership be essential to deliver further fare reform the current system be fragment with train operator that take no revenue risk make decision on aspect of fare and ticketing that be hamper the government ability to make the fare system fit for purpose public ownership will allow join up approach to be take across the network in macclesfield we have the pleasure of be serve by both avanti and northern train unfortunately the previous conservative government hand avanti yet another franchise despite its be one of the least reliable operator in the previous year do my hon friend agree that our plan for great british rail will not only improve reliability but ensure that rather than profit be repatriate to italy they be use for the public good here at home agree and can assure my hon friend that in the very first week when the secretary of state take office she summon number of company to her office to hold they to account they will be hold to account and we be determined to see improvement fare revenue be crucial to fund day to day railway operation as well as government priority to put passenger first and improve performance on the railway however recognise the serious concern that consumer have about the cost of rail fare the affordability of the railway be key objective for this government make sure that wherever possible price be keep at point that work for both passenger and taxpayer rise in rail fare can affect the family budget of work people include commuter between woking and london rail fare have always be an emotive subject and rise in fare be often contentious in that context it be vital that passenger know that they be get value for money that be why this government be commit to review the overly complicated fare system with view to simplify it the regulation surround the fare system be root in the privatisation of the so there will be many opportunity to modernise the fare system as we move towards establish great british railways and bring forward the legislation need to take on fare ticketing and other operational aspect of the railway however there be progress we can make now in improve fare and ticketing we be progress the expansion of simple easy and more flexible pay as you go ticket across the south east along with simplified ticketing pay as you go with contactless offer passenger good price guarantee on the day for most passenger it will always provide they with the good price for single day travel we be also consider how simplify long distance fare can unlock well value opportunity for passenger as well as smooth demand to make the good use of capacity while minimise crowd rail fare from my constituency of lewes to london have increase by since mean that if increase go ahead this year commuter from lewes will incur of cost for season ticket for many people whose salary have not increase in recent year while the cost of living have go up that be major cost we have see quite lot of success cap bus fare in recent year for some of our local user that have be an improvement will the minister support similar cap on rail fare thank the hon gentleman for his intervention affordability be one of our six key objective so that price wherever possible be keep at an affordable point that work for both passenger and taxpayer we be support lner to offer its simpler fares trial ticket between london and station around newcastle berwick upon tweed and edinburgh from september this year naturally we will evaluate carefully before take further decision lner have publish on its website the opportunity the trial offer include the new minute flex ticket between newcastle and london price at subject to availability the ticket offer degree of flexibility at nearly cheap than the old super off peak lner set out that overall around half of standard class minute flex ticket sell have be cheap than the old super off peak accord to its late figure in addition those and the vast majority of other ticket on lner be now sell on single leg basis where single cost approximately half the price of the previous return ticket rather than be price within pound of the return as be often the case that allow passenger to pay only for what they need by mix and match the right ticket for they for each leg of their journey for example advance ticket with flexible ticket or peak with off peak where those exist there be large range of railcard available to make rail travel more affordable for some with at least third off the cost of most rail ticket once establish would expect great british railways to take fresh look at the railcard suite so that we can encourage the high possible number of passenger to use our railway woking be part of south western railway critical corridor between woking and london waterloo and be therefore key to ensure strong operational performance south western railway record an overall satisfaction rating in the transport focus rail user survey in september this year many of my constituent commute into london for work and they complain that since the pandemic the number of train have halve they express their dread at the prospect of squeeze on to yet another train despite the reduction in service and the subsequent overcrowding price have increase resident tell that they pay extraordinary price for sub par service do the minister agree with that as principle order make the point early this week that intervention need to be short they be not mini speech they should be spontaneous and they should not be read out perhaps the hon lady have finish her comment thank the hon lady for her intervention if she would like to follow up with in write so that she can finish the rest of her point would be more than happy to pass it on south western railway also offer innovative product that let passenger choose ticket that suit their need such as the touch smartcard this allow ticket to be add to smartcard online via an app or from ticket machine at station in recent month there have be an issue with specific set of point at woking for which temporary fix have be find in the medium term more permanent solution will need to be seek which may cause the temporary closure of line for plan engineering for the commuter season ticket be still great way to save money on travel and be available on smartcard for two to three day week commuter the flexible season ticket offer further saving against traditional season ticket in woking flexible season ticket offer two and three day week commuter into london well value than both anytime day ticket and standard season ticket motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now wakeford we know that across the country people rely on train to get to work get to school and see their love one that be why we be relentlessly focus on secure improve service for passenger along with well value for money for taxpayer thank the hon member for woke for secure the debate be sure he appreciate that rail play an important part in people life across the country and especially in his constituency this government be put passenger at the heart of the railway and want to reassure member that we be work hard on put in place reform that will create strong more reliable railway that work for the people who use they question put and agree to house adjourn
