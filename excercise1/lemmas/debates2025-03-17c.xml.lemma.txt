cramlington and killingworth constituency what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in milton keynes what step she be take to support young people into employment education or training in derby with your permission mr speaker want to begin by say that there have understandably be lot of speculation about the government social security reform assure the house and most importantly the public that we will be come forward with our proposal imminently to ensure that there be trust and fairness in the social security system and that it be there for people who need it now and in the year to come almost million young people be not in education employment or training that be terrible for their living standard their future job prospect and their health that be why our new youth guarantee will ensure that every young person be earn or learn our trailblazer back by million of additional funding will lead the way and will start in eight area next month each of those million people be real person and be contact by young man in my constituency who study an early year education level and want to enter desperately understaffed profession but have be struggle ever since to access starter job be out of work while young can have scar effect that impact people job prospect for lifetime will the secretary of state work to identify people at risk of become neet and ensure that my constituent be support to find meaningful work thank my hon friend for her question her constituent deserve to fulfil his potential and live his hope and dream like everybody else we will be work hard with the department for education to identify those young people who be at risk of become neet to ensure that we put in place the skill train they need to get the job of the future and fulfil their potential as they deserve suspect there might be quite spike in the number of geordies not in work today give the cup final at the weekend recently visit azure charity in my constituency that provide learning and work opportunity especially for young people with learn disability and hear about the incredible work it do to provide young people with hand on experience in hospitality base learn environment will the secretary of state detail what more the government can do to support charity such as azure to provide these vital opportunity congratulate azure on its brilliant work believe that charity and voluntary organisation have an essential role in get people on the pathway to work and success know from the support internship programme that have be run in my constituency include through my local hospital that young people with learn difficulty can with the right support get those job and get that work that be what this government want to deliver be increasingly concern by the rise number of young people in milton keynes who be out of work due to mental health issue which think be key factor behind the nearly increase in young people claim unemployment benefit in milton keynes since can the secretary of state outline what step the government be take to ensure that these young people have the support and opportunity they need to continue to improve their health secure stable employment and live independently with well living standard share my hon friend concern about the number of young people not in work due to mental health condition which have increase by over in the last year alone the number of young people who be economically inactive due to poor mental health now stand at that be why we be focus on early intervention provide mental health support in every school and recruit an extra more mental health staff and from april we will be launch our youth guarantee and trailblazer to ensure that every young person be earn or learn the derby promise recognise that child and young people be the future of derby by bring together business and organisation across our great city to give child meaningful aspirational experience whether at iconic factory or cultural or sport venue we know however that child already face limit on their future career aspiration by the age of seven will the minister outline what work her department be undertake to support child in derby and across the uk from an early age to raise their future career aspiration will she also agree to visit derby to see the derby promise in action or one of my team will definitely visit the derby promise share my hon friend concern that young people be rule out future career at young age meet with the careers and enterprise company on friday and they tell that child be rule out career by their gender at age seven and by their class by age nine for the labour party that be not good enough hope the derby promise will be involve in the youth guarantee in the east midland lead by the mayor claire ward because we have to unlock the potential of every young person if they and this country be to succeed like young people in portsmouth north in cramlington and killingworth and in derby south young people in glastonbury and somerton face barrier to their employment education and training due to poor public transport infrastructure research have show however that improvement in public transport time could support reduction in employment deprivation what step be the minister take alongside cabinet colleague to remove barrier to employment education and training in rural area the hon lady make really important point and it be one that mayor and local leader raise with we regularly as well as family who be struggle and child and young people in poverty that be why we believe it be so important to put mayor and local leader in the drive seat of change so that they can link up transport skill and job opportunity as part of our plan my hon friend the minister for employment and have be work closely with local leader to ensure that happen because if people have to get work the transport must be in place the minister for social security and disability be kind enough to come to the launch of the what come after education report by national star and the together trust one key finding of that report be that young people with disability face particular problem when try to access work the system be set up against they and workplace be set up not to work for they yet many of they want to do whatever they can to find meaningful employment when minister be make decision about upcoming welfare change hope that report will be on their desk and that it will be properly consider absolutely and the hon gentleman will indeed be hear more about our plan which will include proper employment support to help people on pathway to success we also have our keep britain working review lead by the former boss of john lewis charlie mayfield which be look precisely at what more employer can do with support from government to create healthy more inclusive workplace and to guarantee that disabled people who can work have the same right and choice to work as everybody else much like the constituency that have be mention my young people in chichester be struggle to find work and that be no more apparent than for those with learn difficulty so will the secretary of state join in congratulate together our community or toc which provide work experience for young people with learn disability age to to show that they do have something to offer the workforce toc be about to open its own café and centre for these young people will the secretary of state outline what support be available for such charity and join at its opening next month join the hon lady in congratulate toc it sound like it be do fantastic work on friday be talk to the headteacher of special need school near my constituency who be say we absolutely have to ensure that work experience career advice and work with voluntary group be all part of the package of support we put in place if possible or one of my colleague will certainly come and see the work that toc be do because charity and voluntary group be absolutely critical to this government plan call the shadow secretary of state back in the autumn the right hon lady say we will not allow young people not to be in education employment or training how be it possible then that since labour have be in office there be more young people in exactly that situation the hon lady have year to solve the problem and the conservatives record be clear nearly million young people not in education employment or training which be one in eight of all our young people and the number of young people with mental health concern who be out of work have now reach that be the legacy of year of conservative government and it be legacy that this government be determined to change ask about what have happen since the right hon lady party have be in government it be her chancellor tax on job and economic mismanagement that be cost young people opportunity instead of tax job labour should have be ready with plan for welfare reform at the time of the budget they have spend nine month try to cobble one together and still we wait why do the right hon lady not make any plan in opposition and do she regret that conservative members have no plan even their own former chancellor admit that the number be make up the only thing they put forward be proposal on the work capability assessment which have recently be rule illegal by the court they have no plan but they have clear record leave people behind write they off and put they on the scrapheap this labour government will turn that around and get people and our country on the pathway to success two child benefit cap what assessment her department have make of the potential merit of remove the two child benefit cap the two child benefit cap be introduce by the conservative party year ago its period in office see child poverty rise to over million and one in three of our child arrive at primary school not ready to learn as soon as the secretary of state and be appoint we get to work to establish our child poverty taskforce as promise in labour manifesto and those effort be ongoing bmj study find that people in food poverty have diet with bad health outcome include more fat sugar and salt so what conversation have the minister have with the health secretary about how lift the two child benefit cap could improve diet and reduce cost for the nhs the health secretary and talk about child poverty many time as we sit on the opposition benches watch the situation for our kid get bad and bad every year the member make very serious and important point about the wide range consequence of poverty and if may would encourage he to submit the evidence he mention to the child poverty taskforce so that we can take full account of it one in two child in my constituency live in poverty there be lot of speculation swirl around the excellent child poverty taskforce which applaud the government for establish include that the cap could be lift for under five which would affect few than household compare with the household which currently be affect by the two child benefit cap can the minister reassure the house and the country that the child poverty taskforce be look to support all child in poverty whatever decision it come up with and not just small segment of they yes can all child matter we be take account of considerable range of different policy option carefully work through the impact that they would have but all the child in this country matter employment rights bill employment rates whether she have have discussion with the secretary of state for business and trade on the potential impact of the employment rights bill on employment rate meet regularly with business and trade ministers we be commit to work with business to ensure that policy be pro employer and pro worker boost wage will increase workforce participation help employer fill vacancy and support we to reach our ambition of employment with many labour members claim that they care about young people be employ have the minister department make assessment about the employment impact of the decision to introduce minimum guarantee hour for student and young people who rely on the flexibility of be able to pick and choose their work hour particularly those who be work in the hospitality sector which be be decimate by this government think the hon gentleman be refer to the ban on exploitative zero hour contract but if somebody want flexible hour contract then that be good thing and nothing in the change prevent that in fact since have be at the dwp have find that employer have not have sufficient contact from jobcentre and only one in six employer think about use they when get young people proper range of choice and job through the jobcentre not nearly enough work have be do to serve employer well that be what real growth agenda look like from dwp lá fhéile pádraig sona duit happy st patrick day to you mr speaker and all your team the disability employment gap stand at and countless disabled worker end up out of work because their employer refuse to make simple change that would help they to do their job do the minister agree that the default right to flexible working in labour employment rights bill will help many disabled worker to keep the job they love what else can the minister department do to help more disabled people to find and keep work may first say how great it be to hear the beautiful language of irish speak in this chamber with the increase in condition that can be variable over time the flexible working right will help people the minister for social security and disability and be work closely with disabled people organisation charity and other to think about how we can build those pathway into work as we change jobcentre and improve employment support ensure that raise disability employment rate be at the heart of those change benefit reforms disabled people what step she plan to take to ensure that disabled people be adequately financially support in her plan reform to benefit entitlement what step she be take through the benefit system to support disabled people we will be reform the current break system of health and disability benefit we will bring forward green paper with proper plan very soon set out how we will help disabled people who can work to do so while fully support the most severely disabled as well work be good for we it be good for our physical and mental health and for our general wellbeing when someone can work it be essential that they be give all the support to do so that say it be also imperative that those who be sick vulnerable or disabled be always protect do the minister agree that strike the balance between support those who can work and protect those who can not work must be central to any welfare reform my hon friend be absolutely right that balance will be at the heart of the green paper that we be bring forward we will deliver proper employment support for disabled people which have be take away since we will deal with the incentive to inactivity that the current system present of course there will always be people who be unable to work through disability or ill health and we be committed to fully support they too my constituent in eastleigh who support and help to care for disabled family member be desperately concerned about any potential cut to benefit include personal independent payment they include laura whose son be register blind and debbie who help to care for her disabled daughter and be herself disabled can the minister reassure my constituent that disability benefit for people who be unable to work will not be cut be concern about the level of anxiety and speculation that have be around over recent week be sad that that have happen and that people have be concern but the current welfare system be fail the very people it be suppose to help the people it be there for our aim be to make the system sustainable so that it will be there for people now and in the future when the hon lady see the proposal think she will see how we will deliver on that commitment call the chair of the work and pensions committee can my right hon friend confirm that there will be an analysis alongside the green paper on the impact it will have on poverty employment and health can confirm to my hon friend that we will produce full impact assessment in due course when be minister in the department for work and pensions work with my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on reduce welfare dependency get more people into work each and every day and deliver record number of people into work the labour party oppose we every step of the way can take it that the government recent conversion to reduce the benefit bill be only about con the office for budget responsibility into think that they will balance the book after their disastrous budget rather than because they really believe in it remember extremely well when the right hon lady be minister in the department it be very striking how the disability employment gap which have be fall up until suddenly stop fall and plateaue from that moment on we will deliver decisive shift to early intervention help people to stay in work and renew fairness and trust in the system we will provide personalised support so that those who can work can get the job that they want employment incentive what assessment she have make of the adequacy of incentive to seek employment the introduction of universal credit and the policy choice of the last conservative government seem to have have some effect on people propensity to be in work in january the department for work and pensions publish datum show that of the increase in the incapacity benefit caseload since the universal credit roll out of the rise in claim could be explain by foreseeable demographic change and the effect of the structural alteration to the benefit that leave of the increase that we do not have datum to explain but the office for budget responsibility and other have draw attention to the structure of social security and the change over the past decade on publish the analysis just mention tell the house that the previous conservative government take decision on social security that segregate people away from work and forget about they official report january vol stand by those comment the people of spelthorne be very hard work and do not mind their taxis be pay for safety net for the most vulnerable in our society but they really do get annoy when they see their taxis go to people who be scamme the benefit system what assessment have any of the ministers on the front bench make of so call sickfluencer site social medium platform where people be show how to game the benefit system have any of they look at those site be they good or bad thing the hon gentleman will know that the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill be go through the house at the moment the issue that he have raise be at the forefront of the attention of the minister for transformation my hon friend the member for stretford and urmston andrew western who will take every step he can to deal with issue in that area on friday visit stansted airport huge employer for my constituency and find out about the important work it be do with the dwp and the jobcentre to get long term unemployed people back into work what work be the department do with organisation such as stansted airport to promote good practice such as that at stanste and working minds in my constituency through my hon friend give my thank to everybody at harlow jobcentre because it sound like they have their shoulder to the wheel in get job opportunity for people who need they when we arrive in the department we uncover that there be not nearly good enough relationship between the department and employer that be why we put new strategy in place to do the basic well there be single point of contact and we be make sure that there be on the job training that be tailor to specific employer we will be do more to promote change in that area but thank everyone in harlow for the effort they be make call the liberal democrat spokesperson there continue to be unacceptable delay in process access to work application both for my constituent in torbay and across the country this lead to fear among disabled people that job offer will be withdraw by their would be employer what reassurance can the minister give the chamber that the government have plan afoot to tackle that backlog the hon member make an important point we have manifesto commitment to try to tackle the backlog we have put more staff in place to deal with that backlog but we have more to do because it be important that disabled people be able to take up job that be offer to they we need to make sure that that be scheme that work pension credit uptake what step her department be take to help increase uptake of pension credit this government have be run the big ever pension credit take up campaign in the late stage we be now write to all pensioner who make new housing benefit claim and who appear to be entitle to pension credit directly target they and encourage they to apply the rate of take up for pension credit have traditionally be between and if that rate be uplifted it could take people out of income poverty in dorset the number of have increase by about over the past decade people say that their big concern be the paperwork they have to complete the application contain up to question purely for pension credit and many pensioner would easily be able to claim for thing like the carer addition through slight tweak in the paperwork what be the department do to simplify and combine those application to make life easy for pensioner we be already do lot to simplify the process it now take minute on average to complete an online form and of people apply online or over the phone however the hon lady be completely right to highlight the fact that we must do more include by simplify the form we continue to keep that under review and be always interested in idea about how we can go far call the shadow minister when the government scrap universal entitlement to the winter fuel payment they say that all people eligible for it would get it through pension credit we now know that that do not happen they have get few than new pensioner enrol more than three quarter of million of the poor pensioner have miss out on vital support this winter so will the minister tell we whether that be the plan all along to save money at the expense of the poor pensioner or will he admit that he have completely fail in his duty towards the poor elderly people in our society the lesson have learn be from the last government who put up pensioner poverty year after year it increase by over the course of the last government this government have run pension credit take up campaign that have see an increase in application since july compare with the same period last year and more award compare with that period that be what government do their job look like that be more award than in the same period last year but people be eligible that be pathetic achievement and the government have spend million of pound on advertise this we still have thousand of people wait for their winter fuel payment and the winter be over so it be little late for the government next advertising plan the fact be that we still do not know who have miss out what the wait time for those payment be and what the effect have be on pensioner poverty or on hospital admission which have increase significantly for pensioner give the scandalous failure of their pension credit campaign will the government release all available datum on the impact of the winter fuel payment cut we have already release significant datum on that and as say datum be release just week ago show the unparalleled success of the campaign to drive up pension credit take up now we be concentrate on increase support for pensioner right across the board because the big disgrace of the last government be where they leave the health service that our old generation rely on we be turn that around day after day jobcentre impact on economic growth what assessment she have make of the potential impact of jobcentre on economic growth support everyone to find good meaningful work and help they to progress be vital for economic growth that include disabled people who want to work and contribute but who be let down by the current system jobcentre have key role to play in that and through create new job and career service we will help more people get into work and get on at work support our ambition for an employment rate be fortunate in my community that we have an above average number of to year old but when be talk to the manager of the hatfield jobcentre just last week they say that the single big barrier to young people get into work be their mental health which number of colleague have speak about in the chamber today can the minister say little more about our objective of help young people into work do he agree that the only way we will succeed in grow the economy be by help those people overcome the barrier with their mental health my hon friend be correct to highlight the importance of tackle economic inactivity in order to drive up economic growth this government understand the negative effect that unemployment can have on mental health particularly among young people which can impact future prospect the youth guarantee will help address barrier face by young people to ensure that they can access quality training opportunity and apprenticeship or help to find work boost their confidence and give they the very good chance of success in the workplace few week ago visit salisbury jobcentre and meet kirstie reakes and george thornley who be help organise job fair on thursday may they could not have be more helpful their encyclopaedic knowledge of the local job market and business be impressive will the minister congratulate they and thank they for the help they be give with the job fair in salisbury guildhall on may will he also reflect on what incentive jobcentre could have to reach out to business and deepen their knowledge of local labour market the right hon gentleman be correct to raise the issue of jobcentre reach out to local employer we know that we have significant issue with whether the jobcentre be the vehicle of choice to advertise local job opportunity that be long stand issue that we be keen to address be delighted to congratulate his local jobcentre on the work it be do to promote the job fair unemployment trends what assessment she have make of recent trend in level of unemployment official unemployment currently sit at which be clearly much low than the historic high of in june however today official unemployment level mask the legacy of the conservatives recent period in office which see the number of people off sick rise to nearly million concentrate in place with employment rate well below the national average create vicious circle where people be force to leave the place they love for the chance of career and where those who be leave do bad and bad that be why as part of our get britain work reform we be build new job and career service that will be locally tailor and will help everyone find access to support to get good meaningful job and to progress in work compare with this time last year almost more people be on the claimant count in basildon and billericay almost of those be under how many more will have to be make unemployed before labour ministers listen to charity gps supermarket manufacturer and care provider they visit in my constituency and say that labour need to think again about its catastrophic national insurance rise which before it even hit in april be already cost the job of my constituent we have significant reform plan to make sure that we tailor jobcentre support towards the need of employer because there be still significant number of vacancy out there that young people should be make the most of to start their career and progress in life that be why we have new employer strategy so that the department for work and pensions can serve business properly disabled people often face additional barrier when try to get back into work do the minister acknowledge that rather than freeze or cut their benefit we will need to invest in those people to help they back into work and to sustain they there yes do agree we see potential in every single person in the country and many of those who have be write off and leave on the scrapheap deserve much well pathway back into work welfare fraud serious and organised crime what step she be take with cabinet colleague to tackle fraud in the welfare system by serious and organised criminal gang the department work collaboratively with other departments and with law enforcement agency on investigation of benefit fraud carry out by organise criminal gang new power in the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill which be mention early by the minister for employment will strengthen our ability to tackle organise crime by modernise and enhance our investigation power grant dwp official power of search and seizure and ensure that those who defraud the public sector face appropriate consequence welcome the new power in the fraud bill and note the huge increase in pension credit fraud in recent year can the minister explain how capital fraud and fraud in which recipient stay out of the country for long than the rule require which together account for of all pension credit fraud will be target under the new rule my hon friend be right to raise this issue the eligibility verification measure in the new bill will do just that provide crucial data feed to help we identify fraud that relate to pension credit as well as to universal credit and employment and support allowance this will flag up claimant who be potentially in breach of eligibility under capital and abroad criterion so that we can start to lower the unacceptable level of fraud and protect the public purse pensions triple lock north durham what assessment she have make of the impact of the pension triple lock on pensioner in north durham constituency our commitment to the triple lock throughout this parliament mean that spending on the state pension be set to rise by billion year individual be set to see increase of up to year benefit pensioner in north durham and million people in britain as whole welcome the fact that the government be not only protect the triple lock for every pensioner in the country but tackle the big problem for pensioner by uprating pension credit by more than the rate of inflation encourage high take up of pension credit and substantially increase funding for our nhs can the minister tell how many pensioner in north durham currently claim pension credit and how many be entitle to it but do not claim it and could benefit from this increase my hon friend be right to draw attention to the importance of the increase in pension credit that will take place in just few week time and can tell he that about people be claim pension credit in north durham he be also right to mention the more than billion that the government be invest in the nhs the unacceptable state of the health service be the big betrayal of old generation by the conservative party and we be go to change that unemployment stoke on trent what step her department be take to help reduce level of unemployment in stoke on trent in the year to september of working age people be unemployed in stoke on trent but as say early that often mask big problem relate to economic inactivity frequently cause by ill health we propose to join up work health and skill support and to ensure that local area throughout england have get britain work plan so that every part of the country have plan to grow it be clear that the government be make serious attempt to remove the barrier prevent people with mental health condition from enter work may issue an invitation to the minister and commend to she the work of the combine healthcare trust in stoke on trent and its peer support mentor these be people who have overcome mental health challenge and now work with other people struggle with their own mental health to build confidence and opportunity whatever plan the government introduce work of this kind should be central to it and think that if they come to see it they would be very impressed would love to come to there be so many football relate joke that could make at this point but will not trouble the house would love to come to stoke and not just on wet tuesday night my hon friend make the case for exactly the strategy that underpin our reform which be to join up health and work support have see in my own constituency the power of peer mentor for mental health condition and would love to come and see the brilliant work that my hon friend have describe support disabled people into work what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the welfare system in support disabled people into work many disabled people want to work but be write off and fail by the last government our work aspiration survey of health and disability claimant find that third want to work at some point in the future if their health improve or the right job be available and say that they would work now if they get the right support this government will ensure that disabled people who can work have the same right and chance to work as everybody else because that principle of equality be what this labour government be for christopher resident of talke in my constituency be badly let down by flawed pip assessment one that lack basic humanity and empathy with report of welfare reform in the medium he be now deeply worried about what the future hold what step will be take to ensure that people like christopher be treat with fairness and dignity and give the support that they need say to my hon friend and his constituent that treat people with dignity and respect be absolutely at the heart of this government plan have be constituency mp for long year under the conservatives know that there will always be people who can not work because of the severity of their disability or illness but also meet day in day out disabled people who be deny the chance to work for many different reason that be what we want to put right to ensure that the social security system be there for those who need it and not just now but for year to come as the secretary of state look at reform be she consider the pip reassessment process for people whose condition will not get any well would it not be sensible to relieve they of the burden of that reassessment process unless they wish to be reassess that would be less distressing for they it would save money in the system and it would allow people who do need reassessment to be reassess fast agree with lot of what the right hon gentleman say patience be never my great virtue but ask he and the house to be patient and to look at the full proposal which we will put forward imminently support care leavers into employment what step her department be take to support care leaver into employment the department support care leaver aged to through an extensive range of intervention to help they into employment for example care leaver who start an apprenticeship be signpost to bursary from their training provider and they can still receive universal credit if they be on low income more broadly under the new youth guarantee all young people age to in england include care leaver will have access to support to enter employment education or training opportunity some of care experience young people be not in education employment or training three time the average rate and that be cost the uk over million year in lose tax revenue alone we can not achieve the ambition of get britain work unless we unlock the potential of this amazing group of young people do ministers agree that we need to take bold imaginative action to radically improve the number go into work my hon friend be absolutely correct to highlight those statistic the number of care leaver not in education employment or training be absolutely unacceptable and he will be stun to hear that be in full agreement with he topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility this week be sign language week and my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability will be speak in the backbench business debate to mark sign language week on thursday this week be also neurodiversity celebration week neurodivergent people face particular barrier to employment with less than one in three in work everyone deserve the chance to fulfil their potential so we recently launch new independent panel to advise we on these issue the expert on the panel include neurodivergent people themselves will present their recommendation to we later this year and very much look forward to their finding last week visit the crumbs project in my constituency crumbs provide training for people with disability and mental health condition to get the professional skill they need to go into the hospitality industry and the personal skill they need to live independently and of its trainee move into employment give the secretary of state commitment to bring people with long term health condition and disability back into work what more support can she give to successful programme such as crumbs welcome the work that crumbs be do in my hon friend constituency want to ensure not only that we overhaul our jobcentre have new youth guarantee and join up work health and skill support through our get britain working plan but crucially that our jobcentre and other work closely with organisation such as crumbs because only by work together will we get the right support to help people on the pathway to work and to success call the shadow secretary of state we hear yesterday that the cabinet have not yet see the welfare plan that the right hon lady be apparently due to announce tomorrow give all the medium briefing the apprehension of disabled people and the grow number of people not work none of we would want to see that delay can she assure we that she have get collective agreement so that she can announce her plan here in this chamber tomorrow the hon lady will have to show little patience she talk about plan but we have see she and the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon mel stride make claim in various newspaper about their plan but there never be plan the former chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt actually admit that during the election when he say that the number have already be score the only thing that the previous government ever put forward be rule illegal by the court they have year to put this right this government will act listen hard to the right hon lady answer but give everything hear still do not think she have the support of cabinet colleague with less than hour to go it be no there be never good time for million of people to be out of work but as the world get more dangerous we can afford neither the benefit bill nor the waste of human potential give the opposition of the right hon lady party to welfare reform can she assure that her plan reform will grasp the nettle and bring the benefit bill down that from member of government who leave one in working age people on sickness and disability benefit one in eight young people not in education employment or training and million people out of work due to long term sickness that be terrible for they for their life chance income and health and terrible for taxpayer who be pay for an ever spiral bill for the cost of failure unlike the conservative government who write people off and then blame they to get cheap headline we will take decisive action get people into work and get this country on pathway to success the number of young people not in education training or work be disproportionately high in area such as hartlepool something the conservative party do nothing about in year how will the secretary of state ensure that opportunity for young people reach every part of our country we will never get this country grow again unless we provide good job hope and opportunity in every part of the country include my hon

and the department for make that happen as well as citizens advice in stroud and bureaux throughout the country however there be people who earn just above that limit and live in poverty wonder whether when fiscal situation arise the government will review the cap and indeed the gradient of this benefit my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight both the progress that have be make and the hard work of the voluntary sector include citizen advice bureaux across the country we must continue recent progress and we shall certainly do so would like to highlight that our support for

business be start to ask employee to go self employ as they can not otherwise keep role open because of forthcoming national insurance contribution rise and extra employment law will the department watch out for this trend in its datum in case it be not the government intention to make worker less secure with these new taxis and more regulation since we take office we have publish research report datum and other bit of information that the department for work and pensions have previously be sit on the hon lady can rest assure that we monitor employment trend and be keen to ensure that the dwp be far more transparent about datum than it have be my constituent heidi recently move off benefit and back into work only to find she be earn less than when she be on benefit meanwhile my constituent tyrone be blind autistic and have cerebral palsy and although he be an aspire dj may struggle to find permanent work what step be the minister take to ensure that we take balanced approach support those who can not work with protection dignity and security while ensure that those who can go back into work my hon friend set out exactly the balance that we need to strike with our plan proper employment support on the one hand which have not be available in the past and deal with work disincentive in the current system on the other when he see the proposal shortly think he will welcome the measure we be plan can the minister reassure people who have have an amputation or have schizophrenia terminal cancer or uncontrolled epilepsy that tomorrow announcement will not mean cut in their social security as we have already make clear today we be absolutely determined to protect those who need to be protect in the proposal we be bring forward think the hon lady will welcome and

how be the minister work to address this issue with the ministry of justice to help family to gain quick and easy access to these fund will he give further consideration to increase the scope of the dwp appointee scheme to cover child tax fund and junior individual saving account up to welcome my hon friend interest in this subject which she and have meet to discuss she be absolutely right there should be no barrier to young people and their family access these fund the ministry of justice have make some progress already do not think the answer will be alter the dwp appointee scheme but there will be further progress to make thing easy what be the minister estimate for the number of pensioner who would qualify for pension credit but have not apply in north durham thank the right hon gentleman for his question the department for work and pensions do not produce datum at constituency level but will tell he the answer to his question at national level much low than it be before this government come into office support people back into work be not only the right thing to do for the uk economy but the fair and compassionate thing to do for people stick in the welfare system however over the past few day significant number of people have contact my constituency office with profound concern about what they have hear and read in the press do the minister agree that by remove the culture of fear and create nurture environment we can help people back into work and give they the support they need not just to survive but to thrive my hon friend be absolutely right we be determined to provide proper support which exist in the past but disappear after we want to provide that support again because so many people would thrive if they have it at the moment there be people out of work on health and disability ground who would love to be in job if they just have the support we will provide it for week the government active trailing of welfare cut have generate genuine fear disabled people in brighton pavilion be write to in terror will the secretary of state apologise for this and reassure the public that benefit change will not take place this calendar year or without parliamentary vote in this house first recognise that there have be good deal of anxiety and regret that but there will not be long to wait the proposal will soon become clear the hon lady will welcome great deal of the change that we want to make as human right city york believe that disabled people should be at the heart of all decision making how have disabled people form the minister view in make these change have they be at the heart of the decision making my hon friend be right our manifesto have firm commitment that the view and voice of disabled people should be at the heart of everything that we do over the past week have have discussion with number of disabled people fora when we come forward with our proposal shortly we will consult extensively with disabled people and their organisation about the right way forward the government announce billion of cut to the department then over recent day minister have make turn after turn and in the medium round over the weekend be spin out of control be there anything meaningful leave to announce from the secretary of state original welfare plan the conservative party which leave broken welfare system that be fail the people who depend on it and taxpayer have year to put it right we know what their legacy be hon member will see the proposal soon but we will not shy away from the decision that we believe be right to give opportunity to people who can work security for those who can not and to get the welfare bill on sustainable footing today telegraph have do right hatchet job on the most socially deprive ward in my constituency the people of the east marsh be sick and tired of journalist take day trip to write their poverty porn story about people who be proud and keen to play their part in society in every way that they can they have seek to pit old people against young people highlight the neet record the young people in that ward be as keen to work as anyone else but they need the job to do it what discussion be the secretary of state have about that there will be no great representative for her constituent than my hon friend who rightly say that they want the right chance choice and support to work as anyone else do that be why we be create good job in every part of the country through our modern industrial strategy we be improve the quality of work and make work pay through our employment rights bill our get britain working plan will give the work skill and order it be topical question have few member still get in it be right that the welfare system support those with disability however do the secretary of state agree that social medium influencer who be teach people to game the motability system in order to get free vehicle be disgrace if so what do she intend to do about it the hon gentleman will be aware that this issue fall under the umbrella of wide fraud we inherit an appalling level of fraud in the welfare system under the previous government our fraud bill go some way to tackle that as part of broad package of billion the large ever package for tackle fraud give that nearly half of family in poverty have disabled member and that without pip an additional disabled household could be push into poverty be concerned that the rumour cut will not help people into work but instead drive they far into destitution what assurance can the minister give that the voice of disabled people have be hear and reflect on in the upcoming green paper give my hon friend firm assurance that not only have we be listen but we shall continue to listen once the proposal have be publish have previously urge the secretary of state to liaise with the department for communities in northern ireland over its pitiful pursuit of benefit fraud in the same vein be the minister aware that of the new vehicle register in northern ireland last year be under the motability scheme be that not indicative of appalling abuse of that scheme will he raise with the department for communities what it be do about that the motability scheme be highly value by disabled people around the uk if the hon and learn gentleman have example of misuse of that scheme would very much like to see they but it be scheme that be greatly prize right across the house think he would discover that if he talk to other member about it sentencing council guidelines urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make statement on the sentencing council publication of community and custodial sentence guideline the sentencing council be independent of parliament and government the council decide on its own priority and workplan for produce guideline the sentencing council consult the previous government on revise version of the imposition guideline which include new guidance on pre sentence report that consultation run from november to february the previous government respond to the consultation on the guideline on february the former sentencing minister the hon member for orpington gareth bacon who be now the shadow transport secretary write to the chair of the sentencing council thank he for the revision to the guideline in particular he thank the council for full guidance on the circumstance in which court should request pre sentence report the lord chancellor be clear about her discontent with the guideline when it be publish it be our view that there should not be differential treatment before the law the house will be pleased to hear that the lord chancellor meet the chair of the sentencing council last week and the discussion be constructive it be agree that the lord chancellor will set out her position more fully in writing which the sentencing council will consider before the guideline be due to come into effect in just day new two tier sentencing rule will come into force these sentencing rule will infect our ancient justice system with the virus of identity politic divide fellow citizen on the basis of their skin colour and religion the rule will ride roughshod over the rule of law and destroy confidence in our criminal justice system the stake be high but the justice secretary seem clueless in fact she be not even here have the department conduct an assessment of the additional pre sentence report that will be require and the impact of that on the probation service give that it be already work above capacity be it consider provide the probation service with additional resource to cope with the extra demand do it expect the additional pre sentence report to lead to further delay in our court ask these question because not only do these new rule violate the most foundational principle of equality before the law but they also create immense pressure on the criminal justice system if the justice secretary want to stop two tier justice she would have support my bill on friday she would have use her power of appointment to sack the individual who draft the rule time be run out and so be confidence in the sentencing council frankly the public be lose confidence in the justice secretary and her ministers too can not escape the conclusion that the justice secretary actually support these two tier sentencing rule why because she support group that call the criminal system institutionally racist her representative walk through the two tier guidance and approve it and she refuse to legislate to block the guidance come into force or to take any sanction against the member of the sentencing council that draft it if there be one thing we know about labour government it be that they always end in tear this time it be second tier justice secretary pursue two tier justice all to suck up to her boss two tier keir there be one thing that we know about labour government they always have to clear up the mess leave by conservative government that be what the lord chancellor be do at the moment she be clear up the mess leave by the previous government the clog up the court the overflowing prison and the overwork probation service get back to the fact of the case the lord chancellor meet the sentencing council last thursday and have constructive discussion it be agree that she will set out her position more fully in writing which the sentencing council will then consider before the guidance be due to come into effect this be serious government not audition for government the conservatives be not only consult they welcome these guideline when they be in office the former minister for sentencing write letter of welcome to the sentencing council set this out on february there be process in place now that need to be allow to play out we will not pre empt that process call the chair of the justice committee the sentencing council be it should not need say non political body whose guideline be carefully draft and widely consult on these guideline receive positive response from the justice committee under its previous chair and from the previous government they do not require that pre sentence report be order they do not limit who should be the subject of such report and they do not tie the hand of the sentencer do my hon friend agree that by drag the sentencing council into the political arena without good cause the shadow justice secretary degrade both the sentencing council and himself my hon friend the chair of the select committee make good point about the way in which the shadow justice secretary conduct himself the important thing be that the lord chancellor have constructive meeting with the chair of the sentencing council and there be now process in place to address this issue call the liberal democrat spokesperson would like to think that all in this house believe in equality under the law in sentencing matter and otherwise but it be clear that two tier justice have exist in our country have be govern by two tier tories who think they could get away with illegal no party while the rest of we be tell to stay at home two tier tories such as the shadow justice secretary who unlawfully approve development for his donor and two tier tories who have pummel our prison and crash our court leave victim to pay the price can the minister tell we how he will reform sentencing in england and wales to protect the victim and survivor so let down by the conservatives the hon member be perfectly right to underline the importance of equality before the law he give the opportunity to give plug to the independent review of sentencing be conduct by david gauke with an independent panel which will address the issue that he have raise do my hon friend agree that if there be two tier justice system it be not the one claim by the conservatives but it be certainly one that be create by they one where victim of crime be let down by delay where working class community see justice delay and deny and where the reality remain that black and ethnic minority defendant be disproportionately sentence do he agree that instead of play political game with sentencing we should focus on deliver real justice ensure that every decision make in our court be base on evidence not culture war or headline in right wing rag my hon friend be right to contrast the approach of the soundbite from the shadow justice secretary with the justice secretary approach of roll up her sleeve and get on with the job of sort out the mess leave in our prison probation service and court just to be constructive for moment and to try to get bit of consensus surely no one be suggest that anybody in parliament want to restrict the power of judge and their traditional right to sentence people accord to their own light all we be question be whether quango like the sentencing council should try to stack the deck against certain group all we be say be that judge should impose sentence irrespective of people race colour or whatever the father of the house and my constituency neighbour bring constructive note and agree with exactly what he say we have an independent judiciary that we should let get on with the job as former magistrate have be personally involve in sentencing decision and have rely on and can attest to the importance of pre sentence report give as much information about an offender as possible before decide an appropriate sentence use properly they can cut reoffende rate do the minister agree that pre sentencing report should therefore be available for all offender and that access should not be determine by an offender ethnicity culture or faith my hon friend be exactly right that pre sentence report play an important role and we ought to applaud the work that the probation service and other do in prepare those report she be exactly right to point to how effective they be in help with sentencing the minister be right to stress the independence of the sentencing council but would he accept that he can not criticise the shadow secretary of state for have view on these draft guideline when the secretary of state herself do exactly that also ask he to consider in this debate the real purpose of pre sentence report it be there to give more information about an offender but it also enable judge to impose non custodial sentence if they believe that be the appropriate course it be hard for sentencer to do that unless someone have be assess as suitable for community penalty whatever the right and wrong of this debate be it not important that the sentencing council make clear that what be important in decide whether to ask for pre sentence report be whether that extra information be need and not anything else include protect characteristic that be exactly what the lord chancellor be say do the minister agree that there be fatal flaw in the case of the shadow justice secretary his party work for month to develop the very guideline about which they now complain do the minister far agree that rather than desperately score an own goal for his party the right hon member should get behind this government reform to clear up the mess leave by the conservatives to be fair to the conservatives they do not work on the guideline but they be consult on they and they do respond to they in positive way note the comment by the chair of the sentencing council lord justice william davis who say that both labour and conservative ministers or their representative have know about the plan since and do not object while be disappointed that the government be only act reactively now do the minister not agree that the shadow secretary of state have no shame and that it be hard to take his faux outrage seriously when this be just another audition for tory leader the hon lady have say what everybody else in this house and outside it be think do the minister agree that the conservatives have some explain to do give that the sentencing council consultation on the guideline that recommend differ approach for those from an ethnic minority background be undertake during the previous government that the previous government be statutory consultee and that it be welcome by the government at the time my hon friend be exactly right the previous government be fully involve in the consultation and not only be they fully involve but they welcome it come to this fresh as one without legal background it seem to that there be matter here of very great importance that ought to be properly debate by this house do the minister agree that this be yet another classic example of where the much vaunted separation of power be likely to interfere with the process this be the third consecutive week in which we have discuss this in the house we discuss it in the lord chancellor statement we discuss it at justice question last week and we be discuss it again today thank the minister for his response it have already be mention that pre sentencing report be important for judge however do he agree that pre sentence report should be available for all offender and that their availability should not be determine by an offender ethnicity culture or faith far to what the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde say we also have two tier probation system under the last government absolutely agree with my hon friend point do the sentencing council understand that with these guideline it be totally out of touch with the mood of the british people totally out of touch with the mood of the government and totally out of touch with the mood of the house and therefore why will it not agree to delay these guideline until they have be properly debate in this house to be fair the chair of the sentencing council meet the lord chancellor last week and it be constructive meeting he be await letter from the lord chancellor which he promise the sentencing council will consider and respond to before april as former local authority lead for youth justice see at first hand how important pre sentencing report can be in shape effective and progressive outcome in justice however it can not be right that access to they be determine by factor such as race and religion applaud the justice team for make such strong and robust response to the sentencing council guidance so far can the minister assure that unlike the last government who be clearly asleep at the wheel during the consultation we remain willing to take whatever action be need to uphold this important principle agree with my hon friend that the last government appear to have be asleep at the wheel rediscover their mojo only once they be in opposition last week the prime minister announce that he be abolish nhs england to make sure the nhs be bring back under democratic control will the minister be lobby the prime minister to abolish the sentencing council to make sure sentencing be bring back under democratic control thank the former common sense minister for her question you would understand common sense if the right hon lady stop gabbling and listen will attempt to answer her question think the right hon lady be get little ahead of herself there be process in place and there have be constructive meeting with the sentencing council letter be be send to the sentencing council and the sentencing council will respond do not believe the shadow secretary of state believe that the law be currently apply equally and free of structural bias but give the unfortunate politicisation of all this do the minister now back the chair of the sentencing council who say that the state should not determine the sentence impose on an individual offender and that sentence guideline of any kind if they be to be dictate in any way by minister would breach an important principle certain thing be matter of policy and they be for the government and for parliament we have have constructive meeting with the sentencing council letter be go to the sentencing council and the sentencing council will respond we totally respect the independence of our judiciary just the other week the lord chancellor make it clear that she do not agree with the direction in which the sentencing council be go and think we all hope that her meeting with the sentencing council will produce result however if they do not will the minister commit to work across party think there be real commitment on the opposition benches to work with he to bring forward emergency legislation if that be require thank the right hon member for the constructive tone of his question refer he to the point about our not want to get ahead of ourselves we need to allow the process to go forward and to respect the sentencing council role in it we will address thing when we need to address they we be in the bizarre position where the body that advise judge on how to judge may decide to go to court for ruling on whether ministers have the power to tell judge what to do what preparation have the minister department make for that possibility be afraid that be become bit repetitive there be desire from opposition members to rush ahead and have great respect for well you have year and what do you do in they interruption sorry mr speaker not you opposition members be try to rush ahead we will take thing steadily at the right pace with proper respect on point of great importance to the lord chancellor she be reduce to ask the sentencing council to change its mind the former minister for common sense be right there be lesson here for all parliamentarian about the way we delegate power to quangos that then come up with solution that we clearly find repulsive there be constructive meeting if the right hon member have be in it do not think he would have see it as somebody ask there be constructive exchange of view and there be proper process in place which be confident will come up with the right answer it be obviously ridiculous that the justice secretary be on her knee before quango ask it to respect the principle of equality before the law but this be not the only example the judicial college equal treatment handbook say to treat some person equally we must treat they differently will the minister condemn that logic and say no we must not treat defendant differently because of their race or religion the government do not believe that there should be differential treatment before the law the lord chancellor have be very clear about that the equal treatment bench book to which the hon member allude be write by and for the judge minister have no involvement whatsoever in its content do the minister agree with and many of my hon friend that policy decision by unelected non departmental body such as the sentencing council be erode public confidence in our democratic institution will he commit to scrap such body so that policy be always make by ministers who be directly accountable to this house policy decision should always be make by this house the hon member be absolutely correct about that the background to where we be today be that the sentencing council consult the government of the day member of whom be now on the opposition benches the member of that government be asleep at the wheel now it be down to this government yet again to pick up the piece they leave for we and sort out their mess my constituent be confused about the justice secretary position she say she believe that these sentencing guideline be wrong in principle and that they amount to differential treatment before the law but she be in government she have the power and the tool at her disposal to stop this and change it why have she not do so have try to explain this and will explain it once more the justice secretary the lord chancellor have be extremely clear that she believe in equality before the law and she be not happy with the guideline that be why she write as soon as they be publish unlike conservative members who have sight of they early in the consultation they go far than ignore they they respond to they in very positive way order know you like to think that in order to keep talk one of we be go to sit down it be not go to be minister there be other thing to do and point of order to follow the minister be an honourable man and have to ask question on behalf of the victim if he do not mind he will understand that any reform of sentencing must have victim at its heart for most victim their concern be not the ethnicity of the perpetrator but the severity of the crime and the last impact on their life many victim today will feel that the sentencing guideline play politic with justice how can victim be assure that justice will mean time serve for crime commit and will not be base on ethnicity justice be blind and so must sentencing be the hon gentleman will not be surprised to learn that agree with he the victim minister my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones be sit next to we take victim very seriously that be why there be victim representative on the sentencing review panel we need to make sure that victim be at the centre of whatever we do have meet too many victim already in this role and every time meet they it be very difficult little difficult for but hugely difficult for they because they live this it seem like every week we be back here deal with culture war order be that reflection on grant the urgent question be begin to feel that it be aim at we have this urgent question today because think it be appropriate not because we have it every week right let have somebody else judge by the lack of action it appear that the justice secretary be comfortable with change that she have describe as two tier come into effect in just two week we have hear that she be unhappy if she really be can the minister tell the house and the country what the secretary of state be do other than hold cordial and cosy meeting to prevent two tier justice the lord chancellor have make her position clear she immediately meet the sentencing council and she be write to it again to set out her concern and the sentencing council have commit to respond to they quickly the minister complain about have to explain the government position but why can he not just explain to we why the secretary of state have not fix this issue yet it seem that there have be meeting but she have not even write letter in the last three week explain what she want to happen that be why thank you very much indeed mr speaker for grant this urgent question again the minister have not actually fix the problem that we be all talk about the consultation be hold under the previous government who not only express no concern but welcome what the sentencing council be do immediately on see the guideline as draft the lord chancellor act to sort out the mess leave by the conservative party the minister say that the situation be completely clear so feel like bit of an idiot for ask for more clarification but will anyway pre sentencing report be allow to take in further background on the life of offender from an ethnic minority cultural minority faith minority community what be the definition of cultural minority and be our veteran consider cultural minority the hon member read out phrase that be welcome by the previous government but that the lord chancellor be object to and talk to the sentencing council about on wednesday challenge the prime minister directly on two tier justice and give he the opportunity to confirm that he would back the shadow justice secretary bill to stop this in its track in his attempt to scramble out of give that commitment he say something which have be repeat today that the previous government be consult on and welcome the guidance however the sentencing council have already put in writing that the wording be different and so would lead to materially different outcome the government fail to take the opportunity that the shadow justice secretary present they with to block this change be the prime minister right in what he say or be the sentencing council right they can not both be the letter the previous government write to the sentencing council during the consultation be clear the previous government be not just consult they welcome the guidance the initial version of the guidance include reference to specific cohort of offender include ethnic minority on point of order mr speaker in his response to the urgent question the minister have repeatedly tell the house that the previous government approve the guideline in particular he besmirch the name of the former sentencing minister my hon friend the member for orpington gareth bacon what the minister say to the house today be wrong on page paragraph of the sentencing council letter of march to the justice secretary it make it perfectly clear that the guideline publish under this government be materially different from those consider by the prior government in fact the minister official be present at the meeting of the sentencing council at which this version of the guideline be sign off will he take the opportunity to correct the record be afraid that he have mislead the house not once not twice but on numerous occasion today and that be quite wrong order nobody mislead the house the right hon gentleman mean inadvertently mislead the house do hope it be inadvertent mr speaker far to that point of order mr speaker do not believe that inadvertently mislead the house with permission shall make statement about last week meeting of foreign ministers we meet at pivotal moment some member of this house may have doubt that we could find common ground and some of our global competitor may have hop that we would fail but after hour of talk we be unite britain unite with our ally to make our citizen more secure national security be foundation of this government plan

pummel ukraine my warning to mr putin be this if you be serious prove it with full and unconditional ceasefire now on whether putin will deliver must tell the house that see no sign yet that he will the meeting help we ready the tool to get russia to negotiate seriously we be not wait for the kremlin if it reject ceasefire we have more card that we can play we can all see the impact that the unprecedented sanction have have on russia falter economy social spending be down and inflation and interest rate be sky high there can be no let up in our effort in canada we discuss where we can go far to target russia energy and defence sector far squeeze its oil revenue and use frozen russian asset at the same time we will keep up our support to ukraine europeans clearly need to shoulder our share of this responsibility we in the uk be step up on drone munition and training send more than different capability to ukraine and train more than recruit we have also announce the big increase in uk defence spending since the end of the cold war we be urge our ally to do the same so that ukraine be in the strong possible position now and in any peace that follow tomorrow will be host eu high

able to discuss these matter with secretary rubio over the course of the three day at the and with vice president vance yesterday morning at his residence in washington the right hon lady rightly ask about russian asset let make it clear that russia must pay for the damage it be cause ukraine be delighted that the first million of the uk billion loan to be repay by the profit generate on russian sanctioned asset have be pay but she know that there be rightfully discussion about move from freeze to seize if we be to move in that direction it would be important for there to be unanimity among the and way forward within the european union for the most expose country as the right hon lady would expect we be discuss those very issue apace the right hon lady ask about uk troop on the ground at stake be not only the future of ukraine but the collective security of our continent and therefore britain direct national interest that be why the prime minister have say that europe need to step up and the uk be of course prepare to consider commit british troop on the ground but there must be us backstop there will be further meeting in london this week to continue to get into the operational detail the prime minister and be pleased alongside the defence secretary that the coalition of the willing be grow it be right that we consider carefully what would be require on the ground but the right hon lady will know too that the exercise of monitor what be put in place be very important no doubt she like will have see the operation that be run by the osce see it in january just before the fighting begin in the february that would not be adequate this time round so rightly and properly we must get into the granular detail of what would be require as the european family of course but also involve nation such as canada receive commitment from minister mélanie joly that canada be willing to step up to be part of that coalition but there will be other in that coalition of the willing and we will look at these issue in detail over the come day the right hon lady mention the situation in gaza and the middle east let make it absolutely clear that we be all unite in say that there could be no role for hamas we welcome the work that have be do by the arab quint as direction of travel the united kingdom want to continue to work with the quint on strengthen that proposal particularly on the security guarantee that the israelis would rightfully need their assurance that october can never ever happen again the right hon lady raise the situation in syria the awful clash during the weekend of and march lead to the death of more than people we condemn the violence at the time and the minister for the middle east my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer update the house on march it be critical for the interim administration in syria to respect and protect all syria minority which be why it be hearten to see the agreement last week between the interim administration and the syrian democratic forces particularly in north east syria this be obviously topic of much discussion the right hon lady rightly mention the strike by the us since november the houthis have target international commercial shipping in the red sea and the gulf of aden and attack british and american warship that can not go unchecked it be totally unacceptable and it must be deal with we do not of course comment on other nation military operation but can confirm that while we do not take part in the strike over the weekend we be in close touch with our us friend on the need to act in respect of the houthis and what they be do in the red sea the right hon lady talk about the government approach to china can assure she that there will not be seven different approach to china from this government which be what we experience under the last government who be ping ponge about over the course of those year as for the calamity of united kingdom prime minister have beer with the leader of the chinese communist party can give she guarantee that that will not happen under this government quite properly as the right hon lady know and the home secretary make representation to the planning process about the security issue that must be keep in mind as the proper procedure be follow for china application she also know that we too have concern about our embassy in china and its proper operation call the chair of the foreign affairs committee be so pleased to see the foreign secretary continue to lead our ally in support of ukraine and equally pleased to see that he have express his support for move from freeze to seize russian asset we have billion worth of they hold in the uk however if we be serious about do that we need to start get on with it what move be his department making for example put legislation on the book to allow we to seize those asset when the right time come be glad to hear that there be discussion on that but have pressure be put on our and eu ally who still sit on the remain billion worth of asset which perhaps need to be seize at this stage have he consider put forward un general assembly resolution to provide the legal basis for co ordinate asset seizure be grateful to my right hon friend for her question and of course for her leadership of the foreign affairs committee reassure she that we continue to work closely with our ally on this issue include through the lengthy discussion that we have at the but let emphasise that it be important in this particular area that any way forward involve pooling of that exercise do not believe that it would be right for the uk to act unilaterally in this instance therefore this be multilateral endeavour and discussion she be right to emphasise that we should work at pace and reassure she that we be do so call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement like he will focus on ukraine last week president zelensky announce his willingness to accept an immediate ceasefire in response vladimir putin intensify his attack on ukraine this give the lie to putin cheap talk about agree with the idea of ceasefire his goal remain the same to destroy ukraine sovereignty and turn it into satellite state of russia the only way to achieve just and last peace be by strengthen ukraine in the face of putin brutality so be slightly alarmed to hear the foreign secretary say that we can seize russian asset only if we progress by unanimity if the us refuse to seize russian asset will the foreign secretary take lead with european partner so that the support can flow can he also say what be stop he unlock the billion generate from the sale of chelsea football club which be hold here in the uk and should have already be use to provide humanitarian aid to ukraine the foreign secretary refer to the work that minister have be do to build coalition of the willing to support any final peace agreement in ukraine which my party strongly support but can he be more specific what level of support have other country commit and what progress have he make in secure backstop security guarantee from the united states the liberal democrats have warn repeatedly that donald trump action be embolden putin last month trump say that russia should rejoin the if peace settlement be agree that would be unjust and wrong do the foreign secretary make it clear to his counterpart that the uk would oppose russia rejoin the give that donald trump be not reliable ally the liberal democrats have argue that the uk must lead in europe to reduce the continent reliance on the united states we support the creation of pan european rearmament bank so that europe defence can be rapidly rebuild yet last week we see proposal from the european commission for eu structure that could leave the uk out will the foreign secretary use his meeting with high representative kallas tomorrow to make sure that the uk play full part in european effort to the benefit of our security and our defence industry be very grateful to the hon gentleman for continue the cross party unity he be usually pretty on top of the detail but just say to he that it be not the united states that have raise consistent concern about sovereign asset it be not the united states in this instance that be more exposed than other it be actually in europe belgian colleague have find themselves more exposed and german colleague have previously be resistant on this issue but there be of course change of administration come in germany so we will see what their assessment be on those fund from abramovich which of course we want to use just say and should have say this to the right hon member for witham priti patel that we inherit this matter from the last government in two and half year no progress be make be frustrate with that lack of progress and be do everything can to reach resolution if we do not will have to consider all the tool available to government however what want at this stage be to be able to act quickly give that the hon gentleman know know and we all know that ukraine need those fund now therefore work with other colleague and mr abramovich lawyer we urge action now say to the hon gentleman that there be no discussion of russia join the no discussion whatsoever the be family of democratic nation commit to the rule of law russia under putin have put itself way outside that club and that necessary partnership see no basis at the moment on which russia could enter the and indeed there would be other candidate way ahead of russia be that to be the case be delighted that the lib dems have proposal for rearmament bank but would just say to they that ursula von der leyen get there before they rise order to ensure that all colleague can get in question will have to be short and if the answer continue to be long there will be some disappointed back benchers welcome my right hon friend strong statement that blockade all aid into gaza include uk aid be appalling and unacceptable what discussion do he have with colleague about what can be do about this provocative action during ramadan and what consequence be there for what people be say be breach of international law my hon friend be right this be breach of international law israel quite rightly must defend its own security but we find the lack of aid and it have now be day since aid get into gaza unacceptable hugely alarming and very worrying we urge israel to get back to the number of truck we be see go in way beyond so that palestinians can get the necessary humanitarian support they need at this time welcome the foreign secretary statement and all his hard work in travel all around the world try to make we all safe he mention the osce and while the previous model in ukraine may not be fit for the future hope he recognise the important role that the osce will play in future election in ukraine perhaps with new model alongside security force may bring the foreign secretary attention to the joint statement from canada it highlight that iran be the principal source of regional instability and some would argue of global instability and insecurity in his statement today he say tehran be produce highly enriched uranium at rate that make mockery of the limit set in the joint comprehensive plan of action if israel with or without us support take direct action to make the world safe place and to stop iran acquire nuclear weapon will the uk government support that action be grateful to the right hon gentleman for raise the issue of iran desire to have nuclear capability we stand in the way of that work with the germans and the french we be determined to use all diplomatic effort to bring about conclusion to that desire of course discuss that with secretary of state rubio alongside my french and german counterpart at the but we also discuss maximum pressure and we discuss that nothing be off the table as we discuss these issue with iran we be run out of time to reach resolution to this issue welcome the foreign secretary uncompromise message to vladimir putin wonder whether he would add to that clear message that there can be no peace while ten of thousand of ukrainian child who have be steal from their parent and scatter across russia be not return do he share my concern at report that yale university humanitarian

entry in the register of members financial interests the secretary of state for foreign affairs rightly set out very well and in detail the broad range of challenge that be discuss at the one area he touch on be the threat of the houthis who of course be be support by al shabaab in somalia the republic of somaliland be the only democratic country in the area that be valiantly try to fight the terrorist threat will he commit to his department work with the government of the republic of somaliland to deal with the threat it face and which we also face can reassure the right hon gentleman

not just on the humanitarian side but on the political side to bring this conflict to an end the foreign secretary be clearly busy man so understand why we have not see he since the prime minister announce cut to the overseas development budget on february can ask he now then whether the consequence of slash overseas aid be discuss at the and how he explain to our partner that withdraw lifesave aid to the poor people on the planet thereby make they even more dependent on russia and china would in the long run make we all safe and more secure may just say to the hon gentleman that he be occasionally wrong laughter very occasionally the prime minister make statement about defence spending which be applaud right across the european family and certainly in the united states it be essential he come back the follow week and make another statement on lead effort within europe and be sit right next to he will just say to the hon gentleman that he need to get his eye test on development aid which be an important issue we have not make an ideological decision we do not want cliff edge it be important that the hon gentleman know that foreign policy diplomatic effort development effort and of course hard power be part of family of tool he should never forget that war in ukraine have cost the african continent billion that be why it be right that we develop our defence and continue to spend aid in ukraine my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall must have be read my note early will raise the same issue again

we make to development spend our commitment to humanitarian effort be make to ukraine this be an area where my hon friend could expect to see the uk continue to fund support it be good to hear that the believe that iran should not be allow to build nuclear bomb which be statement of the obvious it be also good to hear that president trump have send strongly word letter to the supreme leader do the foreign secretary agree that the jcpoa be dead in the water the minute that president trump pull out in he talk of what we might do now and say that nothing be off the table would the foreign secretary confirm that that include military action must let mr trump speak for himself when he say that nothing be off the table in deal with iran be pleased that in work alongside the americans they recognise the important role that we the french and the germans play and that maximum pressure be essential we have make it clear to the iranians that that snapback and the sanction that would follow squeeze the iranian economy at time when everyone accept that iran be weak be not what they want they need to get serious about their nuclear ambition we will work on all track the right hon gentleman

vol note that he have use that phrase again this afternoon give the increasingly mercurial nature of our american ally support of ukraine what progress have be make what be the foreign secretary good estimate of when our ukrainian friend will be able to benefit from those frozen asset understand why the hon lady raise her question as say to the liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for

minister be rightly lead coalition of the willing would he and the government lead coalition of the willing nation who will seize those frozen asset as right across europe we see cost of live crisis it be right and proper that we pool our effort and that respective treasury departments and finance ministers be satisfied that seize those asset would not have detrimental effect on the global economy those necessary discussion be be hold the hon gentleman know my emphasis but assure he that europe be more united on these issue than reform be currently thank the foreign secretary for his statement last week host westminster hall debate on the international fund for israeli palestinian peace be the foreign secretary able to raise that matter at the foreign ministers meeting might he

friend will know that the united kingdom support the palestinian authority and the necessary reform that they need to make assure he that or indeed the minister for the middle east will meet and discuss these issue far the foreign secretary describe the blocking of aid to gaza in his statement as appal and unacceptable why do he not also confirm that it be illegal and in breach of international law as be the continue bombardment of gaza and the bombardment of the west bank when will the british government finally say to israel we will no long supply weapon to you and we will no long continue security co operation while you continue to illegally occupy territory and commit war crime in both gaza and the west bank do say in my contribution that israel be in breach of international humanitarian law of course we have speak to the israelis about those concern indeed the right hon gentleman will recall the decision that make back in september to suspend arm sale which be largely because of that breach early today in parliament chair an event to remember the victim of the appalling chemical weapon attack at halabja on march carry out by the vicious saddam hussein regime they thank the uk for our help and friendship over the year do my right hon friend agree that that and current crisis show the need for strong uk what mean by that be strong armed force strong

hugely important that the united kingdom as member continue to support our armed service and hard power but our soft power our diplomatic effort and our development spend we will still be the sixth big development spender in the world be hugely important last spring the uk join the united states in conduct five combine joint naval and airstrike against the houthis this weekend the us conduct airstrike without participation from the raf except routine refuelling support why the change what do that signal about british foreign policy do the foreign secretary consider that get us involvement in backstop in ukraine be more challenging when the us have to operate alone against the houthis the united kingdom be involve to the extent of support us effort on refuelling do not think that it would be right for to comment on the detail of any military exercise but reassure the hon member that we continue to work closely with our friend in the united states as he would expect be brief on these issue alongside the prime minister and other thank the secretary of state for his statement and his strong word which be much appreciated welcome the reaffirmation of support for ukraine contain in the statement as well as the continuation of support for peaceful resolution in israel and gaza however peace can not come at the price of appeasement of russia or of the hamas terrorist murderer

gaza border and in ukraine can have food medicine clothing and an education while these complex thing be sort out be sure the whole house be hugely grateful for the humanity that the hon gentleman have show once again on the issue of child on both side of this conflict it be horrendous when one look at the scene of those hostage come out that among those hooded young man with kalashnikovs there

carve out for those who need they for example as health device so hope he be reassure on that point attempt by the tech industry to lobby to muddy the water to run interference and to sow confusion be unconvincing the problem hit our child all over the world be not just coincidence there be more and more evidence for causal link for example sapien labs ask question about adult mental health and combine they into mental health quotient score they ask the same people when they first get smartphone and the result be stark the early someone get phone the bad their mental health particularly for girl as with smoking powerful social gradient be also develop with smartphone and social medium that be go to widen gap in school achievement unless something decisive be do sadly many people still do not know about the risk from smartphone but grow number of parent do know and be worried about the problem with smartphone and social medium but we face collective action problem we worry that our kid will miss out if they be the only one without they and that be the problem that need solve and government need to be part of that across this country there have be an explosion of parent power campaign group aim to fight back include smartphone free childhood safe screens delay smartphones and the new rage against the screen campaign over the last year they have gain hundred of thousand of member and together with the shadow secretary of state and the leader of the opposition we meet some of they this morning and pay tribute to they for their work when visit school across my constituency find that many have institute policy ban mobile phone or indeed be consult on do so sometimes there be small degree of pushback from pupil and sometimes indeed from parent but do my hon friend agree that if the government take up this amendment it will make it clear and easy for school to ban these phone and produce safe and nurture environment for our pupil in school and it would be easy to take this forward my hon friend be completely correct and be go to come on to that very point the children commissioner have say honestly think that we will look back in year time and be absolutely horrify by what we allow our child to be expose to and she be right the very first thing government could do be implement proper ban on phone in our school parentkind recently say to effectively we be allow our kid to be feed digital drug and we be even allow the dealer into the school that have to change the last government issue guidance it be good start but it be not enough and be not work while of school say they have some sort of policy or some sort of ban survey by policy exchange last year find that only one in secondary school have full start to finish ban the policy that work well lot of school be still try policy where kid have their phone on they but be not suppose to have they out the effect be that the kid be distract the teacher have to stop lesson to tell they to put they away and we get all of the issue about bullying and social medium during break time and more as the hon and learn member for folkestone and hythe tony vaughan labour member point out the other day guidance introduce by the previous government be not work we still have student use phone during break time and during lesson and this cause significant problem have have many teacher say to this take up so much time it huge distraction it interfere with learn that be right and we be now in the strange situation where labour mp and the conservative party agree that the guidance have turn out not to be enough but the labour front bench be insist that it be we be through the look glass why do we need full ban not just guidance our general approach be of course to give autonomy to school but first the guidance be not work the department for education own national behaviour survey publish in april last year find that of secondary school teacher report mobile phone be use during lesson without permission and the problem be more pronounced for old child of pupil in year to report mobile phone be use when they should not have be during most or all lesson and last month survey by parentkind find that nearly half of secondary school child say they see phone be use in class where they should not be every single day so the idea that the guidance have do the trick and there be no long problem to solve be contradict by the department and the government own datum secondly we need to support school and have their back know from speak to teacher and school leader that the pressure from minority of parent to allow phone can be very severe minority of parent can be unreasonably determined that they must be able to contact their child directly at any minute of the day but unfortunately that come at cost to everyone else education as my hon friend the member for epping forest dr hudson point out national ban would make thing much simple we the politician should take the flack and take the heat off school thirdly full and full on ban be need as the start of wide resetting of social norm about child and smartphone and social medium we need proper ban so that kid smartphone be put away for whole day include break break should be about physical activity not just scroll and scroll school should be the beachhead and the first place where we re create the smartphone free childhood that most of we get to enjoy seven hour in which we de normalise be on the phone all the time for young people ban on smartphone in school will of course not solve all the problem overnight but it be vital first step when be health minister want we to develop an equivalent of the five bit of fruit and veg day campaign or public health campaign such as do die of ignorance or clunk click every trip which old member might remember we need to do some big thing to reset the culture the heavy exposure of our kid to addictive by design product from the tech industry be the smoking of our generation the other day the education secretary say that smartphone have no place in school yet today the government be go to whip labour mp to vote against get smartphone out of our school that be just silly have initially claim that our proposal for ban be gimmick the education secretary now seem to be execute very slow turn however when hon member look at the datum on what smartphone and social medium be do to our kid they will realise that we can not wait for the education secretary to swallow her pride we need to get on with it pattern be emerge at the start of the debate on the bill we and many in the education profession point out that the bill would threaten to cut teacher pay but the education secretary say that that be not true and we do not understand however she be later force to produce page and page of amendment to her own bill and it turn out that it be not we who do not understand the legislation last summer michael gove be be hold up by the secretary of state as the great satan of education but in her most recent speech he have become great education reformer just week ago ban smartphone from our school be gimmick but over the weekend we learn from the secretary of state that they have no place in our school so the policy be gimmick but they have no place in our school although they be go to vote against ban today think we can all see where this be go tonight labour members should swallow their pride vote for our new clause and do the right thing for our child call the chair of the education committee rise to speak in support of new clause and which both stand in my name the education committee be afford little time to undertake scrutiny of this important bill but we work hard to do so refocus our ongoing inquiry on child social care to focus on part of the bill and hold an additional evidence session to look at part be grateful to all the witness who come to give we their evidence we have publish report for the secretary of state set out recommendation base on the evidence we receive broadly the committee welcome the scale of the government ambition as express in the bill which be key plank of the government opportunity mission to break the link between young people background and their future success we join the government in want to see high and rise standard in our education and care system to protect vulnerable child and ensure educational opportunity for every child we welcome the measure in the bill to strengthen child protection particularly the provision to establish multi agency child protection team include education in safeguard arrangement and single unique identifier for child which have the potential to be genuinely transformative for the delivery of many of the service that support child and young people we support the measure to improve the child social care market through regional commissioning and financial oversight scheme action to remove profiteer in the child social care sector be long overdue the committee welcome the measure in the bill that will enable more child to remain within their kinship network or where residential placement in kinship care be not possible in contact with family and friend the committee also make some recommendation on way in which the bill could be strengthen base on the evidence we receive the amendment table in my name relate directly to our recommendation and will now turn to each recommendation that be relevant to part of the bill new clause would require the government to publish and consult on draft national offer for care leaver within month of the bill come into force national care offer would set minimum standard for local care offer and ensure great consistency between local authority area national offer would act as floor not ceiling it would not be design to prevent innovation at local level or to stop additional commitment be make by individual local authority but we believe that great national consistency drive by government would make big difference the evidence of the unacceptably poor outcome for care experience young people be shocking some of care leaver aged to be not in education employment or training compare with of all young people in the same age group some of young people with care experience go to university compare with almost half of their peer and care leaver be more likely to drop out of university third of care leaver become homeless within two year of leave care and of homeless people have be in care care leaver be hugely over represent in the criminal justice system these be young people whose corporate parent have be the state and these statistic be clear evidence that for many of they the state be not very good parent welcome the government amendment of the bill to introduce additional corporate parenting responsibility but the committee hear that there be significant disparity in the support that different local authority offer to care leaver we hear about the difference in support with bursary to pay for university accommodation access to wi fi to be able to study and ringfence apprenticeship for care leaver in local authority in powerful evidence session in which the committee hear from young adult with recent experience of the care system one witness tell we that there need to be national offer for care leaver the postcode lottery be profound another point to lack of awareness of the need of care experience people across the wide network of public service she tell we that when have go to the jobcentre they be very ill prepared they do not know any support for care leaver there be certain grant could have have to get back into education they do not inform in fact everything that have do now be from google it or ask people that should not be the case national care offer would be the foundation for build well more consistent support for care leaver everywhere in the country it would provide the government with an effective mechanism for hold local authority to account on the quality of their provision make it much easy for care experience people to understand what support should be there for they and stop the current disincentive to leave home to go to university because of uncertainty about the support when they get there urge the government to support new clause new clause would require health assessment of child in the care system to include assessment by mental health practitioner it would make assess the mental health of child in care core part of the health assessment of those child by ensure that mental health practitioner be involve child in care be significantly more likely to have experience trauma and abuse than their peer and they be consequently more likely to experience mental ill health in of child in care have mental health disorder rise to among those in residential care compare with of all child age five to the care experience young adult who give powerful evidence to the committee speak strongly about the urgent need for well mental health support and suggest that local authority be not always fulfil their obligation to include emotional and mental health in their health assessment of child in care one of our witness tell we grow up it be only physical assessment we do not have mental health check in at all think if my mental health be take more seriously from young age if have that person to check in with would probably be so much well would not have mental health problem grow up do think that mental health check in be equally as important if not more important as physical check in for child in care another witness say that look after child should get mandatory assessment as with physical health also if they be refer to camhs the waitlist be horrific right now look after child should have fast track and there should be more funding for specialist team we hear very movingly from witness who speak about the need for more trauma inform training for foster carer and other professional work with child in care she say feel lot could be explain if they understand the experience of trauma it will take time it will not go away at night and sometimes before it get well it could get bad no one talk about that you will not be okay if you be go into care there be reason why you be there and so it be important that the minute you go into care every child should have mandatory assessment physical and mental and there should be that on call support for they it be the trauma that underlie the decision to take child into care the abuse neglect bereavement or exploitation that often have the most profound impact on their life our care system need to place deal with that trauma in child centre way at its heart ensure that mental health assessment be properly undertake be an essential requirement of such system because mental health must be assess before treatment and support can be provide new clause would help to deliver that badly need refocusing of the system and urge the government to support it wish to make two further point first support new clause which stand in the name of my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh it would introduce requirement to notify child school and gp when they be place in temporary accommodation as constituency mp in south east london see the horrific impact of poor quality unstable temporary accommodation on child in my constituency every week temporary accommodation be harm child whether through the sleep deprivation of have to get up at be to travel long distance to their school the lack of space to do homework the fear and insecurity of share kitchen and bathroom with stranger the physical health impact of live with damp and mould or the impact on gross motor development of be in space that be too small to crawl or play in the impact be profound so it be completely right that there should be statutory requirement to notify the public service that have the ability to help mitigate such impact and which have responsibility for child health and wellbee when that child be place in temporary accommodation the government should be take urgent action to reduce the number of people in temporary accommodation especially family with child however in the short term the new duty introduce by my hon friend new clause would make difference to the support those child receive finally at the same time as we be debate this bill the government be prepare to announce reform to the welfare system wish to emphasise the vital importance of consider the impact on child of any propose reform child do not get to choose the family into which they be bear but each one be equally deserving of economic security and access to the resource they need to thrive it be not justifiable outcome of change to the welfare system to make life hard for the poor child or to increase child poverty by limit the access to support that their parent receive the government must undertake and publish an assessment of the impact of their welfare reform on child and must ensure that child do not suffer as result of any plan reform call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be pleasure and privilege to rise to speak on part of the bill and in particular on the new clause and amendment that stand in my name when the bill have its second reading say that there be much in it that liberal democrat members welcome alongside area that we would seek to amend probe and strengthen its progress in recent week have see plenty of debate discussion and opportunity to constructively strengthen the legislation although the government have fail to accept any amendment that be not their own despite the minister comment in his opening speech be grateful to colleague from across the house who serve on the committee in which we have some excellent debate however be disappoint last week to see the sheer number of amendment table by the government ahead of report really hope that the government do not make habit of deprive committees of their chance to properly scrutinise bills even if most of those measure be welcome and uncontroversial turn to the new clause and amendment that stand in my name as the minister know care particularly kinship care be subject that be close to my heart and those of my liberal democrat colleague in committee we discuss number of encourage provision that be include in the bill include those deal with the definition of kinship care set out in law the support that kinship carer be eligible for and provide additional educational support for child in kinship care however what we agree in committee fall far short of the ambition that hear the secretary of state herself set out at reception for kinship carer just few month ago at that reception the secretary of state unusually for somebody in her position call on campaigner and policymaker to keep push she believe that new clause and which stand in my name do just that new clause would ensure that kinship carer be entitle to pay employment leave new clause would put into statute an entitlement to an allowance on par with that of foster carer new clause would extend the pupil premium plus to all child in kinship care base on the definition that be in the bill and new clause would prioritise those same child for school admission kinship carer be unsung hero often step up at no notice to look after child they be relate to or know because that child parent can no long do so time and again we hear from kinship carer that they want to do the right thing out of love for those family member but financial and other barrier often stand in their way one survey reveal that of kinship carer give up work and similar proportion have to reduce their hour permanently put financial strain on the family these carer be disproportionately woman and they be over represent in the healthcare education and social care sector so this issue simply exacerbate our workforce crisis in public service in committee the minister point to the kinship financial allowance pilot which run in tiny number of local authority and involve very small subset of kinship carer that be not ambitious enough we must go far and give kinship carer parity with foster carer that will help save money in the short and long term amendment in my name would apply clause to independent special school the clause ensure that there be the backstop of profit cap on certain social care provider as liberal recognise the importance of private voluntary sector and state provision in this area as in many other public service but in this case it be clear that we have market that be simply not function and there be provider shamelessly profiteer from the lack of specialist provision and leave local authority finance crippled in surrey alone spend on private special educational need school have rise from million in to million in these school be often back by private equity firm and they be charge local authority extortionate fee on average double those in the state sector they be drain public fund but council have no choice but to place child in these school due to lack of state provision do my hon friend agree that extend the profit cap to independent school be essential to protect public finance and ensure fairer funding for child with special educational need have not share my speech with my hon friend but she have anticipate the next couple of point that be about to make agree with she strongly preface my comment by say that there be many independent special school run by private or voluntary sector provider that do an excellent job and be certainly not profiteer in the way that be about to set out clearly however that be not the case across the board with some firm make upwards of in profit on what they charge we must challenge whether that be justify the crisis in state special educational need and disability provision and the lack of specialist place have lead to growth in private provision that be crippling local authority finance as my hon friend just say in council spend billion on independent and non maintain special school twice what they spend just six year previously the average cost of one of those place be which as my hon friend say be twice the average cost of state run special school place many of the company run these school be the very same private equity company run the child home and foster agency that clause be design to deal with so be at loss as to why the government have not include independent special school in the clause urge they to think again and accept our amendment my new clause would impose requirement on the secretary of state to introduce national wellbeing measurement programme for child and young people throughout england pay tribute to beewell pro bono economics and the wide our wellbee our voice coalition for their hard work in this area as have say several time during this bill progress be more than little surprised to find so little about child wellbee in bill with this title one in four child in the uk report low wellbeing and accord to the programme for international student assessment datum our country be the low rank in europe on that head datum on child wellbee and mental health be fragment across the nhs school and local authority it be crucial that we collect datum to understand the challenge that young people face and to develop solution and that we seek to understand the efficacy of those solution through the use of robust wellbeing datum welcome the conservatives new clause on wellbee phone and social medium both as parent and as parliamentarian in this unprecedented digital age we need to treat child social medium and phone addiction as public health issue we have long support the last government guidance that school should try to restrict mobile phone use during the school day with importantly proper mitigation that teacher and head can employ for young carer and those with medical condition who use their phone as medical device and in other local circumstance that teacher and head be well place to identify be the hon lady aware of the pilot scheme introduce in northern ireland by the education minister paul givan in some school all the child mobile phone be place in pouch so that they be never on show this could make the conservatives proposal acceptable to all and there be still provision for carer to keep their phone with they northern ireland have show what can be do with pilot scheme and it be great that the house be follow our lead it be always an honour to take an intervention from the hon gentleman and it be great to hear about the pilot scheme in northern ireland have read that the government in the republic of ireland have spend about million on issue those pouch to school across the country it would be useful and instructive for the uk government to look at how that pilot go but be not sure that we even need to wait for that school leader and parent be press we to go far now and we must listen put the guidance into law will ensure that school have the necessary support when they be challenge on their policy and the resource to implement mobile free environment headteacher in my constituency tell that it would cost his school budget to install locker or issue the pouch describe by the hon member for strangford jim shannon child must be able to learn in an environment that be free from the distraction of phone and the threat of bullying we have also see significant reduction in truancy in school where restriction have be robust welcome the hon lady comment on the new clause and also the cross party support that demonstrate that this be cross party issue and be not about party allegiance do she agree that the datum and the evidence promote by specialist such as jonathan haidt show that problem with literacy numeracy and focus among child have accelerate since the early which coincide with their access to phone when it come to what this government should be do it be an open and shut case the datum in the book to which the right hon and learn lady have refer be alarming last week in hampton in my constituency the smartphone free childhood campaign organise public meeting with local parent it be pretty full and the datum share there be also extremely alarming attend as both parent and the local member of parliament and be afraid come away feel even less of liberal than before go in and slightly more authoritarian however that be mainly because allow our child to grow up with the freedom of be away from such toxic environment be the right liberal thing to do let say gently to the right hon and learn lady and to those on both the conservative and the labour benches that be at school be only small part of child life it be only small fraction of that child time and we need to look at much broad measure than restrict phone use in school it be disappointing that during the committee stage of the data use and access bill neither labour nor conservative members support liberal democrat proposal to make the internet less addictive for child after the government decide to gut the safe phone bill the protection of children digital safety and data protection bill promote by the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister which have great deal of cross party support liberal democrat amendment to the data use and access bill offer member an opportunity to protect young people from the doom scroll algorithm that be make such powerful change to the way in which they live and interact it be disappointing that ministers do not seize that opportunity with both hand and hope they will think again as that bill progress through the house welcome new clause table by the hon member for lowestoft jess asato which would abolish the common law defence of reasonable punishment we need to ensure that all child be properly protect in law so that they can grow up safe happy and healthy the liberal democrats have be call for this for more than year we support the law change in scotland and wales and it be long overdue in england there be much in part of the bill on which there be cross party consensus number of amendment table by member on both side of the house seek to ensure that the government go far in safeguard and promote the wellbeing of our child which be surely one of the most important role of government hope that minister be in listen mode and that even if they will not take on board some of the new clause and amendment today they will do so as the bill progress to the other place after all it be our duty to ensure that every child in the country not only survive but thrive it be pleasure to speak about some very important amendment and new clause but also about body of work that move forward the country protection and support for some of the most vulnerable people in society which have not be do for long time before become member of parliament have the privilege of be the child lead for the local authority on which serve many member here may be the grandparent or parent of handful of kid but as any local authority lead will know we be corporate parent to many hundred in that role it be impossible not to be move by the testimony of the young people with whom we be work they have often undergo real moment of trauma and difficulty that would knock any of we for six in the face of that their resilience and their determination to better themselves should inspire we all as guardian of the country collective obligation to young people in care we owe it to they to fulfil our side of that corporate parenting role be therefore extremely happy to see government amendment to which widen the role of corporate parenting to other local stakeholder as local authority lead work with the care experienced campaigner terry galloway be happy to take on some of that work locally work with fantastic local stakeholder to broaden our obligation as corporate parent and to bring other local government body into the sphere of those who be try to do well by the young people in our care however it be clear that act in isolation can not be good enough and that without clear legislation require more local stakeholder to take on that important role we can never involve all the partner who can have such transformative impact on young people in care at that crucial early stage no parent would think of care for child as just narrow subset of his or her role and the state and our obligation as corporate parent should be no different be very glad to see these amendment many in the house and beyond have be campaign for they for some time include my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister who recommend some of these measure in his report on social care few year ago we see very little action in this area under the last government but be delighted that this government be waste no time in widen that obligation and therefore widen the scope of the corporate parent who have the back of some of our young people in care throughout the country be also glad to see the government amendment that strengthen information sharing have have to read great many difficult serious case review involve young people all over the country so know that there have be tragic incident after tragic incident owe to failure in information sharing and the failure of agency to work together effectively strengthen information sharing and multi agency working must be core element of better our obligation to safeguard young people in all local authority area and it will be truly welcome to see that in the bill clause and of the bill will strengthen our obligation to care leaver no parent would expect their obligation to young people in their care to end when they reach the age of and the state should be no different perversely child leave care could be rule intentionally homeless but strong and more widely available care offer for those who be leave care will empower local authority throughout the country to do more to live up to the obligation that we all have as parent to do right by young people long into adulthood number of amendment could be make to strengthen that provision the government may not be bring they forward today but be sure that we will continue to revisit proposal as we monitor how this new obligation for local authority play out the need to do right by young people can not end when they turn so we must think about how we can continue our role as corporate parent long into child life when they be young adult many of the young people with whom work as local authority lead would welcome extra support and be sure that many will welcome the start that the bill be make today alongside that it be fact pretty well appreciate across the house that the overly bureaucratic care system have not always do enough to recognise the importance of wide family network at really important moment in young people life so the clause bring forward strong commitment on family group decision making recognise the important role of kinship carer and strengthen the educational support available to those in kinship care be truly welcome so too although not in this bill be the government record financial commitment to expand the kinship care pilot and ensure that we start to understand the value that wide financial support could have in enable more young people to be look after by member of their wide family network rather than fall into more formalised care in order to do right by young people and protect their wellbeing whether through reform send have further conversation about smartphone or keep young people safe online there be further work for this government to do it be very welcome to hear the minister in respond to the private member bill on safe phone confirm this government commitment to continue to do more in this space in future in the meantime however be very happy to support do the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds want to intervene think the hon gentleman will find that what the government commit to do be some research think the right hon gentleman will find that the minister do not just commit to do some research he commit to bring forward statement on some really important aspect of online health on which the government have not formally comment before gently suggest that if the opposition be so clear of the six education secretaries we have between and last year election do any of they propose ban mobile phone in school or be this the late bandwagon from the opposition thank my hon friend who could not have put my next point well completely recognise that this be really important topic it be important for parent and school right across my constituency too but be afraid the idea that have have year to bring this forward the conservatives have suddenly have damascene conversion to the idea that this be something that can not wait and must be deliver now at time when there be not clear consensus among educational professional or parent about the good way to bring such ban into effect feel disingenuous at well share lot of their concern and over time hope to be able work across this house to bring forward good protection to that effect what simply will not do be indulge this attempt to turn the issue into an opportunity for the conservative party to posture because it have so long and do so little on this work in conclusion be very glad to be support bill that deliver step change in protection for young people step change in support for care leaver and step change in support for kinship carer for too long we have not do enough to look after some of the most vulnerable young people in our society and be glad that this bill and some of the government amendment underline our commitment to ensure that we do far well on this front than the last government do urge member to ensure that they keep their language respectful at all time rise to speak to clause and the important issue of look after child which think member from across the house care about greatly it be for that reason that the bill be so disappointing because there be miss opportunity on supply and demand and particularly on my concern represent rural constituency with cheap housing about the concentration of look after child in particular community which the bill regional commissioning fail to address sufficiently will take those issue in order start with supply in committee there be lot of discussion about profiteer and be sure the minister will respond to my pointing out that the bill be silent on address the real and probably share issue of how we boost supply by pivot to talk of the profit clawback my concern about the profit clawback be that when the minister come to claw back the money he will find that it have long since move it would perhaps be helpful if the minister could clarify the estimate that have be give to the treasury for how much the department expect to recover in clawback because the opposition suspect that it will not be particularly effective likewise there be miss opportunity in the bill for reduce demand and very much echo the point make by my hon friend the member for harborough oadby and wigston neil in committee about boost foster carer an issue that be frequently debate in this house accept that be not panacea for all the issue affect look after child particularly those need secure accommodation but one would have expect the bill to go far in that regard it be also the case that what the government be do about unaccompanied child migrant be far exacerbate demand draw the minister attention to the home office research which show massive increase not only in the number of unaccompanied child migrant but in the number of dispute case where people claim to be child when there be concern that they be adult in half of those individual be find to be an adult that be far stoke demand and it be very regrettable that the government be not take action and indeed be reverse some of the safeguard put in place by the previous government to reduce demand again clause be silent on those issue give that represent rural community my third and main concern be that regional commission risk be far detach from local community where there be cheap housing and where there be therefore temptation to far concentrate look after child in way that do not join across the government silos with area such as police funding and housing will give the house specific example because cambridgeshire have have significant population growth but the police funding be base on the population in that be how the police grant be calculate commission do not pick up the additional pressure that the cambridgeshire force be face particularly in its rural community those pressure be exacerbate where we have look after child with troubled history interact with the criminal justice system and where there be challenge around unaccompanied child migrant nothing in this bill say how regional commissioning interplay with the formula for police funding even though the datum have from cambridgeshire police be very clear that significant proportion of their time be spend as consequence of this policy an example of that be the requirement on the police when child go missing which be rightly an issue of significant concern of course that be something for which the police should prioritise time but have concentration of care home in rural community can require significant additional resource clause fail to address supply and demand what will be do about the fact that it be far divorce from the rural community where commission be often place give that the government be hammer rural community in so many area not least farm how will they reassure my constituent in fenland that the failure of the money to follow look after child sufficiently be go to be address will finish with one example from the recent datum come from council the home office reimburse council for their spending on child under at rate of between and day on february this year council report that the payment from central government do not cover all the cost the risk be that rural community which have be hammer by this government on farming and in so many other area will have to pick up the police cost the health service impact and the other impact on public service that come from more distant regional commissioner which be exactly what clause risk do it would be helpful if the minister could say little bit more about that when he come to close the debate rise to support this bill and the government amendment specifically will talk to new clause to on corporate parenting new clause to on kinship and new clause table by the conservatives as former teacher in secondary school in kent believe these measure be overwhelmingly welcome by many of my constituent and also by professional across social work and social care and in the education sector of course the context of the bill and the government amendment be year of cut to many secondary school and social care service in council across the country successive cut have be make to the number of schoolteacher and those support child on the frontline with many child leave in contextual setting that be inappropriate with school constantly have to chase agency for resolution of course we have six conservative education secretaries since revolving door that would make the average attendance officer blush to get to the specific new clause to table by the secretary of state will ensure clear responsibility on corporate parenting welcome the strengthen provision for care leaver include the responsibility place on local authority to support the transition of young people into adulthood and independent living this transition be period of tumult for many young people but our most vulnerable do not have the support of parent to help they manage it welcome the change to the housing act to clarify that care leaver should not be consider intentionally homeless and should be support also support new clause to which provide much great clarity on register provider in my area of medway many young people be place with provider where people have serious contextual safeguarding concern and many of these residency be unregistered unsurprisingly these child end up be involve with the police and with local authority as the environment and management of these home be in some case unscrutinised and poor sadly as chair of the community safety partnership in medway regularly see wave of criminality associate with some of these home therefore welcome the measure to tighten up the audit and scrutiny of they by regulator in addition welcome the debate raise by new clause and elsewhere on kinship care in the uk kinship care play vital role in support child who be unable to live with their birth parent offer they familiar and supportive environment during challenging time there be over child in kinship care in england and wales the benefit of kinship care be significant and child should be offer the same redress as those in foster care child place with relative or close family friend be able to maintain strong emotional bond retain connection to their cultural identity and stay within their local community the clause on which wish the government to go far on be those to support kinship care and urge they to continue to do so work in dialogue with back bench mps charity and third sector organisation lastly on new clause want to talk from my experience as teacher about the effective management of ban mobile phone and the safeguard component specifically link to part as former teacher know this have significant merit with issue of mental health social medium bullying and screen time cause concern which be why welcome the government position of further research in this space however many school already operate policy to this effect include no phone visible policy during the school day and before could support any such proposal would need clarity about the professional distance in relation to any such amendment include what would happen if child be to be find with phone would that lead to an immediate suspension or expulsion and what would happen if mobile phone be conceal be teacher expect to challenge student and try to turn out their pocket because for many professional that would be step too far would need to see real guidance before advise teacher about try to challenge student who may not have visible phone on they but where there be suspicion that they have one there also need to be further consultation work where do we draw the line between mobile phone and tablet device such as an ipad which many child may also bring into school that allow access to social medium be there not conversation to be have with social medium provider and other company about withdraw service for those as oppose to stop they hold the technology especially as we know that much of this be link to out of school activity as well as to in school activity further debate on this topic be need before we simply jump to ban there be many thing that student do in school that we might challenge such as eat food we do not approve of however we have to be careful because digital device and digital literacy be important if child be to grow up into adult who understand the context of the digital device they hold ban can have cobra effect in the sense of not enable child to learn how to manage themselves on these device many of the amendment show the importance of an holistic approach to education the bill and the government amendment acknowledge that academic achievement alone be not sufficient for child success and that agency and social service have broad responsibility to support our most vulnerable part of this bill link holistically to other part which will be discuss tomorrow on free breakfast club cut to school uniform cost and reform of pay and condition urge all member to support these amendment thank you madam deputy speaker for call to speak on this important children wellbeing and schools bill wish to focus my attention on two new clause first be call my new clause sara law after sara sharif my murder constituent this come out of the finding of the recent review conduct by the children commissioner thank the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children and other that have suggest raft of great change to the bill when it come to improve how we look after child in the uk the list be never end with so many great contribution from many give what happen to sara sharif we know that the system be not protect vulnerable child as it should it fail she so be hop to untie that fundamental knot in the child social care system the sad reality be that the level of support child receive too often depend not on their need but on where they live and the threshold the council have for step in and save child from abuse and neglect there be an unacceptable inequality in how local authority interpret threshold for an intervention under section of the children act that mean child at risk in one council area may receive early help and intervention if family be in crisis yet in another they be leave without the intervention that could protect they if not save their life every child in this country have in effect be enter into postcode lottery and we be gamble with their life by not attempt to repair that flaw we need to look at the devastating case of sara to understand the consequence of have system that lack consistency and clear national standard do not think we can put price on child life and decide to step in only on the basis of resource but that be how the current system work it be clear that social service over the year have struggle with deep cut to funding and service and the liberal democrats and be not yet confident that the new government will fully fund local authority sara be just year old when she be brutally murder after sadly year of torture and slavery at the hand of those who be suppose to love she she be know to social service yet the response be not sufficient to protect she would clearer national guidance with strong threshold for intervention have make difference in my opinion yes would automatic referral such as those propose in this new clause have ensure that professional have the opportunity to intervene before it be too late in my view yes new clause call for review of the variation in the support that child in need receive across the country and critically it require the government to establish national standard for when and how child should receive help it set out clear trigger for automatic referral to child social care such as when primary caregiver enter custody or become an in patient for mental healthcare or when child be arrest there be moment of profound instability for child in such case yet without clear national standard and proactive approach too many slip through the crack my constituent sara slip through the crack in january when ask the prime minister if he would call for an inquiry into the failing of the state surround the death of sara he say the government would look into it but we be still wait for he to update the house the propose change would set expectation about how frequently child situation should be review case like sara remind we that it be not enough to assess child once and then step away their need must be update and review regularly the risk can escalate quickly there be warn sign and if regular check be not in place intervention come too late with morbid consequence new clause be about accountability consistency and most importantly protection we can not continue to accept system where child safety depend on geography and resource rather than need think mp from across the house particularly government members have moral duty to protect vulnerable child and there be so many child out there who be still in danger hope new clause be accept if it be not hope the government will consider it in the other place wish to draw the house attention to new clause which have be refer to table by the hon member for lowestoft jess asato it ensure that corporal punishment can not be use as defence in court if it be be use to hide grievous harm to child it be not about prevent parent from reasonably reprimand their child it be about close legal loophole that abuser have regularly use or attempt to use to evade justice we see it in the case of sara whose father urfan seek to use such defence to avoid accountability for the terrible suffering tantamount to torture that be what the judge say that he inflict no child should endure such brutality no perpetrator should be able to hide behind awful outdated legal justification we should standardise child protection in this country and close the loophole that currently exist that abuser can exploit the bill if correctly amend give we the chance to do that let we take that opportunity and protect vulnerable child very powerful indeed rise to speak in support of new clause in my name which have the support of many colleague across the house and organisation include the royal college of paediatrics and child health barnardo the nspcc and the children commissioner for england be grateful to the hon member for twickenham munira wilson and for woking mr forster for their comment in today debate new clause would amend section of the children act to remove the reasonable punishment defence that permit assault and battery on child by parent and carer child in scotland and wales already have the same protection as adult when it come to be hit but we find ourselves in the peculiar situation where child grow up just over the border in england have few right why should they what be the difference between child grow up in berwick upon tweed and child in bonnyrigg scotland and wales be not alone country around the world have already ban physical punishment tajikistan last year become the late and other have also commit to ban there be global recognition that child deserve well indeed as part of the uk commitment to the sustainable development goal we have already pledge to end all violence against child and that include physical punishment in the home the un committee on the rights of the child have state unequivocally that protection from physical punishment be basic human right of child physical punishment be not punishment it be abuse we have wealth of research to draw on from the last year and not single reputable study have find that physical punishment positively impact child development there be no evidence to show that it improve behaviour in child the reality be that physical punishment do not establish in child mind difference between right and wrong it simply evoke fear fear of violence and pain we know that child who be physically punish be at far high risk of experience maltreatment and abuse by parent because over time parent may feel the need to escalate and inflict more and more pain to elicit the same response year old girl tell childline when be young and misbehave my mum give warning and put on the naughty step then when get to five to year old it be tap or little smack but now it can be proper smack or there be one occasion where she pull my hair and fall to the floor and she continuously hit do want to get mum in trouble but can carry on be afraid of she study have also find that physical punishment lead to high level of aggression direct against parent by their child violence beget violence and teach child from young age that violence be an acceptable way of channel stress and frustration have consequence for all of we in society it also have pronounce impact on the child themselves we know from research conduct by the royal college of paediatrics and child health that child who be physically punish be almost three time more likely to experience mental health problem than those who be not we know that physical punishment of child be link to substance misuse antisocial behaviour and slow cognitive development while the majority of parent do not use physical punishment and its use be decline more than one in five year old have still experience it new clause be not about criminalise parent no one want to stop parent from protect their child who be about to reach for hot kettle or cross busy road of the many country that have introduce ban there have be no evidence that it have lead to an increase in prosecution instead change the law be about give parent child and professional clarity while improve the toolbox parent have to positively raise their child new clause remove the ambiguity create by the reasonable punishment defence and will allow child and adult to come forward more readily to report abuse clear legal framework also make it easy for professional like social worker to do their job in the good interest of child new clause will not on its own be able to stop case like sara sharif but it will certainly ensure that the threat of violence many child face will no long be give the pretence of legal cover we can not afford to delay action the nspcc have see threefold increase in the number of child welfare call mention physical punishment in the past couple of year we need to act now to ban physical punishment so we can ensure that child can grow up free from abuse and harm something know be priority for this government and be the purpose of the bill in front of we evidence from other country show we that ban work in germany for example the percentage of young people subject to physical punishment fall from to after it introduce ban in give that of adult believe that physical punishment be unacceptable it seem to that soon or later we will have to change the law my challenge with new clause be why not soon why do we not commit to end this abuse today child will not thank we for wait future generation will not look kindly on our inaction nor should they we have the evidence the power and the time we have the ability to act and we should to protect all our child it be pleasure to join in this important debate as it have be to serve on the bill committee be very pleased that we have two day to debate the bill on report because really it be two bills which be very different in character in part which we be debate today there be great deal on which think all of we in the house agree in fact quite large part of it be in the previous government publish bill it contain some important provision cover child in care special educational need child protection and so on my right hon friend speak with huge level of authority give his previous role he have just mention special educational need as fellow hampshire mp would he agree that we in hampshire benefit from excellent service for our local school particularly when it come to special educational need however demand have double in the past few year would he support my campaign to save the henry cort community college in fareham and waterlooville which be under threat of closure if the college be to be close would it not be well divert to special educational need provision to serve the local community my right hon friend and near constituency neighbour make very important point and be sure she be run very effective campaign we look to the government to come forward with what we know will be large and broad special educational need reform package we do not yet know what will be in it or what the implication will be of course we want all child to be wherever be right for they for some child that mean be educate in mainstream setting where they can benefit from that however we also know that for some child it be right to be in special school have the full range of provision be therefore incredibly important there be great deal in this bill that could speak about and which we do speak about in committee however in pursuit of brevity as know you would wish madam deputy speaker be go to limit myself today to talk about two aspect one thing that be in the bill and another that be conspicuous by its absence the thing that be in the bill be peculiar thing to raise on the floor of the house of commons because it be something with which have not yet hear anybody disagree and on which there be no amendment to speak to although to remain orderly madam deputy speaker can speak with reference to government amendment which be right next to it in the legislation speak neither in favour nor against the principle of what be about to cover but raise it for what be think an important reason in this house it be sometimes precisely with measure on which there be no disagreement that the great danger lie because this house with its oppositional layout thrive on people find hole in what be be propose and object to they when everybody be say the same kind of thing there be real danger that thing will get through without the proper attention have not yet say what be refer to have be refer to the provision on unique identifier couple of speaker have already mention the importance of these measure the hon member for hitchin alistair strathern be talk about number of almost invariably serious case review identify the problem that have occur lot of that centre around the lack of proper datum sharing where different agency both know the same child but do not join together what they know about that child in order to be able to act in their good interest have what be in the system world call an index terrible way to refer to child or unique identifier for every child so that everybody know when they be talk about the same child be very important the chair of the education committee the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes speak about the potential for this area to be genuinely transformational think that be the phrase she use all of that be true clause allow for the creation of single unique identifier for child and introduce new duty around datum sharing here be my worry sometimes when we legislate something pass through without too much debate and then two or three year later all sort of other thing start happen and when we query why they be happen people say well you lot vote for this you pass law about it perhaps these be some of the consequence think something along those line might have happen with gdpr for example and some of the thing that we now see come through on rule around child social medium use and age the creation of the single unique identifier be massive change in the way we keep record on people in this country with the potential to join up different database there be great positive implication for thing like child safety but there be other implication around privacy datum security and so on it have be suggest that the nhs number would be the unique identifier use for each child which at first glance seem an obvious and sensible thing to do as former minister in the department for work and pensions madam deputy speaker you will know that in the past various project have propose use the national insurance number as unique identifier for adult which at the time also seem like sensible and clever thing to do however when it be prod far it turn out that the national insurance number database be not perfect and be afraid the nhs number database may not be either it just be not design for this kind of purpose we be obviously not go to have big debate on this issue today although they may do in the other place when they talk about the bill however over time think we will have to unpack what this whole new system may imply for start be it talk about use the exist nhs database and the index term the unique identifier for individual or be it talk about take those number and put they into new database or system which would have significant cost and time implication if it be use the current nhs database we need to think about the implication there have be different debate go on about ai and the use of large amount of datum for academic research what would be the implication of have this huge database with every child in the country potentially link to all sort of other database with detail about they for that kind of research how secure would the system be we can probably safely say that the system would not give the same number to two different child but be not certain that we could say with total confidence that the same one child could not at different time in their life have different number particularly with immigration and re immigration change in family structure and so on what would that mean for the system more broadly though once we have this unique identifier and national database of this sort we could use it for quite few thing other than child protection some of those thing might be consider by many of we in this house to be pro social thing that be worth pursue we have be have debate about age verification and the use of electronic device and social medium for example such database would probably be the most reliable identity system for what about after age if child have grow up with this database and with number and identifier attach to they that would not disappear just because they pass the age of majority in theory they could carry on have link database that potentially link up child protection source nhs source police national computer and so on who know what else could be join up we might then find that we have system of national identity card without have seek that in the first place the right hon gentleman be raise number of technical consideration about the implementation of project that be no doubt very ambitious but do he not hear the cry from parent of child with send who be so weary of have to tell their story again and again to different part of the system that be suppose to help they and be currently be hamper in those effort by exactly this want for information about child be hold in single place do he not think that ambitious though this project be and important though the technical consideration be it be worth deliver and that it be worth give parent the confidence that we in this house will scrutinise it and do that job there be big gain to be have from pursue this course of action think the hon lady be here for the first two or three minute of my speech that be broadly what say in fact quote she talk about the transformational potential of this measure and its importance do not want to go through it all again but say that when we all agree on something there be sometimes danger of unintended consequence then say that we may not talk about all this today we do not have to do so today but think the government will probably have to come back multiple time for parliament to be able to consider all the much wide potential implication of create such database think not for the first time in our in our life we be not million mile away from one another the other thing that want to talk about in less consensual tone be what be glare in its absence from the bill new clause on mobile phone and social medium table by my right hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott there be four part to it the first two state that the chief medical officer should be commission to issue report and the government will conduct research on the effect of social medium on child and young people that be in the bill introduce by the hon member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister which we discuss couple of fridays ago the third thing be in the wide package as colleague will remember but the government do not agree to it phone ban during the school day that be point of contention although know that many hon member across the house include in the labour party agree on it there be limit to the approach an argument that be always make when ask why not ban mobile phone at school be what about out of school that be good question but it be not reason not to do the first part readily admit that most online harm happen outside school we know from research include the recent study from the university of birmingham that school ban do not necessarily reduce the total amount of time that young people spend online it just displace some of it that do not necessarily improve thing such as sleep which be big worry for teenager nor do it address wide issue of attention span eyesight and so on rule be still important for the sake of both child and school but three thing in recent year have change the context for behaviour in school the first be set of thing that happen around covid sort of attitude shift that seem to have happen to large extent throughout society the other two thing be vape and phone of course there be universal ban on vape at school that do not mean that they never get through but pupil be not allow to vape in any state secondary school in this country phone be the other thing we know say that because it apply to we as well that if we have phone in our pocket even if we be not look at the screen in front of we it be still something of distraction because it could buzz at any time in fact we might be wonder if it will buzz when someone reply or comment on post or whatever it might be the school day in its entirety should be devote to school that mean not just lesson and learn thing although that be the primary aim but be child or young person be with friend and grow up without those distraction do the right hon gentleman say that it be rite of passage for young people as young as year and to have mobile phone and that it be in the gift of their parent to decide last year do he not suggest that we should wait until the guidance give by government be fully review and understand before we go for an outright ban why have he change his mind do not know if the hon member have be read again but do not say what he just suggest think he be probably refer to an interview from year ago in which say that it have become something of rite of passage that between year and the great majority of child be give mobile phone that be true and it be not at all what he just say that say on point of be read from mobile phone but talk about quote they be important for research on february when the right hon gentleman be the minister of state for schools press release issue his department say mobile phone be set to be prohibit in school across england on the right hon member website on february there be an article that say this late article by the right hon gentleman for the herald and post follow the decision to ban mobile phone in school raise that point because previously conservative members make the argument that they be already ban mobile phone in school be it not the case that they be posture then just as they be posture now the hon member clearly do not consult the hon member for chatham and aylesford tristan osborne because he have make slightly contradictory point be come on to say that we do issue non statutory guidance that mobile phone should be prohibit during school that be the right thing to do do not know if this be far down whatever webpage the hon member for basingstoke luke murphy be look at but say that we maintain the option of make that guidance statutory that time have come to do that because the guidance have not be sufficiently effective in its current form but issue the guidance be the right thing to do it be not just any website it be the right hon member website and it be direct quote my point it be not necessarily to do with the point make by my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford tristan osborne be that when the right hon gentleman be minister of state for schools he describe the move on his website as an outright ban no if no but it be describe by the previous government as an outright ban it be posture then and it be posture now no it be not posture then and it be not posture now we issue non statutory guidance which you describe as ban with respect there be different level there be non statutory guidance statutory guidance and primary legislation first have to deal with this question in on that occasion we decide not to issue ban we have big discussion about it in legislative committee be not totally sure that it be the right approach to take at the time but it seem to be the view of headteacher in particular that there should be no ban the hon member be right that when be back in the department for education we introduce non statutory guidance and believe that the time have come to write that guidance into legislation if he will give chance will say why even if something should be ban it be perfectly legitimate to ask why not just let school decide school know their pupil well have make that argument myself many time over the year on many different thing both the labour party and the conservatives find ourselves in the exceptionalism territory labour members of parliament say do tell school what to do leave it up to individual headteacher have they read the rest of the bill it prescribe what school must do in the most extraordinary detail it take away academy freedom specify the exact length of breakfast and say you may not have more than four item of brand school uniform for secondary school that include tie primary school may not have tie it include all manner of detailed specification except on this one issue to give the mirror image it be true that we believe in general that we should leave thing entirely up to school who know their child good but this should be an exception as that hon gentleman be just be not be rude mean the hon member for basingstoke as oppose to this one the hon member for chatham and aylesford in we decide not to issue that guidance but in we do it be clear at the time that there be an option to make the guidance statutory if require since then the world have keep on change my hon friend the member for harborough oadby and wigston neil talk about the continued development tragically of mental ill health among child and young people we have this debate when discuss private member bill couple of fridays ago prove causality perfectly be incredibly difficult we will probably never be able to do it however do not know about colleague but do not meet many people particularly not teacher who seriously doubt that there be major causal link between the two thing my right hon friend who have detailed experience in the department be speak as eloquently as ever on this topic before we move on from the government members intervention be he like enjoy the slight irony of hear they argue for consistency when on inheritance tax for farmer the women against state pension inequality campaign winter fuel national insurance and so many other issue consistency do not seem to be priority as ever my right hon friend make compelling point madam deputy speaker you will be pleased to know that be come to close the right hon member know where stand and my view on this issue will he outline what have change since february when he say no to ban on phone in school but reserve the right to issue statutory guidance order gently suggest to right hon and hon member that we be mean to be debate the children wellbeing and schools bill on report and the amendment and new clause apologise madam deputy speaker indeed we be in fairness to the hon lady there be connection but it be important to say that we do not say no to ban in we say that we would start with non statutory guidance with the option to make that guidance statutory yes child usage of mobile phone have continue people say phone be ban in all school anyway that be true and doubt there be school in the whole country that say yeah it okay just whip out your phone in the middle of an english lesson everybody have various restriction however if we look at the survey datum we see that there be bit of hierarchy we can listen to ministers headteacher classroom teacher or kid the further down that list we go the more we hear people say phone be about particularly in break and at lunch time that to be part of the school day this be not just about lesson time on friday visit kent college in my constituency which have recently institute ban phone be collect in the morning and put into pouch and at the end of the school day the child can get they back the school have find benefit for the collection of lose property which be attach to the cage that have the phone in they be the right hon member aware of any case where school have institute ban and it have be see to have negative rather than positive outcome the hon member make powerful point very effectively there will always be argument about need exception for this case and that but we can have exception and school headteacher be pretty good at know when they need to make an exception to rule it would be helpful to have national policy in this area that would not preclude exception for child with special educational need or young carer crucially it would also not preclude child from have phone as they go to and from school where the school and the parent want that parent often think about that for safety reason there be various way of deal with this such as the pouch that the hon member mention or locker have notice shift couple of year ago some people argue against ban on principle now the only real argument that hear do not say that this be trivial point be about the big cost of buy pouch or locker if that be what we be argue about that be material progress it be time for we to stop talk about whether and to start talk about how madam deputy speaker may through you wish all member of the house very happy st patrick day rise to speak on new clause what it propose be not brain surgery and it be not new or exciting but it be an essential part of how we approach the enormous problem of child live in temporary accommodation mile away from their home their home borough their school and their doctor the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston neil who speak for the opposition say that he think we would look back at the issue of mobile phone in school and think what be we think to allow that to happen we should already be think how do we come to have ten of thousand of child in temporary accommodation which be almost exclusively in terrible state of repair mile away from anybody who be watch they many of the family we be talk about be not just homeless but be the most vulnerable in our community they include child with special need and child and family who experience great difficulty in their day to day life there be those who have disrupt family those who move frequently and those who just find thing difficult as of right now there be child live in temporary accommodation on average child from homeless family be place in temporary accommodation every day in london the area that understand well one in every child be live in temporary accommodation that be at least one in every school class in school in central london or of child could be live in temporary accommodation that be certainly the case for harris peckham last year an article in the sunday times identify it as have of its child in temporary accommodation that school like all school in the harris federation try to do its good for those large number it have set up drop in centre in the school to allow parent to take their child to school spend the day in school and go home with their child in the evening we constituency mps probably understand lot more clearly than most in our community the impact of what be go on in merton we have just under family in temporary accommodation that be probably the low number in london but to it be an extraordinary number that worry about every day every night and at every advice surgery some of those family be place outside the borough when they be place somewhere outside the borough the council be require to place only two notification one with the receiving borough and one with the ministry of housing communities and local government it do not have to inform the school or the gp and nothing happen so all these borough be take on family that they know nothing of family often do not want their gp to know that they have move because they worry about be remove from their list they worry that that would mean their child be remove from the child and adolescent mental health service list which we know can be as long as month be remove from operation list at local general hospital and generally be displace along with be misplace in accommodation this also mean we probably consider this far less that the health visitor do not know that family with young child have move into the area have great friend debbie fawcett queen nurse who be the homelessness health visitor to family in merton part of her job be to regularly go to hostel convert warehouse and convert office block in and around my constituency to find out where these child be she get no notification she simply walk round the block and get the family she already know to be her spy in order to find out if family be move in she have be know to run into flat after delivery driver to see if she could find baby these family be often place in accommodation that be so small that the child can not learn to walk they be displace from the support of grandparent church and other community group they desperately need debbie help but she do not know they be there many school as we all know provide support far beyond education they provide help with food with uniform and with guidance to family in difficult time at the moment those school do not know that those family be in temporary accommodation there be also shame attach to be homeless and in temporary accommodation so parent often do not want to tell the school they often struggle heroically to get their child to school know of many family who bring their child from luton into mitcham and morden to keep the continuity in their schooling they fear that if they tell the school the school will remove they from their list one of the most shocking thing that happen be that child with very high need who receive special school transport to get to special school that support child with great many difficulty have their transport cancel when they be move out of the borough their family then have to negotiate with council they do not know to see if they can get that transport back there have to be well way there have to be well notification that will not sort the problem of temporary accommodation but it could just protect those family protect council and protect we against huge and terrible thing happen in this bill we rightly talk at length about child who be home school but let say that live in temporary accommodation must be at least as risky as be home school through the brilliant work of dr laura neilson gp in oldham we know the terrible fact that child die in temporary accommodation over five year where the coroner say that temporary accommodation be major factor we also know that of those child be under the age of one and die from sudden death syndrome probably because they do not even have cot of their own there be far more child who die while live in temporary accommodation but we can not make that causal link that it be the main reason for their death we know that child in one year or of the total number of child who die that year be live in temporary accommodation how be it that we be not tell gps and school that this be happen to the family and the child under their care do not believe it be beyond the wit of the government to be able to rectify this all council should be send notice to receive borough be not claim for single second that all council do this know they do not and that be problem in itself and all council do because the money depend on it send notification to the department for housing communities and local government we be talk about really expensive service here in london we spend million every day put these family in temporary accommodation be sure most member who have see this accommodation will know that it be terrible waste of taxpayer money but we need to ensure that it be spend properly and safely and that people know where the family be live and that they get whatever support they can know that the government feel unable to accept the amendment at this time but hope they understand the spirit in which it be lay down and the importance that the all party parliamentary group for household in temporary accommodation attache to these recording factor be pleased that the minister have agree that she and the other departments will look at this in timely fashion because we can not wait something terrible may well happen and do not want to feel that it be on my conscience or any of our conscience that we could have do something to prevent it from happen fully appreciate that the only way this problem will really be sort be by build more house but one important small step be to ensure that the school attend by homeless child know that those child be in temporary accommodation and that their gps and their health visitor also know rise to speak in support of amendment table by my party and then will say few word to lend cross party support to new clause and truly welcome the important step take in the bill to strengthen the system intend to keep child safe yet the bill fail to embed meaningful consideration of child view this mean that critical decision may be make at local and regional level without consideration of the view and experience of the child they affect it be concern that the propose requirement in the bill be to seek the view of the child only where the local authority think that be appropriate the nspcc point out that this be weak than the exist children act requirement to ascertain and give due weight to the wish and feeling of the child in line with their age and maturity in short while there be so many good thing in the bill it inexplicably fall short of that gold standard our amendment seek to address that amendment would ensure that local authority offer and facilitate family group decision making must consistently seek to ascertain the child view and to properly support they to engage where this be in their good interest importantly the amendment also seek to ensure that where attendance at family group decision making meeting may not be in the child interest which must of course include give due weight to their wish and feeling and identify safeguard concern that be not the end of the story because even if the child be not in attendance the amendment require the local authority to ensure that the child view be seek and where relevant independently represent this could be for example through an independent advocate recognise the incredible work they do to support even the young child to be hear and to participate where possible so hope the minister will look seriously at that amendment new clause be table by the hon member for lowestoft jess asato thank she for her year of work on this issue and want to reiterate that the green party support put into law equal protection for child the physical assault of child be never acceptable and we need to follow scotland and wales by urgently update our law the children commissioner the nspcc the royal college of paediatrics and child health and many other have be crystal clear not least in the wake of the horrifying case of sara sharif that child should be equally protect from assault the children commissioner make the important point that equal protection from physical assault be not so call smacking ban that term trivialise this issue and be misleading about the type of behaviour that would come under scrutiny through such legislation wrongly imply the creation of new offence equal protection would instead remove the defence currently available to parent and carer who have be charge with assault which by their nature be some of the most serious case of child maltreatment will also say few word in support of new clause table by the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes who chair the education committee there be strong cross party support for requirement for the secretary of state to consult on and publish draft national care offer to set minimum standard for local care offer indeed my hon friend the member for north herefordshire ellie chowns table similar amendment in committee she be unfortunately unable to speak in today debate as she be on environmental audit committee business all local authority as we have hear have to produce local offer for care leaver but the support they get be postcode lottery great national offer would help support independent live into adulthood for all care leaver enhance and improve support for all care leaver would involve an ambitious cross government programme of work but it would mean that for the first time there could be clear list of statutory entitlement that care leaver could access such entitlement should mirror the support that many young people receive from their parent include support with rent deposit or free transport with the number of child in care at record high we simply must do more to support those leave care there be both financial and moral case for the government to do that rise to comment on government new clause to and new clause very much welcome the new corporate parenting duty and the value they add to the bill and to the activity of authority up and down the country the new clause add value because this bill be about boost standard in school and create opportunity it be about child get the good start in life and ensure that there be clear protection for young people crucially it be about stop child and young people from fall through the crack in the system in addition to the unique identifier that this debate have consider to join up service to help child and young people the overhaul of child social care which be long overdue start by cap excess profit ensure collaboration and ensure that every pound count towards get the good for child and the measure to support kinship carer and care leaver elsewhere in the bill all of which be crucial it be also crucial to strengthen what child in care can expect authority to do to secure good outcome for they previously lead child service as cabinet member in southampton that be during time when we need to make huge stride forward to improve how we support child and young people know from that experience what rest on the service provide they make or break opportunity for the young people look to we for care it be welcome that the bill now include accommodation in the local offer which make good on commitment to guarantee care leaver place to live new clause set out the wide responsibility for authority the reality be that the barrier face by care experienced young people be great than those face by most of their peer and good outcome will likely be far hard for they to secure it be right that authority do more in good sensible collaboration but what do that look like it be couch in unfortunate language in sense parent be word that pretty much everyone can relate to and we understand corporate but not in this context we know within the sector what corporate parenting mean but it potentially draw away from how we should be think about it in term of family rather than an institution public service or organisation with threshold and goal that mean family give love and attention to those in its care it ensure warm safe place to live echo the comment of my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh it be about get they in front of doctor or dentist precisely when they need it we know that the support do not stop when kid leave home as father of teenager and small one have not yet face the moment when they leave home but know that if and when they eventually leave will not suddenly say you someone else issue now therefore corporate parent can not and must not do the same when kid leave home parent continue to help they out if for example that family have family business they give first dibs on job or training opportunity to their child that be what council do as corporate parent they act as guarantor and can help with university or apprenticeship cost in short they fight for those young people and act as one family they do not pass the buck and say it not my problem and that be what corporate parenting must be about across all government organisation and other authority have work closely with young people in care know that far too many of they feel that they have be let down by system that be there to protect they they often fall through the crack while new clause be not magic wand it be another important step in the right direction it say that this government get it that we understand what care experienced young people face for too many of they that look like constantly move from house to house from placement to placement it look like school change often lack of housing or certainly lack of appropriate housing when leave care and different part of the system not talk to each other this addition to the bill would act to change that experience for the well and make that journey through care into adulthood as support as possible ask ministers to comment on how they see good practice on corporate parenting be promote in the statutory guidance look forward to more join up child focus work across all agency as result of this addition to the bill finally will comment on new clause table by my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes this issue come up in committee speak in support of the principle of national care leaver offer be pleased to see this proposal in committee accept and support the intention of the minister to drive forward strong cross departmental collaboration to support care experienced young people know that minister have listen and introduce provision on corporate parenting you live and learn in this place so figure that there be no harm in press ministers again to perhaps do the same on the national care leaver offer whatever shape the bill go forward in there be enough in it to make it real moment of progress and pride when we vote for third reading call on hon member across the house to do that on second reading speak about the role of support lodging but also speak about the impact on well mean and responsible parent who for variety of reason choose to home educate their child and who will be disproportionately impact by the legislation realise that this issue be in part of the bill and will be debate tomorrow but be on public bill committee tomorrow so want to get on the record my support for amendment to table by the conservative education team which all seek to tackle the hammer blow that the bill apply to home educate family however today must stick to part appreciate that be speak slightly off topic clause and seek to far support those who have be in the care system by provide statutory basis for their support to the age of like the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey as former member of corporate parenting panel as councillor over the year have meet many young people who be look for support and security as they start their transition to adulthood should at this point declare an interest as member of plymouth city council want to share recent innovation by the council we have great history of cross party work as corporate parenting panel but the council have just institute pay for prescription and provide additional housing support for over the particularly clever point be that it charge the cost of the prescription back to the integrate care board so that be good illustration of what be go on out there and be the sort of thing we could build on indeed when be member of corporate parenting panel feel strongly that good way to get national recognition and national provision as the hon member for southampton itchen say would be to pursue something like care leaver covenant bit like the veteran covenant this be not over the top we have touch the edge of the expectation around job housing and homelessness and the implication and understanding of the veteran covenant could be extend to care leaver as say have meet many care leaver who be look for that support as result have particular interest in the transition to adulthood we can stand here and talk about young people from birth to but something about the transition to adulthood have always resonate with it be particularly important that be able to speak about that again today specifically welcome the government confirmation in committee that support lodging will be include in the bill statutory guidance as form of accommodation to be consider by local authority have highlight the value of support lodging to young people on second reading and have see the evidence that home for good and safe families provide in committee remain convinced that they be valuable option for young people and should be use more furthermore know the fostering network be keen to see the bill proceed and more explicitly provide for stay put not just stay close thereby extend the opportunity for young people to remain with their foster carer at the age of ultimately that would be one less move they need to make if they do not have secure home after that age however be not sure that be in the final bill it remain to be see suppose the house of lords could make an amendment but we will have to see where we end up it be disappointing that amendment table by my right hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott do not have government support it would have ensure that stay close support take account of the view of young people require local authority to take account of the wish of the relevant young person when provide stay close support to allow for continuous improvement it would also have introduce requirement to keep record of those wish to ensure that the young person view and desire be protect from the loss of knowledge when personnel change we have already hear about many inconsistency in the bill and this feel like another we be keen for young people to have number that follow they all the way through school but we be not keen to ensure that their record and their wish as care experience young people be follow through and protect as be sure many member will agree it be all well and good for we to stand here today and say that support lodging should be promote but as someone who have not be in the care system can speak only from the experience of receive my family continue support after the age of however also have choice at that stage and it be so important that as corporate parent we ensure such choice continue my life be effectively base on my choice which mean go away to university but also get to come home every holiday although may have lose my bedroom to my young brother still have home right through until move to london for my first job even move back again in my early have the support of home which we be say we should provide for those who be care experienced it be essential that we recognise the value of choice for those care experienced young people who do not have the choice we may have if we can at least listen to they and ensure that their view and preference be carry through the system put they in the drive seat it would be beneficial to their transition to adulthood clause strengthen the provision of advice and support for young people age to who have be in the care system while welcome the extension to the expectation of who local authority support and how it feel like limited list this seem like miss opportunity bear with madam deputy speaker because this be reasonably long story that do not directly relate to these amendment until the end but think it be important to put it on the record on friday year old man attend my surgery to share his experience as someone who have be place in care and then adopt unfortunately this bill do not cover his experience he be sexually abuse as baby by both his parent and he be eventually remove from home with hindsight he be also neglect the impact of his life story mean that he have experience homelessness prison on more than one occasion and ongoing mental health issue relate to the trauma he experience these issue extend into his adoptive life with new mother who become an alcoholic and be physically abusive towards he now young man despite the odd stack against he he have settle down have three child and be still with their mother although he say that be tough at time he be facilitator for andy man club in my constituency and he have set up support group and podcast to help other like he on the one hand he be success however he highlight an issue that think be important to raise today he clearly articulate to how he feel he be let down by social service when he ask to see his care record this be where believe his story link to the bill regardless of the fact that he discover there be two set of record his social service file and his adoption record he receive no support when he make request to access they he be simply give the file by devon county council and that be that have read two of the five file he be give which he find to be in highly disorganised state he have to stop because of their content significant adverse effect on he his case highlight the need for provision like clause to go far on the stay close offer by prompt conversation about how we support those who have through no fault of their own experience some of the most horrific early childhood experience how can we well support previously look after adult as they continue their journey through life appreciate that we can not necessarily provide this support forever but perhaps the only thing we need to do when they access their social service record as we do not know at what point in their life they will do so be ensure that they receive meeting with someone train to explain what those record mean that be what young adult like my constituent be request my constituent record contain distressing detail but they also include lot of technical language that he do not understand because he be not social worker he may be over now but do not believe his experience be age relate call on the minister to ensure that guidance on the sharing of care record be explore as we finalise clause this simple proposal could make an extraordinary difference the hon lady be make powerful point about the importance of access coherent and organise record however do she agree that one of the reason for those record be disorganise be the churn of social worker and one of the cause of that churn be our care system extensive reliance on the excessive profiteering of external company this bill provide for retention of care worker by rule out excessive profiteering do she welcome that will reserve my judgment because be not convinced that strip out excessive profiteering will actually help the system ultimately what we need be the provision of service if people just leave the sector altogether we will not have social worker anyway do not agree with the hon gentleman on that point but understand the link to what be say welcome how far we have come in recent year on extend support in area such as housing and provision up to the age of but believe the bill be create another cliff edge what more can be do to enable those affect in adulthood by the emotional and mental impact of their life in care to access train support that might be something we need to consider far slightly change tack and talk of miss opportunity and perhaps lack of ambition fail to see why the government can not support safeguard young people in school by ban mobile phone in the classroom feel there be another inconsistency here as my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds mention clause limit the use of brand school uniform to reduce peer pressure and cost the hon member for chatham and aylesford tristan osborne who be no long in his place make that argument while at the same time argue for ensure that young people can take their smartphone and their tablet into school talk about something that create peer pressure and highlight the disparity between those who can afford it and those who can not simply believe the government do not want to support the amendment because it be table by conservative front benchers we need to move away from party politic and seriously consider what be good for young people we should at least be consistent let we make sure that the legislation we be create do not do one thing on the one hand and something completely different on the other new clause be not about ban young people from use phone do not believe that be the state role it be for parent to choose if and when their child can use phone instead it be about recognise the impact that the presence of phone can have before during and immediately after the school day there be some parent who recognise that there be those who limit what their child can access on their smartphone and those who be make the most of what some might refer to as brick phone do not know whether any of we here this afternoon ever have one of those or as it be know today dumb phone or non smartphone some parent be now choose to go back in time by give their child really simple phone which still enable they to call on the way home or should they be young carer to have phone in school with they that remove all the peer pressure and to be perfectly frank the difficulty that lot of parent face in have to say no to all the demand do not have child but have friend who do and they be in that difficult to year old age group the big fight they have be over what their child can access on their phone if we make have smartphone less appealing in the first place we would be do huge amount to help parent to do their difficult job in these modern time do not believe our new clause would hinder anything instead it would protect child in school and promote focus and attention as have say it would also limit the peer pressure on child and their parent for fully smartphone world finally the government have also fail to grasp the role that the bill could have play in strengthen safeguard and support for family experience domestic abuse cross party we have come long way in how we deal with domestic abuse case in this country and the legislation have be massively progressive over the last few year particularly welcome how the previous government work to recognise child as victim in their own right in domestic abuse case however the safeguard provision in the bill could have go far and be use as an opportunity to do more to provide explicitly for child who experience male violence we know that child be either victim themselves or be severely impact by witness violence or coercion in the home have mention this before but group work to tackle violence against woman and girl and sexual violence in my home city of plymouth be look to move the language we use away from violence against woman and girl and towards violence against woman and child specifically to recognise that threat and the need to do more in look after child perhaps this bill could have provide an opportunity to do that however we will have to leave that for another day in conclusion this be the most underwhelming and unambitious bill for school in history not my word but those of caroline teacher of year experience as the debate move to part of the bill tomorrow hope there may be glimpse of something bright however probably pretty much like she remain unconvinced refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests rise to speak to new clause to stand in my name and those of my hon friend new clause be yet another attempt to put my healthy start bill into law when first introduce that bill eligible pregnant woman baby and infant be miss out on healthy start voucher that be approximately million go unclaimed from scheme that be already budget for these voucher provide financial assistance in the form of prepaid card to all who be pregnant family with baby and child under the age of five and pregnant woman claim certain benefit this be to help with the ever increase cost of fruit and vegetable milk formula and vitamin just last year the child of the north all party parliamentary group which chair hear evidence that child in the north be more likely to die before reach their first birthday than those anywhere else in the country it have be widely report for some time that in desperation parent have resort to the theft of baby milk and formula or to have to water it down which be not surprising consider that formula price be at historically high level as it stand there be lack of awareness about the scheme and the application route be overly complex and varied the reason so many be miss out on voucher be that the system operate on an opt in not an opt out model auto enrolment for all those eligible would ensure maximum take up of this essential nutritional safety net the healthy start scheme be introduce by labour government the current problem with it be the fault of the last government management of the scheme it be in this government gift to solve those problem new clause relate to improve sible contact for child in care the children act require local authority to allow look after child reasonable contact with their parent but there be no parity of provision for look after child contact with their sibling or half sibling if sibling can not be place together they should have exactly the same right to contact define in primary legislation as they do with their parent the relationship that adult deem to be the most important for child in care be not the same as those that be most important to the child themselves the government own research acknowledge that maintain contact with sibling be report by child to be one of their high priority have that relationship rip away cause they anguish on many level although the department do not collect statistic on sibling contact level work by the family rights group have show that half of all sible group in local authority care be split up many of those sibling come from neglectful and abusive background they state themselves that the only constant positive reassuring and endure relationship be the one they have with their sibling that be especially the case if they have be abuse by their parent therefore it can not be right that our primary legislation give more weight to child contact with those who have or may have cause they significant harm than it give to contact with their sibling who be totally blameless guidance on sible contact do exist but it be sufficiently opaque to be ignore and it regularly be we all know in this house that guidance be no substitute for clear duty first raise the issue in every minister who follow there be lot of they promise that the regulation would be amend to date they have not be amend to date child in care do not have contact with their sibling prioritise this be rob they of what they cite as their most important and endure relationship new clause seek to rectify clear inconsistency in the law whereby child in stable foster placement can stay with their foster family until the age of under the term of the staying put arrangement but similar provision do not exist for child in residential care we should not be preside over two tier system where those in foster care receive more comprehensive support from the state than those in residential care the minister know that child in residential care often have complex need and require an immense amount of support that need for support continue when they leave care one of the factor know to give they well chance in life be suitable and stable accommodation stay close be not enough local authority have duty to ensure significant accommodation for look after child in their area new clause would introduce similar duty to ensure sufficient accommodation for all care leaver up to the age of not just those in foster care turn to new clause and just as child leave residential care be treat differently from their peer in foster care child age to in residential care be also treat very differently from their young peer in the previous government introduce provision through statutory instrument to prohibit unregulated accommodation for child in care age or under but not for those age or later in they introduce what they deem appropriate standard for supported accommodation for child in care and care leaver these statutory instrument legitimise and encourage the increasingly shameful practice of place child in unregulated unsafe hostel bed and breakfast share home and caravan park some child be even place in tent on campsite all those setting have leave they without any support vulnerable to criminal abuser drug gang and sexual exploitation the change that follow in to support accommodation for child age and include no requirement to provide these child in care with any care at all no requirement for qualified staff or manager to be present in their accommodation and no requirement for independent monthly monitoring of that accommodation ofsted be only require on three yearly cycle to look at small proportion of these accommodation they also do not prohibit corporal punishment as be the case in child residential home and these change still allow put child into care in caravans barge and boat or accommodation with vulnerable adult and prison leaver as of march the late statistic that have be that up to of and year old in care be live in this careless bleak accommodation have say before in this house that child in unregulated accommodation have die that we know of the detail of which be rightly not fully know or in the public domain but the child themselves have speak to have say they be literally survive they be not live they be not be allow to prepare for adulthood they be not in education and they be not in employment they be literally survive hour by hour remain deeply sadden that we do not object to these change at the time despite my effort our and year old in care have be abandon for far too long my new clause and will give they the support and care that they so desperately need and desperately want the support and care that the previous government rip away from they while have be in this place long enough to know that the minister be not go to accept all of my new clause today remain ever confident and hopeful that he will work with and consider these new clause deeply and carefully as the bill progress to the other place and eventually return back to this chamber as the son of lady from limerick may offer my mum my wide family and everybody in the house happy st patrick day rise to speak in support of two new clause new clause table by my hon friend the member for south devon caroline voaden request review of adoption support service offer by local authority and require the government within month of pass the act to conduct review of the adequacy and effectiveness of those service this will give those provide adoption service and those receive they the comfort to know that they be indeed adequate and hopefully increase the confidence in adoption service and increase the take up of those offer their home to child in need on the second amendment wish to speak to declare an interest as member of the all party parliamentary group on household in temporary accommodation new clause table by the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh have the support of colleague from both the labour and liberal democrats benches it require local authority to notify the child school and register gp practice of household homelessness status in this debate we hear from the hon member about the impact of live in temporary accommodation but this new clause will help in detect any learning or health outcome issue as result of live in temporary accommodation accommodation that the chair of our levelling up housing and communities committee have mention in this place before as be no long sadly that temporary it be to be hop too that it will help in learn the lesson of the child who have die in temporary accommodation and that be class as contributory factor to their death commend both these new clause to the house as former teacher know at first hand the importance of safeguard and ensure that every child have the opportunity to thrive regardless of their background or circumstance that be why wholeheartedly welcome and want to talk about new clause to focus on corporate parenting they represent vital step in protect vulnerable child and enhance their overall wellbeing these amendment shift the responsibility for the welfare of child particularly those in care or at risk from be solely single agency duty to much need collective duty on local authority social service healthcare provider and educational agency my hon friend the members for hitchin alistair strathern and for southampton itchen darren paffey eloquently speak about that give example from role that they hold before come to this place the idea of corporate parenting be that service and agency must come together to act in the good interest of child much as parent would they be task with ensure that child receive the care protection and opportunity that they need to grow thrive and reach their full potential as teacher see at first hand how crucial it be for agency to work together child welfare need be not confine to those that arise in the classroom we need to provide they with holistic support system that address their physical emotional and psychological need these new clause will strengthen the bill and create an integrated approach in which service collaborate and share vital information to support child that will reduce duplication of work minimise silo work and ensure that child be not ignore when it come to access mental health service education housing and medical care no child should fall through the crack every child deserve to have their need meet and this bill will ensure that all agency involve be jointly responsible for make that happen this landmark reform to child safeguarding mean no more empty word about lesson to be learn instead we have real action and government who be take responsibility the need for these change be clear we have see far too often the tragic consequence of system fail to collaborate or act quickly enough case such as that of victoria climbié young girl who suffer horrifically at the hand of her guardian despite be in contact with multiple child protection agency highlight the devastating outcome of such failure similarly the case of baby or peter connelly be heart wrench reminder that even child who be know to authority can fall victim to abuse when system do not work as they should the hon member for woking mr forster speak about his constituent sara sharif sadly these be just few of the tragedy that should never have happen while we can not change the past we can and must ensure that we never allow such failure to happen again new clause to aim to prevent more child from be let down by the system by make local authority and agency more accountable the bill ensure that there be shared responsibility for every child it be about create proactive rather than reactive system of child protection like my hon friend the member for southampton itchen would welcome example of good practice in corporate care and for the government to explore this issue we all know that child who have the support that they need be more likely to succeed have witness small intervention whether from teacher social worker or healthcare professional make world of difference to child life join up these sometimes small but often life change intervention can only enhance they the new clause be about ensure that such intervention be not isolate but be part of large picture so that there be co ordinate effort to meet the need of every child especially the most vulnerable thank all member for their passionate and informed speech today particularly those from labour members as my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh say we see the concern and plight of the child in our constituency at first hand in conclusion the children wellbeing and schools bill mark significant shift in how we safeguard child the holistic co ordinate approach outline in the bill particularly in clause to offer the good chance in year to create safe and more supportive environment for our child now be our opportunity to build system in which every child be truly protect and give the support that they deserve vote against the bill be vote against the safety of our child their childhood and their future it would mean more word and inaction and would shamefully allow child to continue to slip through the crack and be let down urge all hon member to use their vote to pass this landmark reform and safeguard all child so that they not only survive but thrive rise to speak in favour of new clause and amendment both in my name as well as the amendment table by my hon friend the member for twickenham munira wilson the corporate parenting forum be one of the more enjoyable committee be on when be local councillor agree with the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey that the forum have quite cold name give all the warm work that it do it show the dedication of social worker the compassion of foster carer and adoptive parent and the resilience and character of the child however anyone involve in that forum would also have see that the hard work of those involve be often undermine by system that hold people back from care to the good of their ability be pleased that the bill will make significant progress in that regard however there be area where it could go far and intend to speak about couple of they one area of particular interest to be the so call care cliff edge those leave the care system at be force to grow up so much fast than their peer have raise the issue on the floor of the house before in particular the age differential for universal credit that impact young care leaver far more than any other group the bill seek to lessen the care cliff edge the stay close support requirement be of particular of interest to as be strengthen the support provide up to the age of however there be an anomaly on housing understand that the government may accept that care leaver should not be regard as become homeless intentionally but my new clause would go step far and extend priority need status under the homelessness legislation to all care leaver up to the age of regardless of all assess vulnerability the bill provide that status to young care leaver aged to but that be out of line with the rest of the support available to young care leaver give all we know about the vulnerability of care leaver which have be speak about in the chamber today we should not put they in position where they have to prove their vulnerability at that crucial crisis point last friday be at homeless shelter in my constituency meet young carer who have spend eight month in tent prior to arrive at the shelter he tell the story of how that happen he have be in support accommodation before the age of but that home shut down just as he reach the age of so his transition plan be completely undermine in moment he bounce about from place to place for the following few year he have now reach the crucial age of but he have not receive the support he need in the last few year new clause could help rescue people like he in the future my other area of interest be kinship care must admit that have not hear of kinship care until few year ago but grow up in kinship care be the eld of three boy my mum have at and time get pretty tough as teenager thing boil over and eventually the relationship with my parent break down leave home and never go back as cocky as be at or year old could not have live on my own but luckily my grandparent step up to take on my nan and pops as know they help pick up the piece and put back on the straight and narrow go from be boy who have start to fall behind in school and drink bit down the park to slowly take my education more seriously and get my act together if it have not be for my grandparent be pretty sure that would not be sit on these green benches today it be not easy for they though they be on state pension live in council house and do not have lot to give but what they do have to give be love guidance and support crucially that be accept readily by because they already have my trust and respect and they have authority over because they be my grandparent that be the real power of keep care within the family there be bond that be ready make which be difficult to replicate in any other form of care and they provide the foundation that child need to thrive acknowledge that the bill be groundbreake on kinship care but we have so few opportunity to make change in this area and be determined to get it right the very first time my hon friend the member for twickenham have table amendment on kinship care leave kinship allowance extend the pupil premium and prioritise school admission arrangement all of which have put my name to strongly hope that the government can find way to support those amendment have also table amendment which would ensure that kinship family be actively engage in shape and form the local authority policy that be outline in the legislation as family be in develop policy for child with special educational need the simple principle be nothing about we without we kinship be particularly complex form of care the relationship have history we need to appreciate the special nuance and listen to kinship carer when develop policy we must ensure that the authority hear the voice of kinship family when design the system to support they wish that my grandparent have live long enough to see take my place on these benches they would have be very proud hope today that we can begin to say thank you to they and to the thousand of kinship carer like they by work towards the strong possible right and support we have hear some superb speech this afternoon the chair of the education committee the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes give brilliant and thoughtful speech which end with she talk about the welfare reform that the government will propose tomorrow our proposal for ban on smartphone in school be part of general drive to undo the damage that smartphone childhood be do to young people mental health we see that the driver of ballooning welfare claim which the government be really worried about be young people and their mental health claim if we want to be serious about prevention good place to start be with the amendment that we will vote on in few moment be glass half full kind of person although various labour members include the hon member for hitchin alistair strathern say that they would not be vote for the smartphone ban today could sense chink of light in what they be say perhaps they be start to come round to the idea my right hon friend the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay give great speech in which he mention the challenge pose by the large number of unaccompanied asylum seek child in the system who now represent third of all look after child in some local authority the hon member for woking mr forster give fantastically powerful speech about safeguard in which he speak about the tragic case of sara sharif although we will have to disagree about the policy the hon member for lowestoft jess asato give good speech argue for smacking ban my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds raise important question about unique identifier on which we all agree in principle but get it right will be crucial one of the most important speech be the excellent contribution by the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh she talk good sense and give the government good advice on part of the bill and on school she also propose sensible measure which we support to ensure that the flow of information around the system be all that it should be and that the same kind of information that be provide to the department be provide to those work on the frontline with child my hon friend the member for south west devon rebecca smith give bleak but important testimony her idea of covenant be important there be other good speech that have not mention but we end on an excellent note with the contribution make by the hon member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean he make the case for kinship care powerfully we be in agreement on that and hope that we will make progress on the issue as the bill go to the other place it be wonderful speech and he be completely correct that his grandparent would have be very proud to see he in this house reiterate my thank to all right hon and hon member across the house for their thoughtful contribution on range of amendment of which aim to cover as many as possible in the time available key pillar of this government reform of child social care be to shift the focus towards early support to help family together and to keep they together where possible will therefore begin with the amendment concern family group decision making table by the hon member for bristol central carla denyer and the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott on amendment we agree that the voice of the child and their view be integral in some case it may not be appropriate for the child to attend meeting however during family group decision making the local authority must seek the view of the child where appropriate statutory guidance will also set out that local authority should ensure that the facilitator have the right skill and training and be confident that skilled professional will engage the child in an appropriate way on amendment there be robust evidence that child can be divert from care when family group decision making be offer at the pre proceed stage we also encourage local authority to offer this process as early as possible in the child engagement with child service to support family first culture turn to amendment if look after child go to live with family member the care planning placement and case review england regulations already require care plan to be in place which must include arrangement to meet the child need and must be review at least every six month it would be inappropriate to assume that every child go to live with family member need child protection plan it be right that we protect all child at risk of harm but it be also right that we do not intervene in family life where child be safe loved and well support turn to new clause to table by the hon member for twickenham munira wilson emphasise how much the government value kinship carer they come forward to care for some of the most vulnerable child in society who would otherwise likely be in care we recognise the challenge that many kinship carer face in continue to access work alongside the pressure of raise child unexpectedly in october the government announce million of new funding for the kinship financial allowance pilot which will provide weekly financial allowance to kinship carer to support they with the additional cost incur when take on parental responsibility for their kin that be the single big investment make by government in kinship care to date and decision about future roll out will be inform by robust evaluation new clause would introduce new right to kinship care leave employ kinship carer may already benefit from number of workplace employment right design to support employee in balance work alongside care responsibility for example unpaid parental leave for employee who have or expect to have parental responsibility which we be make day one right through the employment rights bill we have also commit to review of the parental leave system to ensure that it well support all work family on new clause and we be provide more than billion of pupil premium funding school can direct spending where their need be great include to pupil in kinship care and such child may already be eligible for the high admission priority where they be or be look after by the local authority new section insert by clause of the bill state local authority must review and update its kinship local offer from time to time that give opportunity for the view and opinion of child live in kinship care and their carer to be take into account hope that the hon member for twickenham and for carshalton and wallington bobby dean and the right hon member for sevenoaks be reassure by that turn to new clause table by the hon member for south devon caroline voaden adoption be vital part of our system and it be important that we ensure that support be of high quality however ofsted already report regularly on adoption support in local authority child social care inspection report as well as on voluntary adoption agency and adoption support agency on new clause table by the chair of the education committee my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes increase support for care leaver be key government priority clause of the bill will build on exist provision by require each local authority to publish the arrangement it have in place to support and assist care leaver in their transition to adulthood and independent living that will include its arrangement for anticipate the future need of care leaver in respect of accommodation turn to the related new clause table by my hon friend the member for south shields mrs lewell buck which would extend staying put arrangement this new clause be not need as part of the bill we require each local authority to provide eligible care leaver with staying close support where their welfare require it that mean that all eligible young people who leave residential care can be support to find and keep suitable accommodation into adulthood turn to amendment thank the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith for raise the important principle of local authority listen and respond to the wish and feeling of eligible care leaver as set out in committee when assess and provide stay close support the local authority will be expect to have due regard to the accompany duty regard the creation and review of young person pathway plan the view of young people be expect to be consider as part of that turn to new clause which be also table by my hon friend the member for south shields and amendment and table by the right hon member for sevenoaks welcome the opportunity to discuss the quality of care in and oversight of child home and welcome the support of the opposition for the position implicit in their amendment that action need to be take to well equip ofste to deal with poor practice across child home however we do not believe that the new clause or these amendment be require introduce full inspection at provider group level would not be appropriate or well target way to use ofsted resource clause be deliberately design in way that supplement the exist robust regime for inspection of individual setting which ensure that ofsted can take the quick and most effective action to safeguard vulnerable child amendment would give local authority the power to issue an improvement plan notice to child home for minor concern or admin breach follow regulation visit which would add little value over and above what be already in place under exist regulation it be also not clear what would constitute minor concern or what regulatory action could follow it risk muddy the water of accountability and responsibility there be already mandatory national minimum standard through the supported accommodation england regulations and ofsted registration and inspection requirement for provider accommodate to year old look after child and care leaver new clause relate to notification for when child be place into temporary accommodation thank my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for her significant campaigning on this issue know that this morning she meet with my ministerial colleague who will follow up with she directly as she say in her contribution too many child be spend year in temporary accommodation at point in their life when they need space to play and develop as well as nutritious food to thrive and access to education although we do not accept the new clause understand the rationale behind it and commit to continue to work with my hon friend on the matter turn to child place in secure accommodation deprive child of their liberty must always be last resort and it be of paramount importance that any restriction place on child be appropriate and for no long than absolutely necessary however do not think that amendment to be necessary statutory regime already exist when child be be deprive of their liberty under section of the children act and this measure would extend that to relevant accommodation the bill give power to the secretary of state to make regulation for relevant accommodation and to set maximum period beyond which child may not be deprive of their liberty without the authorisation of the court we also intend to bring forward regulation to require local authority to seek approval from the secretary of state before depriving of their liberty child who be under the age of and in relevant accommodation turn to new clause table by my hon friend the member for lowestoft jess asato protect child at risk of abuse be at the heart of this bill regard the common law defence of reasonable chastisement we be look closely at the legal change make in wales and scotland but we have no plan to legislate at this stage wales be in the process of review the impact of change the law and will publish its finding by the end of we want to look at the evidence before take such significant legislative step now turn to new clause table by my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood all child must have an assessment of their health when they become look after exist regulation require that that assessment must be complete by register medical practitioner include assessment of emotional and mental health and be keep under review new clause table by the right hon member for sevenoaks be not require robust protection be already in place where proceeding have be initiate pre proceeding will almost always be initiate when local authority have determine that child protection activity be not sufficient to keep child safe and promote their welfare the initiation of proceeding will not result in automatic discharge of child protection plan such plan can be discharge only through decision take at the child protection conference between multi agency practitioner who have be work with the child and their family one area in which the government have not waste any time be take action against child sexual abuse new clause and cover recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse be address by the step that this government have take and will take to deliver the change and the justice that victim deserve in january the home secretary make statement to the house confirm that the government will lay out clear timetable for take forward the recommendation of the final iicsa report include

panel the government will also be implement all the remain recommendation of the iicsa separate stand alone report on groom gang from february as part of that we will update key guidance on child sexual exploitation second reading see political opportunism of the bad kind from the official opposition and would like to take this opportunity at the dispatch box to condemn it the home secretary the education secretary and the minister for combat violence against woman and girl all have track record of stand up against that abuse and they be act decisively in government let turn now to the new bandwagon that the conservatives have jump on that of mobile phone use in school and to new clause phone have no place in school that be what the education secretary say last week and it be as simple as that teacher and headteacher have the government full backing in rid our classroom of the disruption cause by phone and they already have the mean to do so we will be check that that be happen strengthen government monitoring of implementation of the guidance to ensure that our classroom be phone free however must note as number of member have mention tonight that just year ago the conservatives claim that their action mean mobile phone be prohibit in school and that their guidance mean consistent approach across all school that beg the question what have change not only do the right hon member for sevenoaks seem to have miss the education secretary statement she have miss the secretary of state for science and technology already announce the study that she be ask for those study be be conduct by the university of cambridge and will report back before the end of the school year she have even miss the health secretary confirm just this month that the chief medical officer will consider the impact of phone and advice for parent will the minister give way of course we hear parent concern about screen time but this be wide issue across the board that be not exclusive to school it be an issue on which we be already act across government to make sure that parent and teacher be support in ensure that child safety and wellbeing be protect interruption order can not hear the minister speak so assume that nobody else can the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse have the opportunity to speak in the debate but he have choose to turn up at the very end to make an intervention it just show what his interest be in these issue we take these matter seriously because we take child wellbee seriously the clue be in the name labour children wellbeing and schools bill the measure in the bill to protect child from harm improve their school and save their education from cause financial distress to their parent all relate to their wellbeing and we know that mental health go hand in hand with wellbeing be at this very dispatch box just last week to discuss the support we be offer in school and we will of course have more time to talk about those issue far understand that new clause seek to be supportive on this matter the government recognise the importance of understand trend in the wellbeing of child and young people indeed school be already encourage to measure pupil wellbee turn to the amendment table by the right hon member for sevenoaks relate to information sharing as set out in committee amendment would create very broad duty that would be difficult to implement in practice additionally work together to safeguard child already set out the duty of practitioner to share and act on information receive on amendment we agree that the documenting of decision about information sharing be important and we cover it in our non statutory guidance on information sharing we intend to strengthen this by address these matter in statutory guidance that relevant person would be require to have regard to finally turn to new clause and amendment and to topic that have become priority for labour members who be listen to our constituent who demand change that topic be support for child with send the last conservative education secretary deem the system that her party leave behind to be lose lose lose and the current conservative deputy chief whip the hon member for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra say that the conservatives do do enough and that they should hang our head in shame we agree the difference be that we be do something about it will be honest find it hard to take lecture from conservative members on education know the scale of the mess that they leave behind and the family they fail with no support no understanding and no plan to turn thing around when they come to this place and bemoan the change that this government be drive just find it shameful return to new clause and amendment appreciate the input of the hon member for twickenham and note that nothing be off the table when it come to send reform however this government do not want to tinker around the edge of what be frankly generational challenge reform must be wide range whole system and expert lead that be what we plan and we will set out our plan in due course also assure the hon member that we be consider the place of profit in special school hope she will agree that it would not be appropriate to extend the profit cap power to different sector before we set out plan to deal with issue in the send system we want to consider the role and function of independent special school holistically and we will set out our plan for send reform in due course in conclusion through our plan for change this government will give child grow up in our country the good start in life each day we be break down barrier to opportunity so that background do not determine where you end up in life so that if you work hard you can get on through its focus on drive high and rise school standard cut the cost of send child to school and as we have cover today stop vulnerable child fall through the crack this bill

and danny kruger be morden on behalf of the committee of selection domestic abuse offences motion make and question propose that this house do now turley it be an honour to lead this debate on domestic abuse offence and particular honour to do so on the very spot from which see the most moving speech that have ever see in the house of commons be give it be in around november or december time and it be give by michelle thomson who be then the independent member of parliament for edinburgh west she speak about her experience of abuse and be victim of violence at the hand of man and at the end of that speech she say be not victim be survivor official report december vol those word send shiver down my spine give goosebump and unlocked in real determination to try to use my own experience and my family experience to improve what life be like for victim and survivor across the country say in michelle thomson word that too be not victim but be survivor as result of that and also of my mum experience at the hand of former partner of hers we know what domestic abuse look like know what it be to be cry upstairs under the cover as child listen to shout scream smash and the rest come from downstair and not know if mum be okay know what it be to go downstairs the morning after and see broken glass or kick in hoover and the rest and to not know whether mum be okay know what it be to live in household where you be worried that any word that you say any movement that you do and any thought that you might have can be attack by an abuser in your own home who be mean to keep you safe and who you be mean to trust there be so many people across our country who be victim and survivor of domestic abuse and other form of abuse it be estimate that one in five people will be victim or survivor of domestic abuse in their lifetime in my view the law do not go far enough to protect people in those circumstance great progress be make in the last parliament in the form of the domestic abuse act which define domestic abuse in law for the first time it also create series of domestic abuse align offence include coercive and control behaviour non fatal strangulation and non fatal suffocation but be afraid that that piece of legislation and indeed our legislative framework overall do not go far enough to recognise the domestic abuse that my family have experience and that many member of this house will be familiar with too an example of failing in the law exist in the form of the experience undergo by an extremely brave and inspirational survivor elizabeth hudson elizabeth be victim survivor of domestic abuse at the hand of her ex husband he among many other terrible act at home hold knife to her throat he be convict of assault occasion actual bodily harm for his crime for she and for so many such conviction do not reflect the full gravity or the full circumstance of such nefarious crime that have lead to all sort of problem not just for elizabeth but for many other survivor as well first commend the hon gentleman for his courage in tell his personal story we be all move by it know be and thank he for that he have show himself to be determined capable member of parliament and wish he well across northern ireland we witness people be arrest for first time domestic offence ultimately the charge be not prosecute in court and the case be drop fast forward and people be re arrest for domestic charge that be in fact bad show pattern of escalate violence do he agree that arrest for domestic abuse must be fully investigate and if prove prosecute to the full extent of the law to protect people from violence and instil confidence in the judicial system thank my friend the hon member for his kind word and completely agree that all abuser domestic or not must face the full force of the law it be critical that happen for victim and survivor to have confidence in the police and our wide criminal justice system and that be lack for many victim and survivor we see that in some of the consequence of the standard determinate sentence early release scheme that the government have to implement in the light of the poor state that the last government leave our prison in thank the hon member for bring forward such an important debate do he agree that one of the challenge of the current system be that domestic abuser and perpetrator be often convict of single act when domestic abuse happen over many year and can vary in the type of attack and abuse that happen convict abuser and perpetrator for the totality of their abuse therefore become difficult and the prosecution will often go for the easy single act to convict thereby early release and the length of the conviction do not reflect the amount of abuse that their victim survivor have have to endure the hon member be absolutely right that domestic abuse be more than just an act it be campaign campaign of abuse of misery and of an abuse of power by one or more people against another and that be what make it so difficult to convict there be so many area in which the law could do well and be speak about the early release scheme as an example the scheme would release folk who have serve of their sentence rather than the government nobly make commitment to survivor that they would do everything possible to exclude domestic abuser from be release early under the scheme recognise that it can be super destabilising for survivor who need to prepare for when their abuser be back in society their community and their neighbourhood unfortunately we know many domestic abuser be release early under the scheme that happen because the only way someone can be exclude from or include in an early release scheme be on the basis of the offence they have commit something the justice secretary have confirm and not on the basis of anything else we might know about their behaviour the problem be there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in the law we therefore can not properly exclude those people from an early release scheme if that be something we be commit to those survivor instead we know domestic abuser be often convict of actual bodily harm assault or battery those offence be criminalise by an act write in the offences against the person act that be not write with domestic abuse in mind as result so many domestic abuser be fall through the crack and so many victim and survivor do not get the justice or recognition they deserve congratulate the hon gentleman justice committee colleague on secure this debate victim of domestic violence be often woman do he believe we would likely give domestic violence more attention if it be classify as domestic abuse do he think that might make difference in give more attention to domestic violence case thank my justice committee colleague for his intervention of course domestic violence be form of domestic abuse but we must remember that domestic abuse cover so many different kind of activity include emotional abuse financial abuse physical abuse and sexual abuse it be critical that we recognise they all because all too often there be disproportionate recognition of say physical violence but some of the more hidden form of abuse be just as damaging to victim and survivor thank the hon gentleman for secure debate on this incredibly important issue be the mp for stafford eccleshall and the village and women aid staffordshire be base in my constituency have raise these statistic before but we have see increase in referral to its sexual violence service in recent year and an increase in referral to its specialist counselling service do the hon gentleman agree that we be face national crisis thank the hon lady for share those statistic more than national crisis this be national emergency and women aid have rightly declare it so that be why it be now more important than ever that our legal framework properly recognise domestic abuse in law have describe how our current legislation be leave survivor without the respect and the protection they deserve for example many abuser qualify for early release when the government intention be that they should not have raise this number of time in this house and beyond include on the justice committee ross gribbin director general at the ministry of justice confirm that the only way of close this loophole be through primary legislation that this house must debate and vote on that lead we to think about the solution to patch up this legal loophole the solution must be to create specific offence of domestic abuse in law have propose very specific way of do it in consultation with number of stakeholder and that be to create series of domestic abuse aggravate offence in law in the same way that we have racially and religiously aggravate abh gbh assault and so on we would have domestic abuse equivalent thank the hon gentleman for make powerful speech on subject that know matter to so many people in this house do the hon gentleman agree that we need to consider not just aggravate offence but sentencing kill women be campaign to close the sentencing gap perpetrator who murder woman at home receive short sentence than those who murder woman on the street have domestic abuse aggravate offence would end that injustice when it come to sentencing thank the hon gentleman for make that point the law be already go some way to achieve that domestic abuse be already an aggravate factor in sentencing at the back end but it be not an aggravate factor at the front end in term of the offence for which people can be convict we know there be precedent for make domestic abuse an aggravating factor the crime and disorder act introduce number of aggravating factor and it be extend to include racially and religiously aggravate offence we ought to amend that legislation to include domestic abuse however this be about far more than be able to include or exclude domestic abuser from early release scheme this be also about datum ask the ministry of justice very simple write parliamentary question just before christmas how many domestic abuser be currently in prison and what be their reoffende rate the response be it be not possible to robustly calculate the number of domestic abuser in prison or their reoffende rate this be because these crime be record under the specific offence for which they be prosecute in other word we do not know how many domestic abuser there be because there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in law instead they be convict of for example offence under the offences against the person act this be national scandal we should know how many domestic abuser there be in prison the government have powerful ambition which fully support to halve violence against woman and girl over the next decade but how can we possibly know whether we be achieve it if we do not know how many domestic abuser be in prison at any give time more than that if we be serious about reduce reoffende dedicate my career before come into this place to do exactly that kind of work how can we know what kind of intervention be the most successful if we have no way of measure that because there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in law commend my hon friend for speak so eloquently and movingly about his personal experience there be recognise link between animal abuse and domestic abuse pay tribute to organisation such as the links group that train veterinary professional to recognise when the case they be see may be indicator of abuse or domestic abuse which tie in exactly with what he be say if there be no specific offence of domestic abuse it be really hard to signpost and give guidance to everyone in the community on how to proceed so that people be identify and help at an early stage completely agree we know that there be link between domestic abuse and animal abuse we also know that there be link between domestic abuse and child sexual abuse for example this be link that have experience the hard way again our legislation and the datum we be collect be not help we to make that link in the way that we could so that we could figure out which intervention be good at bust these social ill there be more reason why specific offence of domestic abuse be so critical let we take clare law which be the scheme that allow individual mostly woman to request to see information about the offend history of their partner if they qualify for the scheme they get to see thing like the charge that individual have face or the offence they have be convict of it would be very easy for an abusive partner to explain away conviction or charge for assault or battery as say brawl with stranger in pub but would they be able to explain away domestic abuse aggravate assault in the same way no thank my hon friend for make such powerful speech and for his courage and leadership on this matter he ask about the way in which the perpetrator of domestic abuse might hide their crime in my constituency of bicester and woodstock have hear too many example of woman suffer abuse who be not find way to cut through to the authority do he agree that too often cut to victim support and an inaccessibility of legal aid be prevent the victim of domestic abuse from start the process that might ultimately lead to charge for the kind of aggravate offence that he be so rightly call for my hon friend be absolutely right it be critical at time like now when we have hear about the scale of the national emergency of domestic abuse that victim support organisation be adequately fund have meet representative of number of organisation include victim support that in light of cut to police and crime commissioner core funding and the national insurance contribution increase be face real term funding cut we should be fund these organisation more not less at this time to support constituent such as those my hon friend have mention there might be some challenge to my proposal challenge that be put to be josh might this not lead to the very sentencing inflation that the government be try to avoid now to ensure that our prison do not fill up so quickly my response to that be twofold first domestic abuse as we have explore in this debate be already an aggravate factor in sentencing it already carry great sentence be propose that we enhance the front end as say early not just the back end my second response to that challenge be that the crime and policing bill that the government put before this house very recently second reading be last week create number of brand new offence they be offence that completely agree with and commend the government for include assault of shop worker and dedicated offence of spike these be the right thing to do but if we can do that for those crime surely we can do it for the crime of domestic abuse remember in the crime and policing bill debate several member particularly on the government side praise the trade union for their campaigning to get the offence of assault against shop worker over the line agree that great campaigning by trade union help to achieve that but the survivor and victim of domestic abuser do not have such union we in this house be their union which be why we must campaign for dedicated offence of domestic abuse to protect they be pleased and proud that so many have rally around this proposal to create specific set of domestic abuse offence in the law woman aid mankind initiative refuge victim support and many more charity and support organisation in this space believe that this need to be do be really grateful to many of my liberal democrat colleague who be sit around now for back this proposal but also to those across this house be particularly thankful to member on the government benches who have privately reach out to to express their support for these proposal and know number of they have express that support to their front benchers as well be grateful to lot of our medium outlet for get behind this and for platforme the campaign in particular the team at good morning britain which help launch this campaign and the bill be hold in my hand to make this propose offence close to reality be also thankful for the many warm and constructive conversation have have with ministers include the minister for victim the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones the minister for safeguard the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips who meet couple of week ago and the minister for prison lord timpson but also for the exchange have have with the solicitor general and the secretary of state for justice in this chamber appreciate that constructiveness but be really keen now for more than warm word be keen for action victim and survivor need and deserve the recognition that the creation of brand new specific offence of domestic abuse in law would create and stand ready to work with anyone in this chamber and beyond to make it reality thank the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde for speak so movingly and convincingly want to raise the case of constituent who have come to with multiple problem to do with her abusive husband he be not yet her ex husband because he be stall the divorce process and hiding and dissipate asset work briefly in family law so know that this be by no mean an unusual situation and that in most case it be the man who be involve in perpetrate this sort of thing if this be happen in any other situation for instance between two business partner such action would be prosecute as fraud but when pursue through the family court as they be all the time they be not prosecute at all they be just treat as one of those thing section of the serious crime act create the offence of control or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship an example of coercive or control behaviour be economic abuse include coerce debt control spending and similar activity however in this case the husband be no long directly control or coerce the wife because they be separate he be just spend all of their money and she can not stop it economic abuse that relate to deliberately dissipate someone else asset be not really deal with many victim of domestic abuse have their personal finance ruin in the course of their relationship it be real problem that any insolvency solution that might help they to rebuild their finance involve have their home address and other personal detail publish online in the insolvency register that deter lot of people from get involve in the insolvency solution that would enable they to start to rebuild their finance and their life one can apply to withhold the detail of address and so forth but that involve paperwork possible court proceeding and fee of which be huge amount of money for someone who be already in an insolvency process there be strong argument that we need to reform the process and potentially make the insolvency register private finally again thank the hon member for eastbourne for secure the debate thank cheshire without abuse which do work in this area in my constituency and the money wellness service which people can engage with if they be have money difficulty the hon lady have bring to mind circumstance that as an elect representative have witness on number of occasion over the past few year married man have secure loan on joint account hold with his wife but then when the relationship fall apart and all the money in the bank be away she be leave with the loan so she be do over twice that be an example of situation that could be sort out in the legislation that the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde refer to and thank the hon lady for mention the issue have see instance like that within my own social circle it be not unusual and lot of the people involve appear to be people who would have engage with the bank know bank have some safeguard around this sort of thing now but they be inadequate and people be often leave in terrible financial situation in conclusion thank the hon member for eastbourne and wish he luck with his campaign congratulate the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde on secure this important debate and thank he for his commitment to tackle domestic abuse his leadership be not just political but deeply personal and shape by his own experience it drive his advocacy for well support for victim and survivor his dedication be truly inspiring only through work in partnership across government and society will we succeed in tackle domestic abuse and halve violence against woman and girl the hon gentleman passion dedication and personal commitment to this cause shin light on the challenge face by victim and survivor and look forward to continue to work with he as the house will be aware this government be elect on landmark pledge to halve violence against woman and girl over the next decade and drive down domestic abuse be right at the heart of that pledge for too long the justice system have not be work for domestic abuse victim we know that report be high than they be five year ago while prosecution be low that be unacceptable we have take swift action to begin reform the system to well support victim and ensure that they have access to justice across government we be take step to improve the justice system response to domestic abuse from the first time that someone call the police to court and all the way through to the way in which perpetrator be manage after sentence we have introduce domestic abuse specialist in call centre in select area so that when victim call the police specialist can support first responder to assess the risk and ensure that there be an appropriate response the crown prosecution service and the national police chiefs council have launch the domestic abuse joint justice plan which bring police and prosecution expert together for strong more co ordinate approach to investigate and charge domestic abuse so that we

be underpin by new strategy to combat violence against woman and girl which we will publish later this year now turn to the particular interest of the hon member for eastbourne in create cohort of domestic abuse offender in order to exclude these offender from early release measure as he have set out as he know be an emergency measure introduce to avert prison capacity crisis that this government sadly inherit however we make sure to exclude certain offence from that change include sex offence irrespective of sentence length serious violent offence with sentence of four year or more and series of offence link to domestic abuse include stalk coercive or control behaviour and non fatal strangulation as the hon member have say exclusion from the policy be base on offence not offender this mean that it have not be possible to exclude all offender with domestic abuse history as there be no current single mean of determine whether give conviction be for an offence commit in the context of domestic abuse be hugely sympathetic to the issue that the hon member have raise this evening however be not convince that his particular solution create series of domestic abuse aggravate offence be the right one be concerned about the unintended consequence of attempt to capture and define via list of specific offence the full spectrum of offence in which domestic abuse could be factor as we have hear this evening that spectrum of offence be vast and be extremely wary that attempt to capture they in list could unwittingly create system in which some offence be deem serious enough to constitute offence that could be aggravate by domestic abuse whereas other offence in which domestic abuse could play part be not for example we should not return to the outdated view that domestic abuse only involve physical violence as my hon friend the member for congleton mrs russell have say economic abuse should also be take into consideration and it will be core part of this government violence against woman and girl strategy this government be dedicate to ensure that the harm cause by offence typically commit against woman and girl include domestic abuse be appropriately and proportionately reflect in the sentencing framework that be why the sentencing review chair by david gauke the former lord chancellor have be ask to look specifically at the sentence for offence primarily commit against woman and girl recognise that be able to well identify domestic abuse offender throughout the system and to capture that data be important in support victim and manage perpetrator thank the minister for her response and for her feedback appreciate that set static list of offence to which domestic abuse aggravation be connect could mean that when offence and the nature of domestic abuse change thing get leave behind would she therefore consider more open ended aggravation that be dynamic and could attach to any offence what have propose be an aggravation on the basis of the definition in the domestic abuse act would she consider more dynamic one that do not list finite number of offence the hon member make an important point and he have pre empte the next section of my speech the government and be actively consider how we can well identify domestic abuse offender and want to reassure he that nothing be off the table would be happy to work with he and invite he to come and meet to discuss how good we do that in more detail know he have similar agreement from my ministerial colleague and those he have already meet to discuss it tackle domestic abuse be top priority for this government and core part of our mission to halve violence against woman and girl over the next decade we be work across government and use every lever in our power to deliver against that ambition not more rhetoric but action deed not word question put and agree to house adjourn
