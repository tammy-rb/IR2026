previous post office minister and the house will know of my commitment and my party commitment to the individual whose life have be tear apart by this scandal it be right that the post office horizon system offences act receive royal assent during wash up to quash the conviction of hundred of affected postmaster but the minister will know that the act itself do not provide compensation which be why alongside that legislation we announce plan for new horizon conviction redress scheme this scheme will make compensation payment to those who have have conviction quash by the act in government we ensure that royal assent be achieve as soon as possible so that there be no gap in the availability of compensation it be only right that postmaster have access to swift and fair compensation that be why we overturn those conviction those with overturn conviction have the option of immediately take fixed and final offer of it be also why in government we change the rule for those in the horizon shortfall scheme so that they be entitle to fix sum award bypass the assessment process so that all full and final settlement below that figure would be automatically top up and so that an appeal process for those in the hss be also consider although be pleased that as of may approximately million have be pay to over claimant across the scheme must push the government for more detail on when

let stick to the rule and start as we mean to go on thank you mr speaker the shadow secretary of state set out the intent he have in government which we intend to carry on we also believe there be absolutely no reason why we should not continue to work on cross party basis as we agree with he on the importance of deliver fast and fair compensation which be at the heart of all we be try to achieve we will be make statement by the end of july before the summer recess as the shadow secretary of state have already note we have commit to do that we be work at pace with official victim and those who have be affect by the scandal to work up the detail and an announcement will be make in due course it be good to see you back in your place mr speaker the new minister will recall the old saying that new broom sweep clean and be sure he will make progress very quickly indeed it seem to that the post office scandal reveal wide problem in british society whether it be orgreave grenfell contaminate blood or the problem at hillsborough the british establishment seem incapable of listen to the voice of ordinary people will he raise that matter with other ministers and see whether there be way for this government to ensure that be not repeat my hon friend raise an interesting point in recent year we as members have reflect on the question of political accountability for decision that have be take and action that have take place over many year we will be reflect on how good to ensure there be genuine political accountability in the system call the liberal democrat spokesperson also welcome you back to your place mr speaker it be genuine pleasure for as the liberal democrat spokesperson to be address the house on behalf of the third large political grouping my party will use the privilege of that position to hold the government and ministers to account we will not be use it simply to stoke division and manufacture grievance that be what the people of the united kingdom and scotland in particular vote for at the heart of the horizon scandal be the culture at the centre of the organisation that fail to respect the work that be be do by sub postmaster at the frontline the minister and the secretary of state will meet with the chief executive of the post office what evidence have they see that that culture have actually change do not know if the right hon gentleman be aware that the current chief executive officer have step aside for brief period to concentrate on the inquiry over the come month we will be reflect on the important question that the right hon gentleman raise particularly when the outcome of the inquiry be know refer to the point raise by my hon friend the member for normanton and hemsworth jon trickett what role do the minister think this government can find for third party organisation such as whistleblowersuk or those organisation that work with people to highlight such scandal as my hon friend point out this be systematic failure across government and society and we simply can not allow it to happen again my understanding be that the last government undertake consultation on whistleblowing we be reflect on the outcome of that and on the important point my hon friend raise across whole range of body in this country whistleblower have not be hear we need to consider whether the current legislation give they sufficient confidence to speak out and whether their action and concern be be address many congratulation on your re election mr speaker congratulate the minister on his appointment know he be genuinely committed to promote british business at home and abroad but be he aware of serious issue flow from the horizon scandal that be now affect current postmaster in order to express their disgust at what have happen in relation to horizon some member of the public be not use the post office in the way they do previously will he and the government commit to promote the view that the post office be safe to use because the scandal have be resolve and because use post office be good for the community be concerned to hear about such incident it should go without say that the postmaster be not the one who should take the opprobrium of the public on this matter they be do fantastic job they hold community together and provide public service we should celebrate that and encourage people to use their facility as much as possible if the right hon gentleman have specific example of postmaster receive abuse or people be discourage to use their service because of the scandal would be interested to hear about they it be delight to see you back in the chair mr speaker there be many sub postmaster and mistress who be not convict but who be seriously out of pocket due to the shortfall that they themselves make up and deeply traumatise by the experience that they go through can the minister provide reassurance that the department will seek to ensure that they be support and that the compensation scheme be swift effective but also very straightforward for they thank the right hon member for her question those be the principle that we want to address and carry on with from the previous government the system should be fair swift and simple we know that postmaster have already go through an incredibly difficult time we do not want to make it even hard by have convoluted system we absolutely agree that justice should be fair quick complete and straightforward for people beyond compensation one of the most important thing that campaigner be look for be consequence for those people who play part in the creation of this scandal the prime minister have make much about the integrity and accountability of his government presumably that be retrospective what consequence do the minister envisage for those current serve government ministers who be deem by the inquiry to have be negligent in their conduct in ministerial office in the past that be very important question it would be premature of we to draw conclusion before the inquiry have be complete but absolutely we should be look very carefully at all those individual whose behaviour unfortunately lead to the scandal happen and to it take far too long to address that be matter for the inquiry to make recommendation on and certainly we will be look to follow those up welcome the minister to his place know that he be vociferous on this issue when he be on the opposition back benches so have absolutely no doubt that he will deliver on it some postmaster implicate in the scandal in northern ireland be worried and concerned it be imperative that all postmaster feel that they can have an open and frank discussion with no fear of repercussion in the upcoming investigation and there can be no far unwarranted delay can the minister confirm that as priority he will make sure that postmaster have access at every level to ensure that their concern be address and that he will make every effort to take step in the right direction thank you so much mr speaker do not see why that point should have come last laughter what surprise to see the hon member in his place today be sure that this will not be last time that we have an exchange across the dispatch box but he do raise an important point we absolutely agree that we need to make it as easy as possible for postmaster to raise their concern and to get the justice that they have so long wait for congratulate you mr speaker on your return to your place and the minister on take up his appointment compensation be one part of this but what victim of this scandal such as betty whom meet want to see be truth and accountability be refer not just to ministers to whom my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse refer but to those involve in the scandal what can the minister say to people in the post office and to betty who want to see those responsible in the post office properly hold to account as well as the compensation for their suffering thank the hon member for his question he make an important point justice be one side of the coin but there be also accountability for what have happen lot of people want to see that not just those directly affect but everyone who have be outrage by the year of inertia and obfuscation that we have see in this scandal the purpose of the inquiry be to get to the heart of who know what who do what and who do not do what they should have do and whether individual should take some responsibility for their action have no doubt that when those recommendation be release we will want to see some very swift action on the back of that be privileged to be one of those mp who decade ago be campaign on this issue in parliament with the now lord arbuthnot and campaign on case in my constituency people have be treat appallingly those people have not yet receive compensation if there be go to be any kind of delay in compensation to those who have suffer be there any way that early interim payment can be make to those who need the support now and certainly before too long thank the hon member for his question and join he in praise lord arbuthnot work in this area as of may million have already be pay out in compensation there have actually be significant interim payment as well we understand that while this be very large scheme it be important that we get early payment so assure the hon member that interim payment be very large part of this programme the legislation that we pass be blanket measure it might be clear to we who be or be not include but for the individual affect it will not necessarily have be clear will the minister update the house on the progress that have be make in identify they and write to they to confirm that their conviction have be quash thank the hon member for his important question we have be work closely with colleague in the ministry of justice to identify those people who be affect by the legislation and

to all colleague elect on july include those opposition members who have to work so hard to survive what be an electoral tsunami of biblical proportion especially congratulate those on both side of the house who be elect for the first time it be huge honour to serve in this house my particular congratulation go to the right hon member for manchester central lucy powell on her appointment as leader of the house hope that she have have the opportunity to practise wield sword for several hour and wear an embroider cape with panache her predecessor penny mordaunt be an expert at do both thing when look at the hansard of previous exchange notice that in the final business question of the last parliament the shadow leader of the house as she be then pay tribute to penny renowned formidable blow dry haircut can only apologise to the house for my own short back and side be nothing in comparison know colleague on both side of the house will miss penny wish she well and hope she return here before too long thank the house staff and clerks for their work welcome new member and the leader of the house for the collegiate approach she have take in our private discussion so far however of course these exchange be an opportunity to raise question about house business and the associated conduct of government although the new government be less than two week old there be already some question would like to raise first the government have announce with no reference at all to parliament that the rwanda scheme enable by bills that this house pass have be scrap the scheme have be due to start next week and would have provide deterrent to illegal immigration across the channel we have see deterrent of that kind work elsewhere since this government come into office more than people have illegally and dangerously cross the channel with four tragically die these crossing be unnecessary france be safe when will the government come to the house to explain the change of policy and will there be any vote on it move on accord to press report the energy secretary decide last week to cancel all new application for oil and gas licence in the north sea if true that will increase energy price and make we more dependent on potentially unreliable foreign gas import why do the government not first come to the house to explain the new policy and will there be vote on it the chancellor give speech last week on housing and planning during which the housing secretary and deputy prime minister simply sit and listen in rather uncharacteristic silence the chancellor announce that green belt protection will be scrap or as she euphemistically put it the green belt will be rebrande as the grey belt rename whole swathe of green belt as grey belt be piece of shameless spin that would make even peter mandelson blush when will the government come to the house to explain their plan for the removal of green belt protection the chancellor also make some outlandish claim about the economy and public finance the economy be in fact in fantastic condition yes it be member should listen inflation be down to low than in the eurozone and the united states wage growth in contrast be much high at unemployment be low at half the level leave behind by the previous labour government and the uk economic growth so far this year be the high in the understand that the chancellor might make statement at some point to the house on these topic will the leader of the house confirm that any claim about public finance make in this house will be accompany by full office for budget responsibility forecast so we can be sure that any such claim be not simply be concoct by the chancellor as pretext for tax rise mr speaker have list several major policy announcement make in the past day with no reference to parliament at all you quite rightly say to the previous government on many occasion that major policy announcement should be make when parliament be sit and first to the house would welcome your assistance in ensure that the new government adhere to those principle finally then ask the leader of the house to make commitment now that all major policy announcement will be make only when the house be sit as the speaker previously request and first to this house of commons where elect member from all party can ask question include the or so newly elect labour members who be sure want to ask question as well would be very grateful if she would confirm that order think the problem be that people comment ought to reflect their previous job as well maybe that comment be from knowledge about make statement outside the house do not know do not make any judgment the right hon gentleman be absolutely correct that when the house be not sit of course statement will be make by the government but when the house be sit expect they to be make in the house that have be very clear message and the leader of the house and be both work to ensure that statement be hear here first certainly take the point on board but do not want to be draw into what we should or should not be do in the future welcome the ability to clarify the position thank you very much mr speaker start by thank his majesty the king for yesterday speech and join colleague in wish her majesty the queen happy birthday for yesterday also thank the staff and security service who have work so hard both to get parliament ready for the king speech and on the huge task of transition from the last parliament to this one with so many new member and so many leave the

top and most urgent priority may also congratulate you on your re election you be always fair and consider and always put member interest first today might be the first big test of whether you know

hope that they do not all drop down with fresher flu we lose some good colleague from all side at the election pay tribute to my predecessor penny mordaunt who be always worthy opponent across the dispatch box she bring fresh approach not only to this role but as the first female defence secretary always think that she be an underused asset for the conservative party and she will be miss especially by the parliamentary hairdresser welcome the shadow leader of the house the right hon member for croydon south chris philp to his new role know that he have always be keen after hold very

last parliament for the first time on record he be chief secretary to the treasury when former prime minister liz truss crash the economy send mortgage rate soar since we have come into government we have discover that thing be even bad than we think interruption the conservatives do not like it but be afraid it be true the order leader of the house the country vote resoundingly for change because it be bad off so the conservative party would be well advise to look deeply at why it lose rather than claim that people never have it so good the right hon gentleman ask about the rwanda plan the record speak for itself four volunteer be all that scheme achieve and far from stop the boat or act as deterrent the government preside over the high number of small boat crossing on record it be an

deliver that target in the election campaign as he know the conservatives in government withdraw the house building target which then reduce figure what we be not propose here be developer free for

that some member will be disappoint not to get in we will keep list and try to make sure that we get you in next time business question last for about an hour and you can help and each other by ask short punchy question prison capacity with permission mr speaker will make statement about prison capacity in england and wales as you know mr speaker want to make this announcement first in this house however give the scale of the emergency face our prison be force to set out these measure before parliament return since this government take office two week ago it have become clear that our prison be in crisis and be at the point of collapse the male prison estate have be run at over capacity for the last month we now know that my predecessor warn no downing street but rather than address this crisis the former prime minister call an election leave tick time bomb if that bomb be to go off if our prison be to run out of space the court would grind to halt suspect could not be hold in custody and police officer would be unable to make arrest leave criminal free to act without consequence in short if we fail to act now we face the prospect of total breakdown of law and order rather than act the last prime minister allow we to edge ever close to catastrophe last week there be around space remain in the male prison estate with place leave we reach critical capacity at that point the small change could trigger the chain of event just set out with the prison population rise it be now clear that by september this year our prison will overflow that mean there be now only one way to avert disaster as the house know most of those serve standard determinate sentence leave prison at the halfway point serve the rest of their sentence in the community the government now have no option but to introduce temporary change in the law yesterday we lay statutory instrument in draft subject to the agreement of both houses those serve eligible standard determinate sentence will leave prison after serve rather than of their sentence in custody and will serve the rest on licence our impact assessment estimate that around offender will be release in september and october from that time until we be able to reverse this emergency measure will be the new point of automatic release for eligible standard determinate sentence the government do not take this decision lightly but to disguise reality and delay any far as the last government do be unconscionable we be clear that this be the safe way forward in the word of the metropolitan police commissioner sir mark rowley these step be the least bad option he go on to say that the bad possible thing would be for the system to block and that any alternative to these measure would be dangerous for the public understand that some may feel worried by this decision but can assure the house that we be take every precaution available to we there will be important exclusion sentence for the most dangerous crime for sexual and serious violent offence will not change that will also be the case for series of offence link to domestic violence include stalk control or coercive behaviour and non fatal strangulation as well as those relate to national security we will also implement stringent protection first this change will not take effect until early september give the probation service time to prepare secondly all offender release will be subject to strict licence condition to ensure they can be manage safely in the community thirdly offender can be order to wear electronic tag and curfew will be impose where appropriate finally if offender breach the condition of their licence they can be return to prison immediately let be clear this be an emergency measure not permanent change this government be clear that criminal must be punish we do not intend to allow the release point to stand in perpetuity that be why will review these measure again in month time when the situation in our prison will have stabilise throughout this government will be transparent we will publish datum on the number of offender release on quarterly basis and we will publish an annual prison capacity statement legislate to make this statutory requirement when we implement this change we will stop the end of custody supervise licence scheme introduce by the last government which operate under veil of secrecy from the opposition benches be force to demand more information about who be be release and what crime they have commit this government have now release that datum show that over offender be release early often with very little warning to probation officer place they under enormous strain this be only ever short term fix it be one of series of decision this government believe must be examine more fully which be why we be announce review into how this capacity crisis be allow to happen and why the necessary decision be not take at critical moment the measure have set out today be not silver bullet the capacity crisis will not disappear immediately and these measure will take time to take effect but when they do they will give we the time to address the prison crisis not just today but for year to come this include accelerate the prison building programme to ensure we have the cell we need later this year we will publish ten year capacity strategy that strategy will outline the step that the government will take to acquire land for new prison site and will classify prison as be of national importance place decision making in ministers hand the government be also committed to long term reform and cut reoffende too often our prison create well criminal not well citizen and nearly of offending be reoffende all at immense cost to community and the taxpayer as lord chancellor my priority be to drive down that number to do that the government will strengthen probation start with the recruitment of at least new trainee probation officer by the end of march we will work with prison to improve offender access to learning and other training as well as bring together prison governor local employer and the voluntary sector to get ex offender into work we know that if an offender have job within year of release they be less likely to reoffend it be only by drive down reoffende that we will find sustainable solution to the prison crisis in speech last week call the previous occupant of downing street the guilty man do not use that analogy flippantly believe that they place the country in grave danger their legacy be prison system in crisis moment from catastrophic disaster it be only by pure luck and the heroic effort of prison and probation staff that disaster do not strike while they be in office the legacy of this government will be different we will see prison system bring under control probation service that keep the public safe enough prison place to meet our need and prison probation and other service work together to break the cycle of reoffende and so cut crime never think that would have to announce the measure that have set out today but the scale of this emergency have force this government to act now rather than delay any long this government will always put the country and its safety first commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister be grateful to the lord chancellor for very timely advance sight of her statement may take this opportunity to congratulate she on her appointment as well as the under secretary of state for justice the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones congratulate the minister of state ministry of justice the hon member for swindon south heidi alexander on her return to this place notwithstanding the occasional tussle across the dispatch box look forward to work constructively with lord chancellor and to hold she and the government to account she be of course decent courteous and incredibly able person and wish she well in her role we recognise the challenge and pressure face the prison and criminal justice system and the need to ensure that our prison function effectively of course the government be well aware of those thing when they be in opposition as know from challenge oral question session in government we take the right decision to significantly toughen up sentence for those who commit the bad crime in order to ensure that society be protect to reflect that we set in train the big prison building programme since the victorian era more than additional prison place be deliver while we be in government two new prison open one prison be under construction there be two prison with planning permission and one prison be on the cusp of decision labour planning permission proposal for prison would not impact any of those development in that respect it be simply gimmick crucially in the covid pandemic support by the then opposition we make the tough but correct decision not to mass release prisoner as other country do and we maintain that bedrock of our justice system trial by jury those correct decision mean less space and the number of people on remand wait for trial or sentencing dramatically increase from around to with result additional pressure in decide to reduce capacity pressure the paramount consideration for the lord chancellor must always be public protection with that in mind although we will of course have to scrutinise the detail of her propose sentence reduction scheme must say that we have significant public protection concern about what she have announce so far and hope that she will be able to address those concern today the lord chancellor set out plan for limited exclusion relate to domestic abuse but can she confirm that if domestic abuser be convict of say common assault as be often the case they would not be exempt from this policy what exclusion do she plan to put in place to ensure that the bad persistent repeat offender can not benefit from this scheme she set out that this be temporary measure that will be review after month what criterion will she set for its ending well still will she commit to sunsette the measure in the delegate legislation and to return to the house on this afresh in month if need what additional resource be be make available to probation we hear what the lord chancellor say about get more trainee probation staff by march but how many of those will actually be new how many will be additional to those whom we already plan to have in place through the exist trajectory for new trainee can she guarantee that no prisoner will benefit from her early release scheme without gps tag and strict condition indeed will she mandate the imposition of gps track can she confirm to the house progress on bring hmp dartmoor place back into use and her long term plan for hmp dartmoor place the previous government commit million to acquire land for build new prison and have already begin draw up site longlist be she expand that fund or merely re announce the same thing more widely the lord chancellor state that this be temporary measure to ease pressure so what be her long term plan for meet demand be she plan to scrap the tough sentence for serious crime that the conservatives put in place to protect the public and so to reverse our change or be she plan to build more prison over and above the six that we commit to funding to meet future demand if it be the latter have the chancellor agree the significant extra funding need those be the long term question to which she and the government owe this house and the public answer give the change that she be make today hope that she will be able to give clear answer welcome the shadow lord chancellor to his place we have always work constructively together wherever appropriate and look forward to continue to do so while he be in post he make heroic attempt to gloss over many year of failure in planning by the previous government be surprised that he manage to say it all with straight face he know full well that for many year the previous government struggle to get such measure past many of their back benchers not all of whom have return post the general election but some of whom remain here and remain implacable opponent of any kind of planning development in their constituency they think that national infrastructure be good thing as long as it be elsewhere look forward to see whether there be change of heart among those on the opposition benches it would be welcome because this government will not allow the planning system to prevent our country from have either the prison place or the national infrastructure that we so desperately need he also know full well that of the place that be suppose to have be provide by the previous government by only have be deliver be concern about the position relate to prisoner on remand the shadow lord chancellor rightly note that the number of those on remand in our prison estate be around of course judge need to be able to remand people to prison for public protection reason that will not change he will know give his former role in the department that there be no immediate solution because many of those individual will in the end be sentence to custody be consider all option available to for drive that number down as much as possible in the end we will need our year capacity plan to take account of what we expect the sentence population to look like on the sentence that be cover by this measure the shadow lord chancellor will know that in order to make change by mean of statutory instrument it have to relate to specific offence that be why we have take every precaution and every option available to we to exclude sentence connect to domestic abuse he know that those will include be sure that he have see the draft statutory instrument offence relate to the breaching of non molestation order stalk which mention in my statement include stalk involve the fear of violence serious alarm or distress strangulation or suffocation control or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship the breach of restraining order and breach of domestic abuse protection order the common offence that we know be connect to domestic abuse be catch in the statutory instrument on multiple and repeat offence he will know that the decision rely on the combination that be review when the sentencing calculation be do as say in my statement will return in month to update the house we want to remove this temporary measure as quickly as possible and we will be transparent throughout the shadow lord chancellor will not need to chase around this building try to find out what be happen as have to when be in his position and we be consider the previous government early release scheme we will be transparent in way that the previous government simply be not we will do quarterly release of all the datum and we will update the house regularly be sure that the right hon gentleman follow the announcement on friday closely so he will know that the announcement on probation do not involve new money it be re prioritisation of resource because strengthen probation to make sure that it be in the strong possible position to deal with the early release scheme be incredibly important to we on dartmoor the right hon gentleman know the history very well safety be our no priority and after close monitoring of the situation at hmp dartmoor it have be decide that prison will be temporarily close will update the house as the situation develop say to he gently that we have commit to year capacity strategy we recognise that we need to make sure that this country have the prison place that it need we will deliver where the previous government fail and we will never allow the planning process to get in the way of have the prison that we need in this country long term however we will also look at drive down reoffende because the entrenched cycle of reoffende create more victim and more crime and it have big impact on our ability to have the capacity that we need in our prison estate that be why this government will make it key priority to drive down reoffende that be strategy for create well citizen not well criminal it be strategy for cut crime and in the long term it will deal with our capacity problem for year to come welcome my right hon friend to her place on the government front bench the imprisonment for public protection prison population be more than of those people be over tariff and more than prisoner be now year over their original tariff can she accelerate the ministry of justice refresh ipp action plan to help to reduce the prison population and right that wrong thank my hon friend for that question the situation with ipp prisoner be of great concern and know that huge number of member on both side of this house care about it deeply share that concern ipp prisoner be not catch in the change that we be put forward those be indeterminate sentence not standard determinate sentence we support the previous government in what we think be sensible change to the licence period and the action plan and we will continue that work however any change make have to account for public protection risk first and foremost we want to make progress with that cohort of prisoner but not in way that impact public protection call the lib dem spokesperson also welcome the lord chancellor to her new position and thank she for advance sight of her statement it have be apparent for month that measure of this sort would be necessary these be describe as temporary measure but month be very long time for temporary measure there would be real danger of damage public confidence in our criminal system if the measure be to be extend beyond that point the answer surely have to be more than just build more prison capacity the problem be not that our prison estate be too small it be that we send too many people to prison and that the time they spend there do nothing to tackle the problem of drug and alcohol dependency poor literacy and numeracy skill and poor mental health which lead to their incarceration can we hope to hear in the very near future the government comprehensive plan to tackle the issue of the time that people spend in prison finally may bring to the lord chancellor attention the report publish this morning by his majesty inspectorate of probation on the failing of the cambridgeshire and peterborough probation delivery unit that report outline that our duty of care to those whom we lock up should not end the day they leave custody when will we have response to that report welcome the right hon gentleman to his place on the month period we have inherit criminal justice system in complete crisis and at risk of total breakdown and collapse it will take some time by necessity for we to be able to put that right do not want to mislead the public that somehow these change will have quick effect the system be in dire strait and it will take time to repair it it be right that we be up front and honest about that time and will update the house regularly as say this government approach will be very different from that of the last government we will have regular release of datum and anticipate that will regularly appear before member to talk about that datum but welcome that opportunity because it be important that the public be keep update and that their representative in this place be able to scrutinise what be happen and hold we to account we will need time for the measure to take effect to enable we to move the system to position of great health in term of who go to prison why and for how long when we have overcrowded prison there be no capacity to do much other than hold people in their cell the activity that we know be important to help people in the prison system to turn their life around come out as well citizen and make well choice have make amend to society can not happen in deeply overcrowded prison that be why deal with the capacity crisis be so necessary not just to prevent the collapse of the criminal justice system but to cut reoffende in the long term create some space will allow we to introduce proposal to bring down reoffende rate in the country on probation pay tribute to all probation staff for their tremendous work my first visit in my new role be to meet probation staff in bedfordshire recognise that they have be work in system and service under extreme strain and face real difficulty that be why we will onboard new trainee probation officer before march to add extra capacity and why return the probation system to health will be key priority for this government declare non pecuniary interest be an honorary life member of the prison officers association in seek to be fair as she always be my right hon friend be be too kind on the last government they bring about staffing crisis in our prison that have bring rehabilitation to an end and level of violence that we have never see before will she bring forward as soon as possible workforce strategy for our prison and probation as matter of urgency will she look in particular at feltham young offender institution which have become violent emergency for staff and for prisoner themselves my right hon friend be right take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the staff in our prison who do an excellent job under very difficult circumstance he be right to acknowledge that the level of violence in our prison have be increase place those staff at ever great risk this be similar to the question that just answer on probation when prison be so badly overcrowded it be incredibly difficult to run any kind of regime that can do good work on rehabilitation or provide safe atmosphere for the staff who work in they will of course have conversation in the usual way when it come to discussion about the spending review and other measure that the chancellor will bring forward hope that need not tell my right hon friend that will bat hard for our department and the people represent that will all happen in the usual way we be committed to publish our year capacity strategy as quickly as possible so that we can begin the process of return our system to some sort of health thank he for raise feltham will look at that and write to he listen very carefully to the lord chancellor comment about members present and past who have legitimate concern about new build prison proposal in their constituency she will no doubt be aware of the proposal for new mega prison in buckinghamshire on farmland adjacent to hmp spring hill and hmp grendon those proposal be deeply unpopular in my constituency first on fairness ground they be affect community just one mile from the construction of which be already under siege from big construction and secondly because the prison in buckinghamshire can not recruit to the vacancy that they already have fully staff brand new prison be just not go to happen so ask the new lord chancellor to do my constituent the courtesy of sit down with so that she can hear why this particular proposal just will not work thank the hon member for his question may gently say that this be part of the problem be not go to get into the specific of his particular constituency or those particular planning proposal those proposal be already within the planning system as the shadow lord chancellor the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar allude to in his remark but prison have to be build in this country we have to do more building we have to do it more quickly and we have rightly say that we will always treat prison as of national importance that be actually change bring in by the previous government to unlock the delay that they have face for many year particularly when concern be raise by their own members of parliament we take too long to build any kind of infrastructure in this country that will not be the approach of this government so while be very happy to consider any proposal that any member of this house have about specific in their constituency the reality be that prison will always be deem by this government to be of national importance and they will be build first congratulate my right hon friend on her new post and thank she for reassure we that this scheme will not apply to sexual violence domestic abuse and stalking that will really reassure survivor in my constituency will she review how the scheme will affect those with learn disability who be in prison without support and ensure that there be good communication with local council on the housing of ex offender with early notification that be not on friday afternoon welcome my hon friend to her place this change be design in part to allow probation to do the job that it would normally do when it come to prisoner release on licence we will have an eight week implementation period that be one of the big difference between this scheme and the previous government end of custody supervise licensing scheme which be pretty chaotic and opaque thing move very quickly not allow probation the time to do its job be not go to pretend that the eight week be ideal but it be well than where we might have be it allow the sentencing calculation to be redone and some planning to then happen in the normal way so that we can make sure that when those people be release into the community they have proper release plan in place once we be into the prospective element of the change believe that the process will be much smooth and probation will be able to do much more effective job of manage those prisoner as they be release into the community diolch yn fawr iawn llywydd the secretary of state be entirely correct to say that prison be in crisis they have be in crisis for year and reform be urgently necessary it be evident that there be many people in prison who should not be there but that be the only place that they can be people for whom community base prevention and rehabilitation would be way well the last government promise we woman residential centre base in swansea but accord to an answer to my write parliamentary question early this year delay and uncertainty over planning see that proposal sideline will the new labour government commit to succeed where the last government so obviously and appallingly fail and facilitate the establishment of woman residential centre in wales where we have no woman prison thank the right hon member that be very compelling bit of lobby from she may offer to meet with she so that we can discuss this issue in person welcome the secretary of state and her team to their place can the secretary of state comment on what be report in the guardian early this week apparently the former director general for propriety and ethic write to the previous prime minister tell he that failure to act on the prison crisis would bring the criminal justice system to point of critical failure do she agree that if this be true that be an enormous dereliction of duty by the conservatives thank my hon friend do read those report in the guardian of course none of we have have sight of any of those paper if those report be true it be very worrying indeed as say in my opening remark do not use the phrase the guilty man lightly when speak about the crisis we have inherit and the change we be be force to make believe it be serious dereliction of duty by the previous government could hardly believe the state of the prison system that inherit and think we have be force to make the change that we have because of that failure welcome the lord chancellor to her post just want to push she slightly on the description of this scheme as temporary scheme whatever she may say the legislative impact of what the government be do will be permanent change if she want to be subject to scrutiny and to have temporary scheme there be absolutely no reason why she can not sunset the legislation to be genuinely temporary change and come back later if she think she need to reintroduce it that be way to welcome scrutiny and be true to what she say about its be temporary scheme it be temporary scheme we will revert to the usual level as quickly as possible think month be the right period for to return to this house the hon member will have many opportunity to scrutinise these change because this government will be different from the previous government because we will be transparent all the way through anticipate many moment in this house when will be challenge it be temporary change it will always be temporary change have have many constituent place in prison because of fail mental health service when the crisis team do not turn up and there be no capacity in secure accommodation will the secretary of state have urgent discussion with the secretary of state for health to make an assessment of those people who should be in mental health service rather than in the criminal justice system my hon friend be right that we have broad failure across many of our public service include within the health service as my right hon friend the secretary of state for health have say we have inherit an nhs that be break will have conversation with he on the matter that she raise but it be important as we try to return the prison system to health that we do so in conjunction with the other public service that we know be crucial to the proper functioning of the criminal justice service can welcome the lord chancellor to her place and wish she well in the very important role she now have it be imperative that when judge sentence criminal consideration of fulfil justice prevail more than consideration of space in prison how will the lord chancellor address the difficulty to ensure that justice and serve an appropriate sentence will remain the focus the logistic of that can then be deal with the hon member be right in the end individual sentencing decision be for judge they have discretion to apply the law as they see fit in the circumstance of the case in front of they and nothing that we have decide change that picture more broadly we will have sentencing review it be something we commit to in our manifesto and will say more about that later in the year to make sure that all our sentencing be consistent and coherent and that our sentence do actually work which be what they be mean to do welcome the lord chancellor to her place she have certainly hit the ground run in very difficult backdrop from the previous government we know only too well that often prisoner be release on friday afternoon with little or no access to statutory service and they become homeless what assurance can she give the house that this have be think through and the unintended consequence of this decision will not be extend the homelessness crisis the implementation period that we have put forward in our proposal will allow the probation service time to prepare as have say before that be different from the early release scheme bring forward by the previous government it will allow the probation service to do its job and ensure that there be proper plan for all release into the community so that they be successful release be sure that my hon friend will know about the community accommodation service which provide transitional accommodation for up to night for those who be at risk of leave prison homeless that will continue the previous government scheme release prisoner with little or no warning this scheme be different it give probation time to prepare and should hopefully iron out some of the previous problem congratulate the lord chancellor on her appointment as have be mention reoffende have be major problem drug and alcohol rehabilitation service be at premium and need look at but another key factor be ensure that when prisoner leave prison they get job what work be be do to ensure that there be more employment opportunity for those who be leave prison my hon friend be absolutely right as say early employment be crucial because we know that if those who leave prison be in work within year of leave prison they be much less likely to reoffend that be why one of our manifesto commitment be set up employment council in our prison bring together prison governor and local employer to make sure we be do everything we can to drive down rate of reoffende we will have more to say on that in the come week and month associate myself with the comment of the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts because the woman residential centre she speak of happen to be in my constituency the lord chancellor will be very aware of the current issue in parc prison bridgend pay tribute to the very hard work of my hon friend the member for bridgend chris elmore and to the previous welsh affairs committee the previous government blame the local culture of the community for the issue that be arise in bridgend certainly find that insulting there be also an issue regard staff there and the intimidation that they and their family have face will the lord chancellor reinforce and support those in the prison and probation service who work in parc prison bridgend and work particularly with my hon friend the member for bridgend to ensure that the culture in the prison change and people be safe would be happy to meet both my hon friend and the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts individually or together to talk about the woman prison and to write to they on that point in relation to parc also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for bridgend chris elmore would be happy to work with he and other hon member with an interest be deeply concerned about the situation at parc prison and pay tribute to the staff who work there as have say many time be in absolute awe of the effort make by staff across the prison and probation service who keep our system system which have be in dire strait go under extreme pressure will happily meet hon member to discuss parc but it be situation that be already monitor closely congratulate the lord chancellor on her new position be sure she be go to do an amazing job the law on joint enterprise need urgent review thousand of young black man be incarcerate for long prison term for crime they have not commit will my right hon friend state how and when she be look to undertake review of that law of course joint enterprise be not relate to the change we be make today but know that it be an issue of real concern and interest for my hon friend and other member across the house as understand it the crown prosecution service be already review the evidence it be right for that to conclude before the new government set out any measure but will be engage closely with the cps on its review congratulate my right hon friend and those on the front bench on their appointment we in norfolk be lucky to have in sarah taylor police and crime commissioner who be stand up with integrity and honesty just like our new government and be open what work will the secretary of state be undertake to ensure that police and crime commissioner in norfolk and around the country be be support in the work they need to do police and crime commissioner be crucial to help we to manage the current crisis and as we move the system to some health hopefully soon rather than later have meeting with many police and crime commissioner while in opposition have already meet the lead representative for the pcc on the criminal justice board and that have already meet to talk about how we make these change in the safe possible way will continue engage in that way welcome the lord chancellor and her team to their place on the front bench far to the question from my hon friend the member for southgate and wood green bambos charalambous be expand this scheme to include unfair indeterminate sentence not worth further consideration that would provide an additional potential early release welcome my hon friend back to her place be well aware of the issue around indeterminate sentence for public protection know that matter be of great interest to member as it be to as constituency member of parliament know this territory well it would not be appropriate to make change in relation to ipp prisoner because there be different order of public protection risk be determined to make more progress on ipp prisoner as say we will build on the work do by the previous government we work constructively with the previous administration on sensible change that could be make in the safe possible way for the public those change be on the licence period and the action plan which we will crack on with as new government any change that we make to the regime for that type of sentence which have be rightly abolish must be do while balance the public protection risk which we would never take lightly clean energy superpower mission before call the secretary of state note that there be disappointment from the opposition that the statement be not provide in time the statement be not provide to my office in time either know we want to set off in the right way be sure that the official will make note when they arrive that we need to make sure that statement be provide on time that be mean to be four minute past the hour be sure that the secretary of state will want to ensure that it never happen again with permission would like to make statement about the government mission to make britain clean energy superpower this government be elect two week ago since then we have lift the onshore wind ban in england which have be in place since consent more than gw of solar project power the equivalent of almost home establish the mission control centre in my department under chris stark to plan and deliver our mission and establish under the chancellor national wealth fund to create good clean energy job across our country we be just get start we be move at this pace for one overriding reason the urgency of the challenge we face we have the challenge of our energy insecurity lay bare by putin invasion of ukraine and pay for by the british people in the bad cost of live crisis in generation we have the challenge of an economy that do not work for work people with too few good job at decent wage we have the challenge of the climate crisis not future threat but present reality this government have drive philosophy homegrown clean energy can help we tackle all those challenge include crucially energy security today the climate change committee publish its progress report to parliament thank the interim chair piers forster and the interim chief executive james richardson for their excellent work the committee say in its report british base renewable energy be the cheap and fast way to reduce vulnerability to volatile global fossil fuel market the fast we get off fossil fuel the more secure we become it be right that be why make britain clean energy superpower be one of the five mission of this government deliver clean power by and accelerate to net zero across the economy today the committee report also lay bare the truth about the last government despite achievement which be happy to acknowledge the report be coruscate about the lurch of recent year it say that last year the previous government signal slowing of pace and reverse or delay key policy it go on the announcement be give with the justification that they will make the transition more affordable for people but with no evidence back this claim it conclude that the country be not on track to hit our international target of emission reduction indeed it say our assessment be that only third of the emission reduction require be currently cover by credible plan that be our inheritance for target to be achieve in just five year will respond formally to the committee in the autumn and as part of that have ask my department to provide with thorough analysis of its finding but can tell the house today that we will hold fast to our clean power mission and our nationally determine contribution because it be the right thing to do for our country today set out our next step first onshore wind be one of the cheap source of power that we have to those in the house who claim they be protect community with the onshore wind ban let we be clear they have undermine our energy security and set back the fight against the climate crisis that be why in the first hour of this government we lift the ban which today confirm formally to the house under the onshore wind ban the pipeline of project in england shrink by over year ago the last government net zero tsar chris skidmore whom pay tribute to make recommendation of an onshore wind taskforce to drive forward project the last government ignore it we will implement it the taskforce will work with developer to rebuild the pipeline of project secondly solar power be among the cheap form of power that we have my right hon friend the deputy prime minister and be determined that we have rooftop revolution we must use the rooftop of our country for solar far well than we do at the moment that be why the deputy prime minister and be clear that rooftop solar should play an important role where appropriate as part of the future standard for home and building the solar road map we have be wait for it for month will be publish soon with great ambition have reconvene the solar taskforce to deliver that objective as we face up to the challenge of the energy transition we must also plan for how we use land in this country to ensure proper balance between food security nature preservation and clean energy after dither and delay under the previous government the environment food and rural affairs secretary will publish land use framework work in tandem with our spatial energy plan also assure the house that community will continue to have say on any proposal in their area it be important for this government that where community host clean energy infrastructure they should directly benefit from it but we will not carry on with position where the clean energy we need do not get build and the british people pay the price credible external estimate suggest that ground mount solar use just of our land in the big threat to nature and food security and to our rural community be not solar panel or onshore wind it be the climate crisis which threaten our good farmland food production and the livelihood of farmer the government will proceed not on the basis of myth and false information but on evidence every time the previous government duck delay and deny the difficult decision need for clean energy that make we less secure raise bill and undermined climate action no more thirdly offshore wind will be the backbone of our clean energy mission allocation round oversee by the last government be catastrophe for the industry with no offshore wind contract award the upcoming round be critical test we will get this crucial industry back on its foot by the beginning of august will report back on the budget for to ensure that as much clean home grow energy as possible get build while ensure value for money our fourth step be the great british energy bill announce in the gracious speech be extremely proud that this be the first bill for decade that will enable we to establish uk wide publicly own energy generation company the truth be that there be already widespread public ownership of energy in britain but by foreign government we have offshore wind farm in the uk own by the government of denmark france norway and sweden through state own company those government know that publicly own national champion be part of modern industrial strategy and generate return for taxpayer crowd in not crowd out private investment for too long britain have opt out and lose out today we say no more great british energy headquarter in scotland will invest in home grow clean energy to increase our energy independence create good job with strong trade union and tackle the climate crisis it will invest in technology such as nuclear offshore wind tidal hydrogen and carbon capture and ensure just transition for our oil and gas community gb energy will also oversee the big expansion of community energy in british history through our local power plan the government believe in the ownership of british asset by the british people for the benefit of the british people follow the people verdict at the general election hope that this be patriotic mission that the whole house can get behind have see year of debate on climate and energy in this house the clean energy transition represent the big transformation of our economy for year and it be massively challenging we have be at our good as country and as house when we have work together for the sake of the national interest pay tribute to people of all party who have be champion of this agenda over the past year baroness may who legislate for net zero the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey who oversee the growth of offshore wind caroline lucas and on the labour benches my friend alan whitehead one of my early decision be to re establish the role of the secretary of state as the lead climate negotiator in my department because we can only protect future generation with strong action at home and leadership abroad next week in london will host the president of this year in azerbaijan he will be join by the president of and have invite the president of cop lord sharma who preside with such distinction to join our discussion this be sign of how intend to go on work with people of all party and none in this national endeavour that be what the british people have right to expect of we as the prime minister rightly say country first party second that be more true on this issue than any other this government will act at pace and work with anyone who share our mission commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state would like to put on the record my disappointment not to get the statement in good time know that the right hon gentleman will want to provide we with the same courtesy that we try to provide he when we be in government that be say congratulate he on his return to government be sad not to see more of he during the election campaign particularly because our ability to secure enough cheap energy will be crucial to this nation success in the decade ahead would also like to put on record my thank to the official he will now work with wish the right hon gentleman well in his endeavour but energy will be this government big test they talk good game on growth but the secretary of state energy policy be their great liability in government we build more offshore wind than any other country bar china we set out the large expansion of nuclear power in year we say that yes we will need oil and gas in the decade ahead as the climate change committee have say and we should use british oil and gas where need we be in global race for energy and demand will be high in the year ahead because of datum and artificial intelligence if the right hon gentleman plan to decarbonise the grid by be in place we need to know what they will do to people energy bill our energy security and our reliance on the current dominant player for cable battery and critical mineral china he be happy to quote the climate change committee but it also acknowledge that we will need oil and gas well into he must answer where would he like that to come from when it come to quote he should consider some from the business world who have comment on his policy such as the chief executive of mitsubishi power who say that his plan would require huge sacrifice by the country cite the cost of the secretary of state approach the chief executive of ineos say that his approach to energy be absurd leave we dependent on import of foreign fuel with high emission and do nothing for the climate even the gmb say that his plan be unviable and would lead to power cut blackout and enormous cost unite have say that the government plan for the north sea would turn oil and gas worker into the coalminer of their generation the right hon gentleman must answer why he would like to import gas with much high emission how many job will be lose from his plan how much investment into the new technology of the future such as hydrogen carbon capture and offshore wind will be lose will he meet those worker and explain to they what will happen to their livelihood during the election the right hon gentleman claim that he would lower bill and save family however those number be already in the saving and no one on his side can set out the cost of his plan to decarbonise the grid by who will pay for those network cost what will they do to people standing charge which be already too high the right hon gentleman also think comment on have say in term of community the energy infrastructure he will need and the fact that he want to go far and fast will have huge impact on rural community their concern must be address as set out the plan for our energy can not come at the expense of our food or national security in his statement the right hon gentleman accuse of dither but as he will know from his official in at least one of the case he have sign off have already instruct some time ago that be minded to reject it and that paperwork be be prepare he must set out urgently what his criterion will be in one case he overturn an expert examine authority in another case he sign off solar farm which will be on our good and most versatile agricultural land do he know that be the case if so what be his basis for find that acceptable will he continue our effort to build more solar on rooftop think he mention that he would reconvene the solar taskforce hate to tell he but it have never be disband and we be due to publish that work so would like to know what date he will be able to publish that work in conclusion the secretary of state party win the election and promise change but he be not on show during that campaign to answer these critical question of how he be go to provide that change and what it will mean for the country what will his plan mean for the price of electricity what will they mean for our ability to keep the light on what will they mean for struggle family bill for our economy and for the livelihood of oil and gas worker what will they mean for our reliance on china for all that the labour government talk about growth they will not be able to deliver on that with the secretary of state plan for energy hope that in the month ahead he will set out some of that detail to be examine may start by congratulate the right hon lady on her recent engagement wish she and her fiancé all the good for the future we may disagree on some issue but believe this government and the right hon lady can at least share belief in long honeymoon laughter on the right hon lady response have to say that be disappoint the line be very very familiar that be because they be the line she have use for the last year and here she come today to the house and repeat the line as if the intervene meteorite have not hit the conservative party the bad election result in year for her party the truth as sensible conservative know be that the lurch she work on year ago with the former prime minister the leader of the opposition the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak be an electoral disaster for the conservative party the lurch away from climate action what we see in her statement be the classic dilemma for the conservative party which we will see play out hope for many long year of opposition the dilemma be do they go the reform route to be climate denier or do they actually re embrace order can just say that do not need any advice will decide whether it be question it be an answer actually on the point the right hon lady make there be fundamental issue which be that unless we drive for clean energy this be what the climate change committee say strongly recommend that right hon and hon member read it we will end up energy insecure we have the bad cost of live crisis in generation because of our exposure to fossil fuel both domestically and internationally set and sell on the world market unless we drive for clean energy we will end up pay more for energy the house would not know that from what she say about our target she have target when she be in government of clean power by of course target do not matter for the previous government because they be always mile away from reach they as for the north sea we set out our manifesto position which be not to issue licence to explore new field but to keep exist field for their lifetime here be the truth of the conversation that we must have the fate of north sea oil and gas community be define by these question do we drive forward the clean energy of the future have we plan for carbon capture and storage have we plan for hydrogen have we plan for offshore wind the conservatives have no such plan so we will take no lecture on just transition from they the right hon lady have other line that be rehearsal of the election let say this to she on the solar question she refer to one particular planning decision and do think she have degree of brass neck she criticise for overturn the planning authority be in quasi judicial role so will be careful about what say but she have this in her department for year she could have agree with the planning authority and reject the application but she choose not to do so that be the reality in my experience when you lose general election period of reflection be in order and say to conservative members that they need to reflect long and hard on the signal that they send in this election their climate lurch be disaster disaster for they electorally but much more important to disaster for the country under this government britain be back open for business and climate leadership it be great to see you back in the chair mr speaker it be also great to see the secretary of state at the dispatch box on this side of the house again welcome what he say about the job low bill energy security and climate action that lie at the heart of this government plan that be very true in respect of the liverpool city region where offshore wind as he say will play an important and increase role in our energy future along with onshore wind solar power hydrogen carbon capture and nuclear energy however we also have exciting plan for tidal energy in the region and hope he can confirm that it will form part of what he want to achieve through the plan that he have announce my hon friend have long be an eloquent advocate for the role that business can play in generate the clean energy of our future and generate prosperity can absolutely confirm that we want to embrace the wide range of technology obviously we must ensure that that give value for money but what always say on these occasion be that the climate crisis and the energy security challenge be so big for we as country that we must embrace every form of technology at our disposal because that be the only way in which we will succeed rise order may just gently say that these exchange must finish at pm hope we can help each other along the way but first call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome the new secretary of state to his place share his passion for climate action let add however that next time he make statement we will need our copy in well time than be the case today there be no doubt that the good route to affordable energy be renewable but under the former government renewable project face long delay and cost have skyrocket indeed that government record on renewable be absolutely miserable our electricity demand be expect to double by and we must make upgrade our grid infrastructure major priority the government will know that one of the big challenge will be to bring community behind host the big infrastructure change need for the grid expansion and to cope with the huge landscape transformation how will they secure public consent as the secretary of state say to achieve our legally bind target we also need rooftop solar revolution which will include introduce strong incentive for household to install solar panel and ensure fair price for energy that they sell back to the grid will the government work on those incentive with the liberal democrats we liberal democrats acknowledge the new approach take by this new government and look forward to work constructively with the secretary of state to achieve our very ambitious target may welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker welcome the hon lady question we work together on these issue when we be in opposition let deal with her two substantive point on the question of public consent this be absolutely something that we need to do and see it in three way first community need say secondly community need benefit community be provide service to the country when they host clean energy infrastructure so there need to be benefit for those community thirdly this be debate that we will have to have and be afraid the last government do not grasp the nettle on this issue we be go through massive change in our economy if we do not build the grid or roll out solar we will be poor as country and we will absolutely expose ourselves to future cost of live crisis look forward to receive as much support as possible from the liberal democrats and indeed from all member of this house in make the case to people we have to go out and make the case as think happen in the when we will build the grid if we do not make the case we will leave ourselves expose as country and it be the british people who will pay the price completely concur with the hon lady on rooftop solar welcome my right hon friend back to his position on the front bench and particularly welcome his reference to hydrogen know he have be to visit itm power in my constituency when will an announcement be make about the choose two technology to pursue with small modular reactor will he give an assurance that whichever firm be pick they will have to ensure that very high percentage of the smr be build in this country by uk firm such as sheffield forgemasters in my constituency that will create well pay job as well as clean energy definitely concur with what my hon friend say about itm power an incredibly impressive company that have visit also concur with he on the smr programme our manifesto make it clear that we support new nuclear include at sizewell and we also support the smr programme part of our challenge be to examine the legacy leave to we by the last government but he should be in no doubt about my absolute support for the smr programme it be important and we will strive to keep to the timetable set out welcome the secretary of state to his role but he have be quite political in his reply gently point out that in west worcestershire few people vote labour in this election than in the last election or the one before wonder whether he have ever visit the beautiful landscape of west worcestershire the malvern hill and bredon hill be some of the most treasured landscape in our land what parameter be he go to put around the building of pylon wind farm and solar farm across that beautiful landscape thank the hon lady for her question as with any planning decision there be clear parameter in the legislation on the consultation that need to take place with local community gently point out to she that nine year ago the last government ban onshore wind in england for some of the reason that she set out think that be mistake at the time and it turn out to be even more of mistake than think because it expose we to energy insecurity we have to make judgment as member of this house give the scale of the climate crisis the energy insecurity and the energy security threat that we face do we believe that we need to build infrastructure happen to believe that we do yes with community consent yes with community benefit and yes with the planning rule that have set out congratulate the secretary of state on his new position he be lucky enough to visit my constituency during the election campaign and to visit the port of greenock where he see the great potential that exist for inverclyde and renfrewshire west to contribute to the government clean energy mission what plan do he have to ensure that every part of the country include in scotland can make contribution what message do he have for my constituent who be look to the government to make an investment in our port and our marine asset my hon friend be an incredibly eloquent advocate for his port which be delighted to visit during the election campaign he make such an important point for an island nation look to take advantage in term of job as well as generation of the opportunity of offshore wind include float offshore wind our port be massively undervalued and under invest asset that be why in our manifesto we set out the large public investment in port since privatisation my hon friend be absolutely right to say that it must involve the whole of our united kingdom scotland have special place in that as it will become the new headquarters of gb energy in the last parliament be lucky enough to be the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on deep geothermal feel that we make good progress in convince the government of its merit in help the climate change transition will the new secretary of state commit to meeting with the rea the association for renewable energy and clean technology which act as the secretariat for the appg and to see what more we can do to convince the new government of the role that deep geothermal can play in the spirit that speak about in my statement may congratulate the hon gentleman on his work on deep geothermal it be an outstanding example of how members of parliament can advance the role that particular technology can play he be most eloquent advocate for this technology among the many place go during the election campaign have the chance to see deep geothermal in cornwall which also have the potential for lithium mining it be source of critical mineral between and the new minister for energy the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks who be go to be very busy man we will make sure that we meet the hon gentleman and his colleague to take forward this agenda in line with the cornwall thread call jayne kirkham cornish port such as falmouth which the secretary of state visit during the campaign have well advanced plan to reconfigure to service float offshore wind in the celtic sea cornish further education provider be keen to gear up to provide specialised course to support the speedy growth of that industry so that young people in cornwall have the opportunity to train for those high skilled job of the future but in the past they have struggle because of lack of government support will the secretary of state please confirm that support will be available to port business and educational establishment in cornwall to enable they to plug into the vast opportunity open up by float offshore wind in the celtic sea congratulate my hon friend on her election may say that she be great person to go out on boat with and that very much enjoy our tour my hon friend make such an important point about the celtic sea and about the opportunity that we have one of the decision on my desk will be how we make sure that we advance float wind technology and that we manufacture it in the uk as tim pick the offshore wind champion often remind the large float wind prototype be off the coast of scotland but it be not manufacture in the uk we need to change that call llinos medi diolch dirprwy lefarydd thank you madam deputy speaker the labour manifesto state that build new nuclear power and small modular reactor will be important in develop new clean power yet in the king speech yesterday there be not single mention of nuclear power can the secretary of state assure that develop new nuclear power be still priority of this government what be the specific plan for the wylfa and trawsfynydd site in wales welcome the hon lady to her place great british energy will of course have strong interest in nuclear power work with great british nuclear it be very important for the future this government be very clear in our manifesto about the role that nuclear power both large scale nuclear and smr can play know that the last government purchase the site for wylfa and it be something that we will certainly be look at welcome my right hon friend to his place and congratulate he on his ambition bioyorkshire be project green new deal to create green collar job and upskill worker it will also create hundred of spin off and new start up company focus on chemical agriculture and new generation of fuel will he ensure that his department have early engagement with this green new deal for york and north yorkshire will he ensure that that be part of his energy superpower for the future be grateful to my hon friend for draw this project to my attention in way the question from both side of the house demonstrate the huge potential we have in this area not just to tackle the climate crisis and energy insecurity but to create the good job of the future undertake that the department will want to look closely at her project what assessment have the new secretary of state make of the proposal to build an interconnector between morocco and the uk to bring clean solar and wind energy that could potentially provide of the uk grid requirement thank the right hon gentleman for his question certainly take an interest in the project when be in opposition have meet xlinks the company involve need to be careful about what say on these matter as he will appreciate but it be certainly project that my department will want to consider thank the secretary of state for his statement he have already show more ambition and leadership on transition away from dirty energy in his day in government than the tories show in year do he agree that by make the uk clean energy superpower we will be able to tackle air pollution which kill more than people year in manchester alone that be the kind of question like my hon friend make serious and important point about air pollution which be another reason why we need to move away from fossil fuel in sense the tragedy of air pollution be that it be silent killer ten of thousand of people year die prematurely in our country as result of air pollution people would be out on the street if it be any other issue but because it be silent killer it be too little noticed he be absolutely right that this be yet another reason why it be important that we act with speed and transition as fast as possible be conscious that we do not have register of interest at the moment so for the secretary of state own protection it might be helpful if he could tell the house whether he accept any donation or otherwise during the election campaign that might be declarable want to press the secretary of state far on protect the landscape eighty per cent of my constituency be in an area of outstanding natural beauty now rebrande as national landscape can he reassure that in their planning decision he and the secretary of state for housing communities and local government will respect the notion of protect landscape there be series of solar farm application in my constituency some of which be either in or impinge on the area of outstanding natural beauty the landscape be protect for reason and it be important that the government respect those protection in planning law hope he can confirm that that will be the case on the right hon gentleman first question be proud to have be support by the gmb and the union of shop distributive and allied workers during the election campaign think the sum be below the declarable limit but be very happy to put that on the record as constituency mp understand local people concern about planning issue and we have to take those concern seriously we know that not all planning application be good and that be the government position at the same time particularly in the light of what the national infrastructure commission have say it be widely recognise that how the planning process work have delay the clean energy we need and have make we poor as country this government be determined to change that thank the secretary of state for the constructive manner in which he and the government have approach the vital issue of the grangemouth refinery which be crucial to life in my constituency can he confirm that the uk government will be tenacious and resolute in seek an industrial future for the grangemouth site will he agree to meet to discuss potential option for its future pay tribute to my hon friend for be such an eloquent advocate for grangemouth so early in his time as member of parliament his counsel advice and work on this subject have be very important have have three conversation with my counterpart in the scottish government over the last two week which be sign of how we intend to continue we will work across party and across government to do all we can the future of grangemouth really matter to this government and we will leave no stone unturned in work with the union the company and the scottish government to do everything we can to secure viable future for activity on the site and for the community of grangemouth after the king speech and this statement we still do not have clue about what gb energy will look like the government can not even tell we where it will be place other than within the square mile of scotland greg jackson the boss of octopus energy have say that if we reform this absurd energy market through some form of regional pricing structure everybody in the uk would have cheap bill and scotland would have the cheap energy in europe will the secretary of state look at that and ensure that he deliver that prospect for everyone in these isle be slightly disappointed but not surprised by the hon gentleman tone would have think that the scottish national party would welcome publicly own energy generation company locate in scotland my counterpart in the scottish government certainly welcome it let we be absolutely clear that it will be generator of energy that be what company such as ørsted and statkraft do they own power in this country and we will do the same these be complex question and we definitely need fairness across the united kingdom when it come to energy price that be what this government endeavour to deliver congratulate my right hon friend on his appointment and welcome he back to government my constituent and indeed all our constituent have suffer the bad cost of live crisis in generation thank to the conservative party be in thrall to fossil fuel interest and fail to invest in renewable do the secretary of state agree that we need publicly own domestic energy champion that can speed up our transition to green energy reduce our reliance on volatile international gas market and cut household bill at the same time my hon friend have be an incredibly eloquent advocate on these issue include in the last parliament this be an important point for all party in the house to reckon with the energy insecurity case for action on clean energy be totally transform from when be energy secretary year ago why partly because russia invasion of ukraine remind we of what exposure can look like but it be also because we have see fall in the cost of solar and fall in the cost of offshore wind over the last decade the old argument that this energy will save we money in the long term but might cost more in the short term have change this be the cheap clean form of energy we can access there be submission from interested party against the sunnica application in west suffolk and the technical report recommend against the application be page long have the secretary of state visit the sunnica site how many hour do it take he to read all the submission and evidence to make his own detailed technical and legal judgment to overrule they anyone who know know that be super nerd take all of my responsibility particularly my quasi judicial responsibility incredibly seriously and do in all the judgment make my hon friend will find it nice refer to my right hon friend as the secretary of state and thank he for his statement his action over the last few week underline the damaging inaction of the past year the ccc report out today confirm the true extent of the tories climate denialism and the way in which it have undermine our ability to deliver on so many important aspect of this agenda do the secretary of state agree that no less damaging than climate denialism be the climate delivery denialism to which member in certain part of this house be now start to fall back can he confirm that this government will not shy away from some of the tough choice that will have to be make to deliver not only the climate agenda that voter have support but the energy security we desperately need thank my hon friend for his important question he draw attention to fact in the climate change committee report that be worth underline we have an internationally set nationally determined contribution of reduction by compare to level however the climate change committee say this morning that only third of the emission reduction require be cover by credible plan that be the legacy we have be leave be determined that we meet those target which be why we have to speed up and act in way that the last government do not my hon friend be right about clean energy as say early this be debate that this country will have to have we can say no to clean energy and to building grid but that will leave we poor and more exposed and mean that we be not do what be require to tackle the climate crisis this government have make their choice other will have to do so too welcome the secretary of state to his post welcome the tone of his statement and share its ambition will he join in commend the ambitious work of lib dem lead oxfordshire county council which want to reach net zero by and the work of all council everywhere they be on the frontline of the climate crisis in our community he talk about local people have say do he agree that often the good way for local community to feel they have that say be through their local council characteristically the hon lady make an important point to deliver this agenda we have to get the central local relationship right because if we try to deliver it all from the centre we will not succeed to take the example of improve the appalling state of energy efficiency in our home much of that work will have to be deliver by local authority that be the right way to do it and pay tribute to all the local authority across the country that be show ambition in that area congratulate the secretary of state on his appointment the cities of london and westminster have huge contribution to make for the uk to be clean energy superpower not just through investment drive from the city of london and innovation drive by business across the constituency but through our residential community energy scheme such as aldgate solar power which be fantastic local co operative however after year of dither and delay by the conservative government and the former conservative council the pimlico district heating undertaking be in desperate need of investment will the secretary of state meet to discuss how we can make it an exemplar scheme and mitigate the cost for local resident and leaseholder who may be face significant cost because of the nature and construction of the heating equipment congratulate my hon friend on her election have work with she in the past and know she will be an outstanding member of parliament the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for rutherglen be go to be very busy but be sure he will happily meet she to discuss her question she raise community energy scheme want to emphasise that one thing great british energy will deliver be our local power plan which will work with local community and local authority to deliver community energy one of the answer to the question of how we build public consent for this be community ownership of energy we want to drive that forward and that be what the local power plan will be about congratulate the right hon gentleman on his appointment the decision that the government have make will see much more rapid decommissioning of oil and gas in the north sea how much additional money have he secure from the treasury to cover the government legal cost for that decommissioning and how much do he think it will cost in total the most important thing be to secure just transition for those community as set out in our manifesto through billion from great british energy and over billion from our national wealth fund the truth be that there be massive debate in the house about licensing the right hon gentleman will not have be at the debate when we discuss these issue but the difference it make to how much of our gas demand be produce domestically be that under the old let explain under the old government policy there would have be reduction in our demand meet domestically but under this government policy it will be for all the hue and cry from the opposition that be the reality welcome the secretary of state to his position cornwall be one of the most deprived area of northern europe however we be bless with vast renewable energy resource as mention early onshore wind offshore wind geothermal tidal solar and ground source heat technology as well as critical mineral not from china but from camborne and redruth will the secretary of state meet and cornish colleague to discuss how gb energy will be use to realise our renewable energy potential and to transform local cornish economy my hon friend be also great guy to go on boat with as he say cornwall and our coastal community have an incredibly important part to play some of the big economic challenge we face as country be in our coastal community it be not easy but if we get this right it will be massive opportunity not just for cornwall but for all our coastal community and that be what this government intend to do call jim shannon oh thank you you catch off guard there madam deputy speaker because be so used to be the last one in the house to be call welcome the secretary of state to his place know it have always be his ambition to have the opportunity to have this role now he have it hope it go well for he and we will support he in what he be try to achieve with the new government come new way of achieve goal and aim represent strangford which be mostly rural constituency farming be way of life and key part of the economy it create thousand of job and opportunity and be key to our future green energy and net zero be important for that as well will the secretary of state confirm that the farming community and agrifood need will be paramount in any effort to achieve well world for all of we to live in thank the hon gentleman for his kind word in the last few day have sometimes to people that feel that be go back to the job do year ago but get to try and do it well be sure member on the opposition benches would agree with that it be an amazing opportunity and big responsibility the hon gentleman make an important point about the role of rural of community particularly farming community we be determined to get the balance right between food security nature preservation and clean energy the truth be that we as country have not think about the role of our land enough in recent year we hope that will be drive by the land use framework that will be produce by my right hon friend the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs welcome the secretary of state and his team to their place he will know that my constituency have benefit hugely from offshore wind particularly in operation and maintenance but the critical part of the supply chain have fail to be produce what do he suggest that member across the house can do to ensure we get the supply chain right so that my constituent can benefit from that investment welcome my hon friend back to the house it be fantastic to see she back in her place congratulate she she know much about this subject through work for renewableuk when she be outside the house and she make an important point the shadow secretary of state draw attention to our generation of offshore wind which we have do well but it be commonly accept that we have not do nearly so well in generate the job that should come with that part of what will be do with my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade be develop proper green industrial strategy include in the supply chain that will provide clarity about the plan to ensure that we have not just energy generation but job generation too welcome the secretary of state to his role and welcome the government recognition that public investment must play substantial role in decarbonise power have see that from my previous career in offshore wind however this public investment must not be only about de risk private sector investment though some of his colleague have imply that that would be the principal role of great british energy will the secretary of state confirm that great british energy will invest in fully publicly own or at least majority publicly own renewable generation project and will not confine itself to take minority stake in private sector lead project that would give it very little control welcome the hon lady to her place can confirm that gb energy will play role in all kind of way and that we be certainly not restrict it in the way that she suggest furthermore in the constructive spirit of these exchange would ask that the green party think about its commitment to tackle the climate crisis which we all share and then think about this question of infrastructure if it want to tackle the climate crisis it should know that that simply will not happen if its lead member say no to new energy infrastructure too welcome the secretary of state to his place it be very appropriate that he be bring this level of energy to the debate and we all hope to see much more of that in the year ahead it be big contrast to the previous year of inaction which have cost we not just in term of our energy security but in waste opportunity wish to touch on one of those opportunity which be the huge tidal power potential that britain have in swansea and not just in sefton do he agree that it be time to seize that opportunity rather than waste it welcome my hon friend to his place he be head of policy when be leader of the opposition and tend to do what he tell rather than the other way round so it be particular pleasure to see he in his place he make such an important point tidal be an area where britain be in the lead but we want to go far and fast as it have huge potential for our country welcome the secretary of state to his place but have to say that the government disastrous decision to industrialise our highly productive good agricultural land by approve three huge solar farm clearly demonstrate their unwillingness to listen to the concern of local rural community it run roughshod over they and their ability to have their say it be also hugely detrimental to food security can he explain to the house how he will look the farming community in the eye and explain his decision as well as the government lukewarm word on food security be national security be afraid that we have to conduct these debate on the basis of fact not myth some of our land and around that amount of agricultural land be be use for solar panel we can not proceed on the basis of myth the hon gentleman talk about the farming community farmer want this the national farmers union have support this decision of course we will work with local community but every time an opposition member get up and oppose clean energy they be say to the british people we be go to make you poor we be go to make britain more energy insecure and we be not go to tackle the climate crisis thank the secretary of state for set out his very clear strategy will he confirm whether project such as the new hydrogen hub in bradford will be at the forefront of that strategy will he guarantee proper investment in place such as bradford so that we can grow and become global leader in this sector as well as generate well pay and sustainable job really welcome my hon friend advocacy on this issue the hydrogen economy be really important part of our future it be yet another example of where we can succeed as country and generate good job and good wage look forward to engage with he on these issue may take the secretary of state back to the question of tidal power generation if he speak to the developer in the sector they will tell he that they need two thing to keep grow the sector they need an expand pot for the ringfenced allocation in the next allocation round and they need an ambitious deployment target for the sector can we have an early announcement on that if he really want to understand the potential of marine renewable he need to get himself up to the european marine energy centre in orkney he be very welcome there at any time but he might want to come in the summer while the day be still long thank the right hon member for that invitation and will very much consider it because care lot about this area obviously have to make decision in certain capacity about allocation round but have hear what he have say welcome the secretary of state and his excellent team to their new role can look forward to welcome they back to whitelee wind farm which he have be to many time before to see how the large onshore wind farm in the uk be contribute not only energy but to the community and its life declare an interest as the outgoing chair of the uyghur campaign in the uk the secretary of state will be aware that much of the polysilicon use in solar manufacturing be source from the uyghur region where uyghurs and other turkic muslims be routinely use as slave labourer the expansion of solar that the secretary of state be envision give we enormous economic leverage in the uk and wonder how he intend to use that leverage to get the industry to clean up its supply chain and seek alternative source of polysilicon let welcome my hon friend to his place he raise very important issue there be some standard put in place by the previous government but think that we should take this issue incredibly seriously look forward to discussion with he on these issue the secretary of state speak very passionately about gb energy remind he that just few year ago the labour control nottingham city council have its own energy company call robin hood energy but this be robin hood with modern twist it rob from the poor and give to the rich and cost the taxpayer about million can the secretary of state tell the house from that dispatch box how much gb energy will cost the taxpayer first of all let explain to the hon gentleman that robin hood energy be supply company this be generation company robin hood be retailer so it be different but have to say that be surprised at the position that he take think his party be in favour of publicly own energy think it produce lot of video on social medium to that effect the secretary of state know from his recent visit to my constituency just how important energy security be for the people of newcastle under lyme be just sorry that there be no boat over year of the tories family bill have be push up and we be leave at the mercy of putin after his invasion of ukraine may urge the secretary of state to get to work quickly follow his excellent return to the job he be the comeback kid so that we can cut bill and give my constituent the energy security that they deserve think to be call kid at my time of life be stretch thing bit but be nevertheless grateful to my hon friend for his contribution he make the important point that huge opportunity exist right across our country the united states have use the inflation reduction act to seize those opportunity our economy be small but we intend to seize those opportunity with proper modern industrial policy welcome the secretary of state to his place somerset be home to many ground mount solar farm development although fully support the significantly increase amount of electricity that we generate from renewable believe that the community that host the infrastructure should receive compensation the government recent policy statement on onshore wind agree with that so will community benefit fund be mandate for new solar farm development the hon lady raise an important issue the previous government have whole series of consultation out on community benefit we will respond to those but want to be very clear that believe that when community take on the responsibility of host clean energy infrastructure it should benefit from it welcome my right hon friend to his role and welcome his ambition during the general election campaign so many resident in knowsley tell that they be struggle with the cost of live crisis and rise energy bill can the secretary of state confirm that great british energy will allow we to take back control of our system give we energy security and crucially low bill for family let welcome my hon friend to her place and congratulate she on her election she will be great member of parliament she raise such an important issue more than million people be in fuel poverty in our country one thing that this government will do that the last government do not be demand that landlord raise the standard of their accommodation to proper energy performance certificate standard by that will make dent in this issue but the house should be in no doubt about our ambition to cut that number of million as much as possible in the five year of this parliament plan for mile of pylon from lincolnshire to my north west norfolk constituency and new substation be strongly oppose by local community will the secretary of state commit to review of network technology and consider presumption in favour of underground or offshore proposal will look at all proposal but think the hon gentleman know that underground cable cost six to time more that be why the last government do not agree to report september vol correction if part of our challenge be to cut bill for people that be not sustainable solution for the future be sympathetic to all mp who raise issue on behalf of their constituent but gently say again to he that if we want to avoid repeat of the cost of living crisis if we want to tackle the climate crisis and if we want energy security we will have to build the grid in our country welcome the comment of the secretary of state which be incredibly encouraging for community such as mine in west wales throughout the campaign hear again and again the demand from local people from pembroke dock to milford haven for well pay secure job in the industry of the future in the port of milford haven we have huge opportunity particularly in the area of float offshore wind will the secretary of state meet to discuss the opportunity for my constituency and how we can overcome the barrier to investment in local job be delighted to visit the port of milford haven during the election campaign there be an interesting issue here the billion investment that this government be make in our port will hopefully allow we to invest in float offshore wind at more port than the last government be able to can not make promise about particular port from the dispatch box but this be so important because if we be to get the job here we must invest in our port infrastructure the secretary of state refer multiple time to community consent yet the acre of solar installation in the constituency of my hon friend the member for west suffolk nick timothy have no community consent that send shiver down the spine of my constituent in and around the village know as the claydons who be look down the barrel of acre solar installation call rosefield that be on top of propose battery storage plant next door and on top of the national grid want to build brand new substation to take the thing in it be the tail wag the dog what will change to make community consent reality what the hon gentleman want for nationally significant project be community veto indicate assent the hon gentleman nod his head will be honest with he we be not go to give community veto the last government do not give it either there be nationally significant project that the government have to make decision on obviously we have to take into account the view of local community but the whole point of decision making on the nationally significant infrastructure programme be that we look at the need of the nation as well that be why community benefit be important if we ask local community to host clean energy infrastructure sometimes they will not want it or sometimes minority will not want it be not make presumption in this case and then we should ensure that those community benefit from it welcome the secretary of state and his team to the chamber it be privilege to make my first contribution in this house on such an ambitious plan it be ambitious not just on net zero the climate crisis and energy security but on job and opportunity for young people in place such as mine in my constituency peterborough college be already build green technology centre to develop new green apprenticeship and we have plan for clean energy transition centre will the secretary of state put on record his commitment to work with trade union community college and other so that we can move from blue collar to green collar apprenticeship and give young people an opportunity to succeed in life as we meet our climate and energy need welcome my hon friend to his place he raise the important question of how we ensure this issue will be familiar to member across the house that we not only have the capacity to generate job in clean energy but can meet the skill need of the country in order to fill they this be frankly something on which we need to do lot well as country my department will talk about this in the next few week will take on more of function around look at the skill need of the clean energy economy work with the department for education on how we meet they he raise crucial point in that context congratulate the secretary of state and his team on their recent appointment and thank they for their recent visit to cheyne court wind farm in my constituency which be open by the secretary of state in dungeness and dungeness in my constituency be former nuclear power station that be in the process of be decommission dungeness have the land infrastructure grid connection and local expertise that make it well place for new nuclear will the secretary of state be willing to meet to discuss how we can harness dungeness potential for the local area and the regional community be delighted to visit the cheyne court wind farm with my hon friend wind farm that open year ago on my first visit as the secretary of state picture of how much have age between then and now be available on request he raise really important issue he be an important advocate for clean energy whether in relation to wind power or the potential nuclear programme both be important to we congratulate the secretary of state on his position and on the vigorous start that he have make on this most important of issue face humanity and the world be particularly encourage to see he put climate diplomacy high on the agenda and at the heart of the new cabinet that be so important after year of the previous government denigration of britain role in the world on this most important issue of tackle climate change will he far outline to the house the work that he plan to ensure that unlike in the past year britain will be the main player that it need to be in global co operation on tackle the threat of climate change be pleased that my hon friend have ask that question the world want to see british leadership but british leadership start at home with the power of example if we do not show that we be act at home then people say you tell we one thing abroad but do something different when it come to your own domestic situation the truth be that in azerbaijan and crucially in brazil will be very important moment be when the world have to come to term with how far off track we be from and put in our nationally determined contribution for look forward to britain play as much of constructive role in those negotiation as we can welcome the secretary of state to his place teesside be perfectly position for the green job of the future job in hydrogen clean power and port as my right hon friend know from his recent visit to teesport will he meet and colleague to ensure that we can bring job and investment to teesside my hon friend who welcome to his place make such an important point about the role teesside can play see on recent visit how much potential there be and we look forward to work with he on these issue welcome my right hon friend and his team to their place he have the privilege of visit basingstoke college of technology during the election campaign to meet some of the fantastic apprentice and student there far to his answer to my hon friend the member for peterborough andrew pakes will he commit to work with college such as bcot as he develop the plan for skill and training for the hundred of thousand of job we need to deliver on our ambition of clean energy superpower thank my hon friend and welcome he to the house he bring wealth of knowledge and experience on these issue enjoy my visit to basingstoke what really come home to on that visit be young people enthusiasm for this agenda not simply because they care about the climate crisis but because they see this as potential future for themselves their friend and their family look forward to work with college such as his to make that reality it be great to see my right hon friend in his place after over decade of leadership on this issue talk about climate change and really make that difference if we be to be clean energy superpower we need to learn from good example and well practice wherever it be in calder valley together housing be good example of housing association that be do well in put solar on roof and take advantage of microgeneration however be sure he will agree that one problem for those kind of project be that the national grid be not up to scratch key to be clean energy superpower be get modern national grid will he also agree to visit some of together housing project which keep bill down and put solar panel on roof welcome my hon friend to his place and congratulate he on his election and commend his housing association for what it be do he raise one of the big issue that the previous government face and that this government face the flipside of all the conservative members say that they do not want the grid build be what my hon friend just say maybe they should have conversation what he be say be that if we do not build the grid we can not get the clean energy and we can not cut bill for our constituent do not say that this be easy and do not want to pretend that it be certainly the last government do not find it easy but we have to decide to govern be to choose and our choice be that we believe this clean energy infrastructure need to be build last week bracknell forest council hold climate change summit bring together local business school and community organisation in my constituency to engage in discussion about how good to face the challenge of climate change do the secretary of state agree that community be cry out to take part and to be engage in the clean energy transition again congratulate my hon friend he raise an important point that we have not touch on the role of citizen in this change my sense be that while of course there be specific planning issue that people raise about their own community the view of many citizen in our country be what can do what difference can make think the government need to do well job of answer that that be not nanny statism to reassure the conservatives but public information about the difference people can make in this incredibly important cause last but not least call laurence turner as recent official of the gmb trade union which have be mention in this statement welcome the secretary of state and his team and official to their place how welcome it be to have change of government from the record of the last year with the ducking and delaying of difficult decision on issue from nuclear to gas storage and the exclusion for too long of worker voice from the decision that affect the energy system in opposition my right hon friend establish an energy transition working group to bring together trade union and worker voice at the heart of energy plan can he confirm today that continue that group in government will be an early priority for this new administration welcome my hon friend to this house and thank he for the work we do together in opposition on all these issue as this be the final question he end on really important point this government have completely different attitude to the role that trade union can play in the future of our energy system and we be proud of it if we be to make the energy transition include in the north sea and build proper industrial policy for the future we should do what every other self respect nation do and have trade union at the heart of our policymaking and decision making that be what this government will do congratulation everybody on get through that be delighted that everybody get to ask their question and thank the secretary of state for his response point of order on point of order madam deputy

serve alongside the former members for berwick upon tweed and macclesfield who be very sorry be no long sit alongside on the front bench they be both superb ministers who work diligently at the foreign office can not recall more perilous period in international affair enter the house of commons just two year before the momentous fall of the berlin wall which precipitate the demise of the soviet union and the consequent end of the cold war it be difficult to overstate have live with the terrifying spectre of nuclear confrontation the collective relief we all feel yet the world be once again in the grip of gallop escalation of tension and danger where the international institution create on the heel of the second world war to defend our value and protect mankind be be undermine the narrow nationalism that so disfigure our continent be once again rear its destructive head and despot and dictator increasingly ride roughshod over democratic freedom and the rule base order putin brutal and illegal invasion of ukraine have bring war once again to the european continent the israel gaza conflict be devastating and risk regional conflagration poverty and debt stalk the global south yet covid teach we that no one be safe until we be all safe while climate change be the great existential threat of our time never have we face danger so grave when our fate be so closely entwined so at the very time when we need an international rule base order to tackle these common threat climate change migration terror and pandemic we be more fragmented than ever division be harden and debate be coarsen be very grateful to the right hon member my constituency neighbour for give way and be delighted to see he in his place on the opposition side of the chamber can take it from his remark that he subscribe to the view that we need not only rule base order but right base order here in our country and indeed in europe the framework for those right be the european convention on human right be we to take it from his remark that it be the policy of his majesty loyal opposition that we should remain member of the echr that be certainly the policy of the opposition and hope it be common across the house that we should remain part of the european convention be talk about division harden and debate coarsening public discourse be increasingly vitriolic be it in pursuit of single issue cause or broad agenda from the left or the right or drive by motif that may or may not be religious and may or may not be well intentione the challenge this present to british foreign policy be immense but britain have punch above its weight precisely because of our leadership role in the international system as his majesty opposition our role be to hold the government to account but also to give the strong possible support where we can hope that we can work constructively as our two party have do hitherto in opposition we will continue to make the case that britain must be force for good that it be outward look and global in perspective that we stand up for internationalism and co operation that we stand against populism and isolationism and that we stand with the world poor and most vulnerable be very proud of the conservative party record in government on all those front we stand firmly behind ukraine and we work day and night with international partner to maximise the flow of humanitarian aid into gaza while support negotiation to secure the release of the israeli hostage we produce groundbreaking white paper on international development which draw in the support of all political party in tackle global poverty in complex geopolitical environment be grateful to the shadow foreign secretary for his comment one duty of the opposition be to point out blind spot we be talk about security but one thing that be not mention in the king speech be food security for rural community like mine which have an agricultural base food security be really important we have see the attack on ukraine and the grain come out of it what can my right hon friend do in opposition to hold the government to account to ensure we have food security on these isle my hon friend be quite right about the importance of food security he will remember that the then prime minister launch the global food security summit last november in britain food security be an issue not just for we but as my hon friend rightly say all around the world and we will continue to press the government to take it as seriously as we do would like to expand on some theme that anticipate will remain dominant over the course of this parliament first turn to ukraine britain work in support ukraine be shin example of cross party co operation pay tribute to the labour party for the constructive approach it demonstrate while in opposition the government can rely on we to continue in that spirit because the struggle in ukraine be an existential issue let no one believe that putin will stop at ukraine if he be victorious in this struggle our support for ukraine in the face of putin brutality remain unwavering and know that the government position be the same we welcome the government keep in place the commitment we make to spend at least billion year on military support for ukraine for as long as be necessary in government we be also lead advocate for sanctioned russian asset be use to support ukraine and for ensure that russia pay for the destruction it have cause urge the new government to push the international community to coalesce around the most ambitious solution possible to achieve those important aim we on the opposition benches welcome the declaration agree at the nato summit in washington last week to which the defence secretary refer which commit to support ukraine on its irreversible path to full euro atlantic integration include nato membership it be right that the government also commit to this in the gracious speech in relation to the middle east we want to see the conflict in gaza come to sustainable end as quickly as possible our view remain that negotiate pause in the fighting be the good way to secure the release of the hostage enable significant scaling up of much need humanitarian aid and help bring about the condition that will allow for permanent end to hostility that be the plan that britain champion in new york and which secure the consent of the international community at the un there be deal on the table to achieve those goal back by israel the united states and the united nations security council the onus be now on hamas to accept it and bring to an end the suffering of the palestinian people and the hostage who remain in such awful jeopardy the government must build on our hard work to see aid reach those in gaza who desperately need it the conservative government treble their aid commitment in the last financial year and do everything possible to get more aid into gaza by land sea and air israel have commit to increase the amount of aid reach gaza and the government of israel must be hold to account for deliver on their promise want to signal note of caution which link to my comment early about composure be acutely aware of the very strong feeling that the conflict in gaza have elicit it be probably the most polarise foreign policy issue of our time which have play out on the street of our country on our university campus and in our politic even form the entire basis for some candidate in the general election who be now with we in the house of commons we must remember that this remain an incredibly complex issue the question and challenge around resolve the current conflict and achieve the two state solution that we all want to see be profoundly difficult we have responsibility to set sensible and respectful tone in the many debate we will continue to have and to make clear that there be no room in our democracy for threat of violence and intimidation we require serious solution and long term measured policy not performative politic or short term symbolic proclamation we should certainly recognise the state of palestine but it must be at the right time as part of an overall solution to do so prematurely could send signal that terror pay urge the government to resist the siren call of those who wish to demonise the state of israel and who draw moral equivalence between the hamas leadership and the democratically elect government of israel in bid to isolate and delegitimise it while we be all appal at the dreadful loss of life in gaza we must never forget the horror unleash by hamas on israel on october the deadly terrorist attack in israel history to which the defence secretary rightly refer the conservative party stand four square behind israel right to defend itself but it must be in accordance with international humanitarian law we must not lose sight of the fact that this be at its heart tale of two just cause of two people legitimate aspiration for national sovereignty security and dignity there be other crisis around the world that must also preoccupy the government refer particularly to the crisis that have engulf sudan now the bad displacement of people anywhere in the world we be see clear evidence of ethnic cleansing once again in darfur we urge the government to continue our effort to pressure the war party in sudan to cease hostility and to push hard for humanitarian support to reach those desperate people include those see on the border with chad early this year the government must also continue to hold to account the regime around the world commit appalling act whether that be iran myanmar north korea or russia where we must push for the immediate release of vladimir kara murza finally know that the foreign secretary will want to work closely with the government of gibraltar and spain and take hand on approach to secure good deal for the rock future prosperity we will also be follow closely the very important negotiation over the future of diego garcia turn briefly and directly to the gracious speech in spite of their legitimate desire for yet another defence review think the government have make mistake in not honour immediately our commitment to increase defence spending to of gdp by my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge the shadow defence secretary will say more about the matter later but would say now that this give the wrong signal to our ally and adversary about our determination to confront the multitude of danger the world face in the conservative government make the commitment to spend of gdp on defence the uk lead the way and many nato ally have follow and we have now lead the way with our commitment to move to of gdp by the government should be in no doubt either that we will place under the microscope any decision that they may make on our nuclear deterrent on the subject of europe we welcome the close possible partnership with our friend and neighbour subject to respect the result of the referendum and the will of our constituent over brexit today most important summit at blenheim serve up oven ready by my right hon friend the former prime minister be chance to underline the effective way in which the uk have work with our european partner in response to the invasion of ukraine and show that although we be outside the eu we can indeed work together effectively the upcoming commonwealth heads of government meeting which be delighted be reference in the gracious speech will be an opportunity to show real ambition for the commonwealth in government we offer strong support for samoa hosting of chogm and its desire to use this platform to enhance commonwealth country resilience to global challenge urge the new government to continue work closely with samoa to make the most of this chogm and to mobilise action across the commonwealth include to boost trade and investment and enhance access to climate finance wish to conclude by address an issue that be very close to my heart and the heart of many other across the house but which in many way link all these theme together be privileged to return to government as the minister for international development brief hold previously in as secretary of state for many in their dark moment after flood earthquake and disaster britain have be beacon of hope and light now million people be fall back into poverty million of girl be out of school famine stalk the land of east africa and child be starve to death the anger and frustration of the global south be palpable make no secret of my dismay that the overseas aid budget be cut and that the department for international development be merge into the foreign office my job as deputy foreign secretary be to look forward to try to make the merger work after tumultuous start and to set out pathway to return to however development be about much more than money our recent white paper craft new approach that reflect the change world around we we formulate creative way of mobilise new and additional fund to ensure that the sustainable development goal can get back on track be proud of the leadership that our former prime minister have show on the green climate fund and the global fund where britain be right at the forefront of ensure that those fund improve and be fully replenish hope that the new government will do the same with the international development association world bank replenishment and with gavi we make the case that international development must be own by the british people submit that that be not conservative labour or liberal policy but british policy and we must all unite behind the goal of bring the british people behind the agenda set out so clearly in the white paper all british development money be spend in our national interest because it help heal the grotesque discrepancy of opportunity and wealth that disfigure our world we will continue to stand up for the world poor and most vulnerable call for the continue reform of the international financial system to free up funding for climate finance debt relief and achieve the sdg we will continue to stand up for woman and girl with the same vigour that we exhibit in government whether in relation to female genital mutilation woman right or lgbtq right and we will press for bolstering of the cop mechanism of country on the frontline of climate shock finally we will be keep close eye on whether the in fcdo fall silent once more development be only as effective as the structure and expertise behind it try hard in office to strengthen the development silo in the foreign office with some but frankly not enough success stress in the strong term that development can not be sideshow as people life depend upon it but the foreign office system be build around diplomacy with panoply of resource focus on the foreign secretary priority hope that the government keep that in mind development deserve the attention and energy afford to diplomacy with the right strategic adjustment development and diplomacy could make for mighty partnership but it will require proactive leadership if despite good effort that can not be achieve under the merger that will become clear soon rather than later during this parliament will urge the government to move swiftly and decisively to plan it be easy to despair at the state of the world so hope to end on more sanguine note be long enough in the tooth to have live through the ebb and flow of different era conflict and crisis have witness the bad in humanity but also the good have learn that the bleakest moment offer the great opportunity however history teach we that most thing do not come to an end but be bring to an end we have the power to change thing for the well and to build safe and more prosperous world but we can not do it alone only international co operation can deliver the progress we seek sincerely

it be badly in need of love ten year ago have stroke while be of all place at the labour party conference recover but be sad to say that do miss the leader speech of my right hon friend the member for

stroke the care that receive from an irish neurologist work for nhs north west london be fantastic so applaud the investment that labour be make in reduce nhs waiting list and double scanner for quick

by similarly welcome my arrival look forward to serve all my constituent and will start by back the much need change that they vote for that be set out in the king speech may start by warmly congratulate the new the hon member for ealing southall deirdre costigan for time live in acton close to her constituency and when she speak about the diversity and warmth of the area certainly recognise that have no doubt that she will be an enormous asset to this place many congratulation and welcome also welcome the secretary of state for defence and his team to their place and the foreign secretary and his team to theirs they include my fellow oxford mp the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds it be wonderful to see she there also welcome the shadow defence secretary the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge and in particular the shadow foreign secretary the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell whose promotion hope we can all agree be long overdue under boundary change oxford west and abingdon have take in dalton barrack and shippon so be now also the mp for number of armed force family pay tribute to they and to all our armed force and their family who so willingly give their life over to service to this country be very pleased that foreign affair and defence have be choose as the theme for the second day of the debate we be live in world that feel so much less stable and less secure than it have ever feel certainly in my lifetime only few day ago we see the horrific attempt assassination of an american presidential candidate putin continue to wage war in ukraine xi jinping continue his muscular foreign policy aim threaten taiwan and continue to oppress people in hong kong and xinjiang and as have be mention rise tide of populism be sweep across europe the liberal democrats support many of the priority set out in the king speech support for nato support for ukraine and reset our relationship with the european union be all vital to achieve security and stability we aim to work constructively with anyone in government who seek to return britain to its position as lead light on the international stage in particular in the area of development on which associate my remark with those of the shadow foreign secretary we agree that there be huge opportunity we want return to spend on development and we think that new department be the way to ensure the muscle that be need to give that oomph nevertheless we wish all the ministers well in their endeavour to find place for development in the foreign office be especially pleased to hear mention of the middle east and the two state solution for reason that be sure be obvious that be what will focus my remark on it have be nearly day since the horrific hamas attack on october since then hostage have still not return home the death toll in gaza have reach the vast majority of the dead be woman and child there be of course thousand more under the rubble who be leave out of the statistic scientist fear that the death toll will soar letter in the medical journal the lancet predict that if we take into account indirect casualty of war people who die of malnutrition lack of medication and unsanitary living condition the total number of death could climb as high as the child of gaza have suffer the unimaginable alexandra saieh the head of humanitarian policy and advocacy at save the children international say they be be dismember they have be burn alive in tent they have be kill due to crash apartment building block they have be also kill by preventable disease and illness and deny medical assistance child in gaza be just suffer horrifically in the first three month of this conflict alone child have one or both leg amputate that mean more than child lose one or both leg every single day we need that immediate ceasefire we need it six month ago there be only one way to end the killing to get those hostage safely home and to get that humanitarian aid in none of that can happen until the ceasefire be achieve but we must also understand that ceasefire be not enough for peace peace be not just the absence of war it be hope that be share hope for future in which palestinians and israelis live in security and dignity that be what we mean by two state solution that be the real prize have be relieve to be liberal democrat during the last few month in all seriousness when my family be under siege in that church in gaza the professional and the personal collide completely get the devastating news in november that have lose family member my cousin texte to tell and all they ask for be that ceasefire that be what the liberal democrats have consistently argue for because when it come to foreign policy we ground our approach in liberal principle of human right and the international rule base order congratulate the hon member on powerful speech agree with her call for an immediate ceasefire do she believe that we should also halt arm supply to israel which be be use to bomb gaza and make we and the united states complicit in the killing of so many people in gaza thank the right hon member for his intervention will come to exactly those point and will expand on they an approach base on the international rule base order and humanitarian law lead to our be on the right side of the argument on apartheid in south africa on hong kong and indeed on the war in iraq it guide our approach now be pleased delighted even that the government have include reference to the all important two state solution in the king speech and be very much hearten by the their change in tone but word be meaningless without concrete action it be vital that we start to think about what we need to do the day after that ceasefire be secure because at some point it will be we all know that hamas be extreme in this debate but so be netanyahu neither want peace it be in neither of their interest it be the framing of one versus the other that have prove to be so insidious in this debate there be plenty of voice in israel palestine and beyond who be partner in peace and be actively call for it protest in israel be grow with demonstration hold in jerusalem and tel aviv clamour for deal to be do to bring those hostage home they often link that to ceasefire and the release of palestinian political prisoner such as marwan barghouti that wide movement for peace be grow want to tell the house about two friend of mine maoz and magen inon they lose their parent on october when hamas target their house with close range missile have be twice to netiv haasara once before and once since and see their house and their burn out car it be heartbreaking but rather than turn to hatred they choose instead to spend their whole life talk about peace because they do not want this to happen to anyone else family there be only one way to guarantee that peace and share future in they and in all those israeli peace activist grow movement see that share future this chamber and this government need to understand that people like maoz and magen be ember in nascent fire they need the oxygen of political support to survive and grow the same be true for palestinian peace activist hamze and ahmed who recently share panel with all of we child of the nakba but all of we willing to devote our future to stop the endless taking of life to avenge past we no long want to keep resurrect over and over again these be the voice that deserve to be amplify and this be the kind of rhetoric that hope we can all follow bring people together not seek to divide say that with some disappointment because in the remark of the leader of the opposition in response to the king speech yesterday he do not mention palestine at all only israel we can not do that we must understand that we can not have security and freedom for israel without security and freedom for palestine that be why the mention of the two state solution be so vital let we start with the basic two state solution need two state that be why we must recognise the state of palestine along border immediately without precondition have lay bill in every parliamentary session since be elect and will do so again some country have already take this step include ireland spain and norway just this may if the uk be to join they it would send powerful message to the israeli government that we be serious about two state something that netanyahu have reject it would also send message to the palestinian people who be desperate for hope that the international community in particular the uk with our long stand historical obligation to the region will help they achieve that future many will say and they be right that recognition be not enough one of the big barrier to peace be the illegal israeli settlement in the west bank in israel illegally seize sq km of palestinian land in the occupy west bank that be more than all the land it have take over the past year combine these settlement be illegal under international law they exacerbate tension and they undermine the viability of that previous two state solution we have call for individual violent settler who breach international law to be sanction be pleased that the then conservative government take some small step and sanction individual settler but urge the government to go far the liberal democrats have call for sanction to include ministers ben gvir and smotrich and the connected entity that provide support or enable those extremist individual since we have also call for the uk to ban trade with illegal settlement because if they be illegal under international law we should put firm marker in the sand to come to the point make by the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn the trade of british weapon need to be handle with great care our policy be not to single out israel that be important our policy be build on ensure that no british make arm be sell to any country that be in potential breach of human right law that be why we believe that we should look at our arm export trade with israel despite repeat call the government never release their own legal advice on potential breach of international law in this conflict but give that there be case to answer at the icj and the icc the british public deserve to know whether the government be breach their own arm export regime the foreign secretary when he be shadow foreign secretary ask for that legal advice to be release be curious to see whether he will make good on that promise while we be on the subject of court it be vital that the uk government give their full throate support to the icc and the icj in their investigation and judgment the uk government must support they and their process and outcome without fear or favour that go beyond this conflict as there be international ramification if we undermine those court that be the bedrock of our international rule base order when in government the conservatives undermine those process but have hop for well from labour and still do in january the now foreign secretary say that his party believe that if an arrest warrant be issue for netanyahu they would honour it since then karim khan at the icc have issue one for hamas leader and netanyahu but we understand from the medium that the block by the uk which should be remove may have remain in place it would helpful for the foreign secretary to come to the house and explain the position as ever the hon lady be powerful advocate on injustice all over the world the particular point she raise on the international rule base order be very powerful it and the international legal system must provide equal protection to all people and they must be free from double standard the minute those two thing do not apply the very nature of the rule base order be under threat could not agree more it have really concern how people perceive double standard between what be happen in this conflict and what be happen between ukraine and russa they be very different conflict as politician we have to bolster that international rule base order so that people have faith that injustice anywhere in the world will be put through proper process and determine be afraid to say that we be at risk not just this country but the us of undermine that system urge the government to take different approach will simply end by say that urge the government to go far and fast on two state solution would love to see plan for what they mean by lead would offer my service with pleasure because we need that two state solution with israelis and palestinians live side by side in dignity and security it be go to take much more than change in tone to get there it be vital to what we need to achieve peace not just in israel palestine but in the middle east and the region as whole call lee pitcher to make his maiden speech thank the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran like many of we find myself stand on the terrace here in parliament on my first day with my back to the stunning palace of westminster and

the isle of axholme thank you for put your trust in be your voice here in westminster be your voice in the constituency and together we will make difference it be real pleasure to follow the maiden speech of the hon member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher it be also great pleasure to have another yorkshire hammer in the house but let give he some friendly advice he might not want to have my neighbour the hon member for leeds east richard burgon sit behind he next time if the hon gentleman do give he any trouble he should just ask to compare their team european cabinet as the current leader of the uk delegation to the nato parliamentary assembly want to say something about defence in an ever change world hope there be not too much of pause in the defence review that have already take place and there have be some debate about that understand why new defence review be take place under new government but think it worth note that we have move to view of nato and the threat that it face we may well see change of administration in the united states and with any change of administration it take time to work out the direction that the new administration want to take do not feel as fearful as some about president trump return to the white house because during his last tenure he invest heavily in nato and do not undermine it we know that while his habit be to create great upset and make big statement the reality turn out to be somewhat different and he work towards build on that nevertheless this be something that will have to be consider what trump do succeed in do be get european ally to build their defence strategy and budget and we can not escape the fact that the demand on the defence of europe be grow and grow not just on land but at sea we know that russia have map the bed of the north sea it have map the fuel pipeline and the data cable and obviously the surface platform be at risk we know that the royal navy and our ally spend great deal of time counteract that and be proud that the conservative government establish huge shipbuilding programme the like of which have not be see for very many year it provide long term contract that allow the shipyard and the company to invest and crucially allow the royal navy to be the capable force that it need to be that must be key not just to the maintaining of maritime nation but to where the maritime interest lie in the world climate change have already be mention today an undeniable fact in that connection be the opening up of the high north and the north east passage another undeniable fact be that the russians have be rebuild and revamp basis along their northern shoreline and yet another undeniable fact be that the ukraine war that vladimir putin illegally start think he would be able to walk in and dominate that country in very short space of time have decimate his economy in the long run go to war will always decimate an economy but this war have decimate russia military cost it huge number of military personnel and have make putin reliant on other country such as china it be notable that before the ukraine war chinese vessel never really go into the high north but they do now because russia let they in tension will build in the high north and we have to be ready for it think we be ready for it we have take part in vital exercise in the area but that just go to show how vital the royal navy be it be of course also vital that we have function air force and that we continue with the procurement of russian jet try to violate our airspace certainly nato airspace on think daily basis and they need to be meet with confrontation nato be deterrent rather than an aggressive force but deterrence can only happen if those concern feel the consequence of the balance of power believe that nato be strong enough at the moment no other combine maritime force in the world constantly have at least ship patrol the sea that be what nato be able to bring together however it be vital that when we carry out the strategic defence review we analyse not just what we need in maritime term today but what will come in the future not just how we patrol the airspace today but what will come in the future we must also address the position of the army which have be under discussion for decade it be all very well to talk about hollow out the armed force and go for the low number of personnel this be in many way the post cold war dividend and that dividend have go as number of we warn that it would before the conflict in ukraine and it will not come back that lead to some tough choice there have to be honesty in the conversation about how much of our gdp we should be spend because it will add up to and that mean that the budget must be cut somewhere else be proud that we have the track to get to but as be try to ask in my intervention on the secretary of state if this review add up to more than it say this be what we need to be able to defend change the government spend that money we can not on one the hand say that we aim to get to rather than give specific date and on the other hand say we be go to have strategic defence review but what if it cost will this actually be achieve that be an important question the right hon member be make most interesting speech do he agree that the present size of the british army be militate against recruitment great many people who might be good in the army and have consider it as career option be say actually if could get another job might do well and that be very very dangerous recruitment have become big problem in the armed force especially now that unemployment be at historically low level one of my colleague say to recently that it be not officer but the rank who be difficult to recruit do not have an immediate answer on how we can change that but can say this in my short tenure as the procurement minister at the mod it become blatantly obvious within hour from look at the letter and write question on my desk that accommodation be one of the big issue face the service make no criticism of any of my successor or predecessor in that role for try to handle the issue of accommodation because quickly discover just how difficult it be want to make front load the capital expenditure budget priority in order to sort out accommodation but there be so many legal hurdle in the deal that have be do in the past that it become difficult want to put on the record that see service accommodation as defence capability and it should be treat like all other defence capability if we be ask our service personnel to go to war do we want the last thing they hear before they go on to the battlefield to be that their family be move out and go somewhere else because they can not live in such condition any more do we want the last thing our personnel on trident hear before disappear for four month to be leave go back to my family home with the kid we can live like this that mean it have become an issue of operational capability we need our highly trained and highly professional personnel to know that they be be look after which start with accommodation wish the government all success in try to grasp this issue and take it forward because it be exceptionally complex be look at the shadow secretary of state for defence my hon friend the member for south suffolk james cartlidge who be one of my successor know that he personally try very hard to sort this issue out and carry it forward know there be body of work take place but this be priority and need to be sort hope that the new minister for the armed forces the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard make good on the write question he submit on and may this year about accommodation and on the several question table by the now secretary of state they obviously recognise that it be huge concern and we look forward to find out how they will approach that as soon as possible will move on to foreign affair without shadow of doubt one of the most contentious issue in the previous parliament as well as outside and during the general election be the war between israel and gaza which have inflame passion on all side fear that the general election campaign show that some of the militant pro palestinian protester be step over the mark that do not apply to all pro palestinian protester there be very different set of people but be talk about the militant pro palestinian protester who seek to use fear and intimidation to try to achieve their objective mr deputy speaker have not give notice to the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips about what be about to say but it be not criticism so hope she will accept it as she point out in her acceptance speech it be one of the most horrific campaign she have ever be through nobody put themselves forward in democracy let alone for public service should have to experience what not just she but several other people experience do you know what most of they have in common mr deputy speaker they be woman female candidate in the election especially labour female candidate have the most horrific misogynistic abuse hurl at they over the issue of gaza and israel and we have to call that out everybody elect to this place be here as parliamentarian to speak up for the thing they passionately believe in and no one should ever dismiss someone passionate view about particular subject even if we ferociously disagree with they however it be incumbent on all of we to call it out when we see in what should be fair democracy people have their tyre slash be scream at and be intimidate which happen to woman especially if we want to have strong democracy we have to make sure that this house say with one voice that everybody who want to stand for parliament whatever their view have the right to campaign safely and put their view across as country we have fall long way behind that whatever anybody view we have to call that out be strong defender and supporter of israel believe that israel have right to exist and right to defend itself believe that close eye must be keep on whether international humanitarian law be be break if it be the people who be responsible must be bring before the court and prosecute the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran make very powerful speech and listen intently to every word she say her personal experience bring value to this house as she be able to talk about what the israel gaza conflict mean to she give that her family be on the ground who in this house do not want to see ceasefire we all want to see ceasefire but there be two side to the coin it be still hamas objective to wipe out the state of israel which we have to address we have to keep balance as the shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell say pogrom be launch on october and we must make absolutely sure that what happen on that day can not happen again this house have always push for two state solution but it can not be down to israel alone to make the ceasefire happen will carry on defend israel right to defend itself and maintain its security will also carry on defend international law and make sure it be abide by if it be not will hold people to account but the call for ceasefire can not just be on one side hamas have to release the hostage and give up their objective of wipe out israel and then we may be able to move thing forward call joe powell to make his maiden speech thank you mr deputy speaker it be great pleasure to follow the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke and the excellent maiden speech by my hon friend the members for ealing southall deirdre costigan and for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher it give great delight to address this house as the new member of parliament for kensington and bayswater doubt that for any of we the last seven week have be easy know that many hon member will still be catch up on their sleep after the campaign trail but have our twin bear in the first week of the general election campaign take

political party before country and self interest before community know that trust in government and politician have plummet as result but it do not have to be this way have spend my career work to make democracy work well in dozen of country around the world by support reformer in government to work with civil society to be more transparent more inclusive and more accountable and to deliver for people on the priority that they care about in kensington and bayswater that mean for example get grip on the dirty money in luxury property that still stain our community despite recent progress in legislation and despite the leadership that baroness hodge the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and many other have show on this topic we still have in our constituency one of the high number of anonymously own property register in tax haven with loophole allow autocrat and kleptocrat to continue shield their ownership many of those property sit empty hurt our local business and school and hollow out our sense of community agree that those that be freeze under sanction should be utilise as soon as possible so be determined to build on our kensington against dirty money campaign and continue advocate for london to end its reputation as the dirty money capital of the world and instead become the anti corruption capital of the world there be no bad example of what happen when government stop listen to people and when transparency and accountability be discard than what happen at grenfell tower over seven year ago seventy two people lose their life in an entirely preventable tragedy yet we still do not have truth justice and change for the bereaved survivor and affected community these be people whose life be change forever on june and who have have to wait far too long for justice and for those responsible to be hold to account in the come week the second phase of the public inquiry will report know that hon member here will join in look to those recommendation to ensure that tragedy like grenfell can never happen again warmly welcome the inclusion in the king speech of the duty of candour law for public servant applaud the effective campaigning of those affect by grenfell hillsborough infect blood and windrush and of other who have suffer because of an unacceptable defensive culture across many of our public institution hope we can look at further measure to ensure robust oversight of the implementation of the recommendation from those inquiry kensington and bayswater be special place make huge contribution to our national life in so many way my hope be that under this labour government we will become fairer place too build on our strength and address the inequality that have hold we back it will not be easy and it will not happen overnight as qpr fan have learn over many year to be realistic but we have an opportunity now to restore faith and trust in government and democracy and to restore our reputation internationally too rise order before call the next speaker may say that demand to participate in this debate will exceed supply if we carry on at such length do not believe in regulation prefer self regulation so my advice be that if member stick to about six minute each from now on we will not have to impose time limit what pleasure to have hear three such effective maiden speech commend the hon member for kensington and bayswater joe powell for survive not only the election but the birth of twin wish his family well wish the hon member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher happy birthday do not think that make speech in the house of commons on future birthday will have the same allure somehow regard virendra sharma as great friend in the house of commons never quite see he as mafia don but do see he as very effective operator all new mp and indeed return mp could learn lot from virendra about how to get thing do in parliament commend the new team at the foreign commonwealth and development office and the ministry of defence be particularly pleased to see the noble lord collins of highbury become an under secretary in the department have work closely with he on development relate issue over the past five year particularly as his co chair of the all party parliamentary group on nutrition for development lord collins champion those issue in opposition be confident that he will now do so within the fcdo along with the minister of state the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds whom congratulate on her appointment want to concentrate on international development although note that there be no specific mention of it nor any ambition to return to spend on it in the king speech commend my long stand right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell for his effort in the previous government not only do he bring his usual vigour and drive to his time as minister for international development but he stabilise what all the evidence present to the select committee on international development show have be chaotically manage merger of the department for international development and the foreign and commonwealth office whatever the right and wrong of the thinking behind the merger we can not pretend that it be well execute or that the randomness of some of the decision and the scale of the funding cut be not seriously damage to frontline programme and the uk reputation as reliable development partner thank to my right hon friend that be behind we listen to his warning about the need for plan although the last thing those deliver aid on the frontline need be the distraction and disruption of further organisational change in the fcdo however be sure that they want to know this government criterion and anticipate timescale for return to in opposition labour members rightly highlight the cut to the aid budget and the impact on that budget of spending on refugee in the uk but in government they need to put their money where their mouth be so look forward to hear some detail on that spending in the minister wind up speech if we be to make meaningful progress on achieve the sustainable development goal by the government should embrace the white paper publish by my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield it be well receive across the development community in the uk and internationally although it be understandable that new government might want to put their own bell and whistle on it hope the core objective of end extreme poverty and tackle climate change will remain along with the framework for do so assure my right hon friend that there be bell and whistle from across the house in the international development white paper indeed and see the white paper as an important part of build new consensus on development and of re engage the wide public with that agenda cross party approach be the good way to build public support for development and confidence that funding be be spend effectively which be legitimate concern of our constituent all of we in this place who care about development should set ourselves the objective of increase public engagement in the uk as should those who work in the sector in recent year too many non governmental organisation have go down an overtly corporate route and lose touch with their member and supporter who be often the most powerful advocate for aid in their community have listen to mr deputy speaker guidance think do not have time to go into detail on what think the specific priority should be but have co chair the all party parliamentary group on hiv aids and nutrition for development be absolutely clear that those must be at the heart of the government approach to international development the economist have highlight this week that spend on nutrition deliver the good outcome for the money spend as the government move forward on deliver the sustainable development goal which we seem far from achieve by hope that nutrition will be at the heart of the agenda and that the government will take the opportunity of the forthcoming nutrition for growth conference in paris to restate their commitment not just to nutrition but to international development it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell it be also pleasure to finally sit on the government benches with my labour colleague the view be so much well from here it be an honour to have hear such incredibly powerful maiden speech from my hon friend the members for ealing southall deirdre costigan for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher and for kensington and bayswater joe powell they have raise the bar it will be difficult for we to match they in my acceptance speech on election night speak about how the conservative austerity agenda have so badly damage this nation over year that agenda destruction of our public service and people income devastate community like mine so it be incredibly welcome to hear the king speech of labour government who will immediately begin to address those matter be particularly pleased to welcome the employment right bill in as shadow secretary of state for employment rights and protections be honour to accept the invitation of the then leader of the opposition now prime minister to chair taskforce that ultimately lead to labour green paper herald the new deal for work people for their hard work and dedication must thank labour affiliate trade union the non affiliate union the tuc and the then leader of the opposition office must also mention the expertise of my noble friend lord john hendy and the institute of employment rights who work on this agenda over many year and my staff karl hansen and eli machover it be right for we to take action to ban exploitative zero hour contract and to end the scourge of fire and rehire while we be at it we should pay attention to fire and replace it sack worker over zoom those concern have to be hold responsible for their despicable act be pleased to import from new zealand the concept of fair pay agreement be delighted to see my right hon and hon friend engross the proposal start with the introduction of fpa in the social care sector hopefully that will mark the full restoration of sectoral collective bargaining over year ago of our economy be represent by collective bargaining but now it be less than that must be correct there be great deal of work to do but the introduction of single status of worker will be transformative for the million of worker in precarious and fragile employment who currently struggle to make end meet and have no hope of plan their future all of that change with the new deal as we update trade union legislation we look forward to the repeal of the unworkable and ill advise strikes minimum service levels act and the trade union act elsewhere in the king speech very much welcome the two railway bills and the well bus bill have produce as shadow transport secretary the white paper set out labour plan for nationally integrate publicly own railway be delighted that the secretary of state for transport have be so quick off the mark in table the necessary bills place on record my heartfelt thank to the incredible dr ian taylor formerly of transport for quality of life for his great expertise and sheer hard work in progress the agenda on rail reconfiguration and the re regulation of bus it be right that we get on with establish great british railways under public ownership welcome lord peter hendy mention his brother to the role of railway minister which be undoubtedly an excellent appointment can not fail to mention that in my middlesbrough and thornaby east constituency we have some of the bad child poverty in britain the prime minister be right to say that the abolition of the two child cap be merely one lever for tackle the abomination of child poverty as all labour government be destine to do but the cap be undoubtedly the most cruel and draconian measure to be visit on low income household by the party in opposition hope that my colleague on the front bench will pull that lever as priority and abolish this grotesquely punish measure at the early opportunity we need serious approach to public sector pay restoration and outsourcing very much welcome the chancellor commitment to the large programme of insource in british history as well as the health secretary intervention he be do what his predecessor do not do meet junior doctor in an attempt to bring the dispute to an end we need to grow our economy but we can not shy away from the fact that our taxation system be grossly unfair trust that the glare anomaly will be address early on welcome the focus on devolution there be power that we want to take away from this place and give to our nation and region but my goodness that have to come with accountability transparency and openness sadly too often that have be lack and that must be address finally on foreign affair it be perhaps statement of the obvious but our foreign policy must be base on human right and adherence to international humanitarian law on gaza welcome the foreign secretary this week call for an immediate ceasefire for hostage to be release and for aid to reach the people of gaza but the question be how we will apply pressure to achieve these goal we must have clarity in number of area first urge the government to set out how they will use all the necessary lever to achieve the ceasefire include the end of arm export licensing secondly trust that this government can provide the house with early confirmation of the re establishing of direct funding to the united nations relief and works agency thirdly ask the government to clarify that they support the process that will prosecute war crime and that the uk accept the international criminal court jurisdiction over israel and have no truck with the nonsensical legal argument that israel be exempt from international law we have see that time and again do not think that anybody in this house be not shake to the core by the vision of that young man with down syndrome who have be attack by idf soldier be savage by dog and then bleed to death we have see such scene over and over and the justification that it be okay to kill people innocent child woman and man in the pursuit of military target be an abomination hope the foreign secretary will quickly clarify the new government approach to the early recognition of the state of palestine we need equality and fairness to resolve this crisis and it will not be resolve without the recognition of palestine there be so much in this king speech we have an awful lot to be happy about and lot of optimism pour from it there be much to do but we be indeed up and run call carla denyer to make her maiden speech be most grateful to you mr deputy speaker for call to speak in today debate good afternoon colleague my name be carla denyer my pronoun be she she and be very much look forward to get to know you all congratulate the hon member for ealing southall deirdre costigan for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher and for kensington and bayswater joe powell on their interesting maiden speech also want to take moment to honour the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran for her very compelling speech about the route to peace in gaza and israel look forward to work with all the newly elect mp and in fact everybody in this place in pursuit of well future for our constituent will return to the shape of that future shortly but first want to look back for moment and to thank the people of bristol central for make history and elect as the first green mp for the city and also as far as be aware the first bisexual mp for the constituency we be as city rightly proud of our first in do not worry will not be do every year the town of bristol be the first in england to be give the status of county in john wesley found the very first methodist chapel the new room in what be now the very heart of my constituency in the city become the first in the uk to be give the european green capital award in the city elect marvin rees and thus become the first major european city to elect mayor of black african heritage and what be widely agree to be banksy first large stencil mural the mild mild west be paint in in stokes croft in my constituency in fact it be on wall just around the corner from where first meet member of the green party meeting that rather change the course of my life unfortunately the history of bristol can not and must not be disentangle from the uk shameful and immoral history of colonialism and slavery voyage lead by merchant william weston of bristol be the first expedition command by an englishman to north america and rich bristol merchant finance more than slave voyage between and those ship carry over enslave africans from africa to slave labour in the americas blue plaque on the seven stars inn on thomas lane in the city centre mark how thomas clarkson an anti slavery activist together with the seven stars landlord collect testimony from sailor in that be use as evidence here in parliament these statement play role in the passing of the slave trade act which eventually lead to the historic end of the transatlantic trade in enslave africans bristol central hugely successful shed museum highlight the anti slavery movement alongside its exhibition about modern public protest include the bristol bus boycott and it hold the infamous now topple colston statue the exhibition point to the abolition campaign as the start of british tradition of society campaign for change today the city that have proudly call home for year and part of which be now immensely proud to represent here in parliament be begin to take responsibility for its history and continue to lead the way when it come to demand change like most of the other esteemed members make their maiden speech get the library note advise that my remark should not be politically contentious or critical admit to have struggle little with how to define that give that be here first and foremost to demand and create change on behalf of my constituent in slightly different shape version of bristol central elect its first woman mp can applaud that landmark moment though not lady apsley report radical right wing conservatism imperialist racist and antisemitic view or the fact that she apparently consider woman first and foremost as wife and mother she make her maiden speech to the commons from her wheelchair and it be widely report defied convention by make passionate appeal for the well treatment of disabled people that be one thing on which can agree with she though do not think that championing disabled right should ever be consider controversial hope that in this parliament it never will be nor do think that voting system that make every vote count be an especially controversial proposition so agree strongly with another of my predecessor stephen williams the first liberal democrat ever to represent what be then bristol west he use his maiden speech to call for as he put it radical electoral reform and for first past the post to be sweep away and replace with system of fair vote now be good moment to recognise the contribution to parliament make by my immediate predecessor thangam debbonaire include as shadow leader of the house pay tribute to her work on behalf of bristolians particularly in support of the city amazing creative industry as shadow secretary of state for culture media and sport and her groundbreake move to hold what be believe to have be the first ever constituency surgery for people on the autistic spectrum thank you thangam for your service to the city what unite all these thread be the idea of speak up for what we believe in regardless of whether other might find it contentious or whether we be swim against the popular tide as an mp be determined to fully honour bristol central history of do exactly that use my voice as force for good for real change and for real hope to create bright future for my constituent and for we all the kind of future that the king speech represent an opportunity to build that bright future depend on the government take bold action to tackle inequality and poverty through measure such as lift the two child benefit cap mass council house building programme and give council the power to keep private rent under control private rent in bristol have increase by over the last decade while wage have not even increase by quarter this be an untenable situation but one that around half my constituent find themselves in as private renter the bright future that talk about depend on defend and restore our public service from hospital to dentist school and youth service and it mean look to restore the uk reputation on the world stage this be reputation that have be sorely damage by brexit know that speak for the majority of bristol central when say that we must be open and active in our effort to rebuild strong link with europe and work eventually towards future where the uk can rejoin the eu it be reputation too that have be compromise by our government refusal to clearly condemn the israeli government disproportionate response to the horrific terrorist attack of october and in particular by the uk continue arm sale for use against palestinians in persistent breach of international law be clear that that must stop and be clear too that demand it should not be controversial finally it be reputation that have be seriously erode in relation to climate action as councillor be responsible for propose the uk first climate emergency motion in autumn another first for bristol know what the climate science require that we get do in the lifetime of this parliament as this critical decade for the climate march on the bright future we all want for our constituent and our country demand that we urgently secure liveable future our warming planet have just pass another milestone for the first time global temperature be above the crucial limit for an entire year hope this house will agree that that be one first that we all have responsibility to try to ensure be also last the last government seek to break the climate consensus to weaponise culture war and to spread lie and misinformation about what net zero future will be like this government must reverse the damage and have the courage to show genuine climate leadership at this critical time in our planet history will stand with the government if they do that but will not be afraid to speak up where think they might need to go little fast we have hear in the king speech commitment to clean energy transition and public ownership of public transport and hope more will be forthcoming across the week and month ahead of we stand ready to work across party line to help to secure the ambitious change we need for our climate and our natural world and to make the uk fair place in fact have already begin that cross party work so say big thank you to the hon member of other party and none who have sign my amendment to the loyal address already and well do to those mp whose amendment and motion have in turn support the challenge that we face together and that our constituent face daily be too important for we to fall victim to political tribalism as bristol central many first illustrate all our choice today will become part of history as green mp feel that

enormous contribution and everyone should recognise that be grateful to the people of stockport for re elect as their labour member of parliament the constituency boundary be slightly different with reddish come in and the manor ward go into the hazel grove constituency place on record my thank to all labour activist member and supporter for their commitment during the campaign and for return to the house of commons the topic want to start with be housing which continue to be the single big issue that people contact about sadly stockport council be not part of the greater manchester spatial framework because the liberal democrat councillor in stockport align with the conservatives and vote together in december against labour proposal to join the framework that mean that the borough of stockport be massively behind on housing target when stockport withdraw from the greater manchester spatial framework the borough need to build home per year in september place north west estimate that that figure have rise to almost home per year the council be on schedule to fall short of its target by home we be in housing emergency welcome the labour government commitment to build million home and decent affordable housing for everyone in my view stockport do not need any more development for investor it need housing for family and young people so that they can get on the housing ladder and have the dignity and respect of safe housing people be desperate for secure safe and affordable home far too many face homelessness or be place outside stockport far from their family support network and school be familiar with case that come through my office last week person experience homelessness be offer place to live in birmingham which be almost mile from stockport that be

implement urge the government to go far on healthcare it be fantastic that the new health secretary have meet the british dental association nhs dentistry be in crisis so many people in stockport and across greater manchester simply can not even register with an nhs dentist let alone get an appointment one of the first step that the health secretary take be to meet the british dental association which have long track record of campaigning for proper funding for nhs dentistry to ensure that people can access high quality dental care regardless of their circumstance let mention the case of someone who contact my office my paperwork state young mother be unable to find an nhs dentist when pregnant she be distressed that she can not access nhs dentistry for her now six month old daughter for when she get her first tooth as she be on the waiting list for heart surgery at alder hey hospital her daughter should be check by dentist prior to surgery due to an increase risk of infection of

the new secretary of state for his department announcement of funding for local hospital include stepping hill an example of labour in government make real difference to people life will not take up too much of the house time but wish to mention two issue quickly on railway thank the friend of reddish south station for meet on several occasion will campaign to restore proper rail service to reddish south station which have one service week that be simply not acceptable also want to see disabled access at all train station start of course in my constituency brinnington heaton chapel reddish north and reddish south station all need proper disabled access we must also invest in stockport station which be quite old and wear out it be wonderful asset offer service to london birmingham wales and across england in passenger enter and exit stockport station total of million time it be vital that our regional and national rail infrastructure be protect and invest in the station be date the lift be often faulty and it be poor experience for passenger and for the staff work there the commitment to great british railways in the labour party manifesto and from the new secretary of state for transport be welcome anyone who have travel with avanti will be familiar with the service that it offer and everyone employee as well as passenger be unhappy with it the ticket price be too expensive the service be unreliable and it be just negative experience overall avanti be hold back regional growth for greater manchester it be hold people back from make the commute for business reason or to meet family or friend labour plan for simplified and unified governance structure place passenger at the heart of the railway the new government will bring train operator under public ownership and control which welcome the final point will make be on the employment right bill we have far too many employer exploit people and pay they poverty wage we need to make sure that people get respectable wage so that they can bring up their family with pride and have the dignity of work the bill announce in the king speech will address that issue and welcome it call jim allister to make his maiden speech the other new member who have speak today have set very high bar with their maiden speech and commend they on their delivery and the very cogent construction of their speech come to this place represent the constituency of north antrim therefore my first privilege be to thank the elector of north antrim for place their confidence in and of course commend their wisdom the north antrim constituency be magnificent blend of urban and rural we have the county town of ballymena we have other main town such as ballymoney and ballycastle and we have great patchwork of village and small town include bushmills whose famous product some in this house may be familiar with other in that patchwork of village have excel in national competition britain in bloom and all of that such as broughshane ahoghill and cullybackey it be wonderful place to represent it be also place of fantastic scenery because we have the world famous north coast the crown glory of that of course be the giant causeway as well as carrick rede bridge and all those magnificent place we also have iconic inland tourist attraction such as the dark hedges so say to member of this house if you ve never be to north antrim it time to put that right what be keep you what be keep from represent north antrim in this house be year dynasty of family and party from june north antrim be represent in this house by ian paisley father and son today want to pay tribute to my predecessor for the considerable work that he do for his constituent in north antrim but it be new era it be new start and be here with very distinctive and particular message in regard to the future of northern ireland there be not much in the king speech about northern ireland apart from couple of fleeting reference it be disappointment to that there be nothing to address the disenfranchising of the people of northern ireland let explain those member who come from england scotland or wales come to this house as parliament that in tandem with devolved institution if they have they can collectively legislate for all the law that govern their constituent sadly we can not say that about my constituent or any constituent in northern ireland because in area of law sovereignty over make those law have be surrender to foreign parliament we be now subject to the last government protocol and windsor framework arrangement subject to law govern our trade our agrifood industry much of our economy and much of our environment that this house can not make and that stormont can not make those law be make in foreign parliament and then colony like be impose on northern ireland the labour movement have very proud history of opposition to colonialism but this government inherit position whereby they be preside over colonial situation of foreign jurisdiction administer law and decree and legislate law in part of this kingdom that be something that this government need to address and be not talk about trifle incidental law be talk about many law that cut to the very heart of what it mean to be united kingdom and to be part of that united kingdom refer to just one but member will find the list if they be interested in annex to the protocol that be foist upon we refer to only one which be the subjection of northern ireland to the eu custom code what that mean in practice be that when great britain send good and it be our main source of supply to our manufacturing industry in northern ireland it be send they accord to the eu custom code from foreign country because northern ireland be decree to be eu territory that be an unbearable constitutional and economic affront and that be something say to this government the secretary of state talk today about democracy and the foreign secretary will go around the world advance the cause of democracy yet in northern ireland we have situation where there be law govern so many vital aspect that we can not make and can not change that have to change and it have to be change by this house that be the fundamental message that bring from my constituent and that be why be here because my constituent will not can not should not put up with it just as the constituent of any member of this house would not put up with it it be an honour to speak on the second day of this very important debate and thank all those who have make their maiden speech today we have hear some excellent contribution from around the house particularly from my hon friend the member for ealing southall deirdre costigan there be much on which her predecessor and agree and sometimes we even disagree but one thing on which we very much agree be that the curry in bradford be far superior to that in ealing southall interruption that be perhaps contentious birmingham be third my hon friend use really key word as the theme throughout her speech which think we could all do with reflect much more on and use much more and that be diversity and the celebration of diversity so let welcome all our new hon member across the house who have join we in what be perhaps one of the most diverse parliaments look forward to work with all of they it be my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher do not know there be an island next to doncaster east but we be always learn something new who say something we should all take great note of in end his speech he say perhaps not in these word but it will be in hansard that he would stay true to the people of his constituency if could offer one word of advice to new hon member that would be it because tragically this place can consume we where it have its positive it also have its negative sometimes speak truth to power be one of the most difficult thing we can do especially remember as new member but have always believe and champion the idea that one should be free to speak we can agree to disagree but we be here to represent our constituent westminster do not send to bradford the people of bradford send here and will make sure that the people of bradford be always hear would also say as word of caution that this be not necessarily blueprint to success by say all the right thing sometimes one do not succeed in the same way but believe that we should continue to be true to ourselves in this place stick with diversity represent the beautiful city of bradford be so grateful to the people of bradford for trust and send back down to parliament as their representative bradford be diverse place and people from many different background have come together to call it their home that be what give the place its strength my own grandparent come to this country in the work long hour seven day week in the textile mill sometimes with people sleep in room that could barely accommodate three or four the journey we have make from then be remarkable may god bless the soul of my grandad may god give he the high station in paradise if he be here today and see the achievement that we have make he would be very proud all of we have to do that job here to represent our constituent and those journey equally bradford be place that have suffer in the last year the poverty and deprivation that have see on the street of bradford have be unprecedented the reality remain that the last tory government spend year cripple our economy create crisis in our nhs allow crime to rise pollute our river break our housing market let wage stagnate and persecute minority so for family in my constituency there be lot in this king speech to feel positive about as my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald who be no long in his place say with the implementation of our transformative new deal for work people to strengthen people right at work boost wage and tackle bad employer we can make work pay after year of tory pay stagnation with the establishment of great british energy to cut household energy bill and the plan to boost wealth creation in our community we can tackle the cost of living crisis that so many family continue to face with the return of rail operator to public ownership and plan to bring bus under public control we can ensure that public transport serve passenger not private company shareholder with investment in proper neighbourhood policing and name officer for every community something that have long champion we can cut crime tackle antisocial behaviour and keep our street safe and with the delivery of more healthcare in our community and improvement to our nhs we can tackle the stark health inequality that continue to blight community in bradford and in constituency up and down the country yet the king speech should have go much far fail to scrap the two child limit which affect three in five household in bradford mean that it will not tackle rampant child poverty the government yesterday launch taskforce to work on new child poverty strategy but that taskforce be guarantee to reach at least one conclusion and make at least one recommendation that child poverty be entrench by the two child limit and that that limit must be scrap urge ministers not to kick the can down the road to time when they will have to scrap the limit anyway instead they should stop the delay scrap the limit now and lift child out of poverty today and not in six month or year after the last tory government stand by as clear violation of international law be carry out re emphasise in the king speech the government commitment to human right and the rule of law be an important step however if we want the uk to regain its global leadership on these issue we can not do so without uphold our responsibility under international law that include fulfil obligation to abide by and protect the independence of the international criminal court as well as support the international court of justice and uphold numerous charter treaty convention and resolution the government must therefore immediately drop the baseless legal challenge over the icc jurisdiction and the arrest warrant seek by the chief prosecutor for benjamin netanyahu and other and they must reject all attempt to impede the icc work as the foreign secretary know recently visit the icc in the hague with my hon friend the member for leeds east richard burgon to meet human right organisation and to present to the chief prosecutor team evidence of israeli war crime gather over month of meeting with witness and expert what be clear be just how concerned those organisation be over the lack of uk involvement in such an important case again urge the government to back the icc effort to secure justice for all victim of war crime if the government do not get that right if they stray from uphold international law it put the whole international rule base order at risk and it perpetuate double standard that effectively mean one life be not always value the same as another the uk have an absolute duty to challenge those double standard to make it clear that everyone be afford the same protection and to prove that international law institution and un resolution actually mean something the government must do that in palestine but also in such place as kashmir where they must uphold un resolution that sit gather dust after more than seven decade and grant the son and daughter of kashmir their birthright of self

an incredible honour and privilege to be stand here today as the first woman mp from the county of herefordshire would like to thank the voter of north herefordshire for put their faith and trust in

early that sort of improvement make such difference in people day to day life and be key to be good constituency mp our party politic may be very different but as former shadow minister for environment food and rural affairs he proudly champion north herefordshire and its farmer indeed sir bill be famously fond of hereford cattle and feature they prominently in his literature and on his parliamentary letterhead wish he all the good as he enjoy spend more time on his farm and with his family and want to thank he for his long service in this house north herefordshire be one of the large constituency in england it be an hour drive east to west from the malvern hill to the welsh border and an hour drive north to south from shropshire nearly all the way down to ross the birthplace of british tourism be clearly go to be compete with other in invite member to visit our delightful constituency to sample their touristic delight north herefordshire be rightly fame for its bustling market town leominster and ledbury bromyard and kington for its distinctive black and white village and for its people and its produce it include two of the uk national landscape the malvern hill and the wye valley so its landscape be indeed gloriously green run along the southern boundary of the constituency be the stunning river wye about which shall have more to say shortly farming be of course central to life in north herefordshire and our county be famous for both its cattle and its apple since my predecessor make it his business to promote the cattle will take this opportunity to talk up our herefordshire apple which although hon member from somerset may wish to debate this undoubtedly produce the fine cider in the country indeed it be one of my ambition while in this house to introduce some of my county most famed beverage into the aforementioned house of commons gift shop however it be not just the landscape and the produce that make north herefordshire special it be the people one of the immense privilege of become involve in politic have be the opportunity to get to know the multitude of local institution charity community group and thrive business that make up our community the people of north herefordshire be creative innovative entrepreneurial and deeply caring it be impossible to mention all who deserve it but perhaps can give the house flavour by highlight some of they think of the creativity of the recent ledbury poetry festival the innovation exemplify by wye valley brewery approach to energy efficiency the entrepreneurialism of award win local food business such as peter cooks bread and my son favourite place to eat the beefy boys home of officially the good burger in the uk and the care exemplify by st michael hospice by echo local charity that be very close to my heart and by innumerable other local charity and community group the people of north herefordshire be what make the place so wonderful and they be why be here in my election campaign focus on three issue in particular renew our economy repair our nhs and restore our river and want to say few word about each of those topic here first renew our economy be urgent the cost of living crisis have hit many people very hard indeed fuel poverty be real issue in my constituency where the combination of relatively low wage and particularly hard to heat housing stock make home insulation an urgent priority will be press the new government hard to take the urgent action that we need to ensure that every home be an affordable home and warm home for too long the previous government neglect the opportunity offer by the green economic transformation and very much hope that this new government will not make the same mistake the king speech indicate some welcome step in the right direction but we need to do more to renew and rebuild our economy on sustainable basis one that be compatible with the challenge of climate change that so many member have say they recognise as will already be clear to the house key area of interest for be housing the green policy the right home in the right place at the right price will be the guide principle for my colleague and as we scrutinise the new government proposal on planning the country desperately need new home especially new social housing and it be vital that those home be accompany by the right infrastructure so that health education and transport service be not put under yet more strain it be also crucial to ensure that new house be build to the high possible energy efficiency standard it be so much cheap to do that now than to have to retrofit they far down the line give that we enjoy an average of eight hour of glorious sunshine each day in my constituency hope the house will forgive in advance for repeatedly make the case for every single new building in north herefordshire and indeed the country to be fit with solar panel ready to harness that sunshine it be extraordinary that we still build house without solar panel on top of they so assure colleague and my constituent that will work my sock off in the house to bring forward the policy that will deliver sustainable prosperity by renew our economy another issue that be of great concern to my constituent be the urgent need to repair our nhs and nurse it back to health along with the urgent need to invest in the local public service on which we all rely far too often on the doorstep and in the village hall of my constituency have hear story of people who have be wait far too long for the urgent treatment that they need and far too often have hear concern express about the pothole that be perhaps the most visible symptom of under investment in local government we need real change we need an end to the way in which our local nhs and herefordshire council have be starve of cash we need funding to match the level of local need we need return to multi year funding settlement for local government for both revenue and capital funding to allow council to plan long term for the infrastructure and service that be need we need more investment in preventive healthcare service we need to show our wonderful public spirited nhs staff how much we value they not just with warm word and applause but with training bursary and salary that keep pace with inflation and this parliament really must address social care for too long it have be political hot potato that no one want to touch and confess that be somewhat disappointed to see no mention of this crucial topic in the king speech believe that mechanism such as citizen assembly on social care could really help we move forward in this vital area with cross party agreement and look forward to work with colleague on this and other measure to help repair our nhs and public service finally let turn to topic that be very close to my heart and to those of my constituent the need to restore our river to good health have already extoll the virtue of the beautiful river wye which form the southern boundary of my constituency it be an integral part of the landscape and be vote the nation favourite river in but the ecological health of this much love river and its tributary include the lugg the arrow and the frome be under threat particularly due to phosphate pollution last year natural england officially downgrade its condition to unfavourable decline the lugg catchment have be subject to planning moratorium since due to excess phosphate level there be good understanding of the cause of the problem in my constituency primarily agricultural run off with the recent major expansion of the industrial poultry industry clearly play key role for too long our river have unfortunately be effectively treat as free sewer and this can not continue business can not free ride on the natural world and company must not profit from pollution local campaigner have do an excellent job of highlight the condition of the river and there be now great deal of good will among all player what we need now be supportive government who will take the action need to enforce pollution rule and invest in genuine solution because we know that restore the river and all our river across the country go hand in hand with renew our economy indeed sector such as tourism and the construction industry depend on it farmer have key role to play in this restoration and indeed in nature restoration across the whole country live on farm and be particularly inspire by the fact that so many farmer be lead the transition towards more nature friendly farming will be voice for those farmer in this house and call for the investment that farmer need to ensure that we can grow more good healthy and affordable food in the uk in way that generate and protect good job and that protect nature and the health of the soil and the water on which all life ultimately depend in closing would like to say that believe in the politic of co operation believe we can do more if we work together rather than against each other believe we can do more if we focus on our area of common ground rather than our disagreement and know that people in my constituency and across the country want to see well sort of politic that be why be passionate supporter of fair voting system in which everyone vote count equally pledge to my constituent and to all other member of this house that will work with you to find common ground look forward to work my sock off together with you to renew our economy to repair our nhs and to restore our river in do so hope that together we can create real change and rebuild trust in politic rise order we be slightly run out of time now so be go to ensure that our two remain maiden speaker get in there will obviously be no time limit on they but urge they to think of other colleague will try to get in as many people as possible but be afraid we be slightly run out of time because there have be some quite long speech call martin mccluskey to make his maiden speech thank you mr deputy speaker for the opportunity speak in this debate and to follow the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns who speak with such passion and the many other hon member who have speak this afternoon like many in this chamber be member for new constituency inverclyde and renfrewshire west stretch along the clyde coast and take in the coastal community of inverkip

idea of give people refuge by contribute to the ukrainian refugee and resettlement programme it be also people will not be surprised to hear say this beautiful part of the world know it be bit of tradition for member to say that their constituency be the most beautiful in the country and do not intend to disappoint this afternoon so inverclyde and renfrewshire west be the most beautiful constituency in the country but it be not the beauty of our surrounding that be most proud of it be the resilience the kindness and the determination of our people have the privilege of represent the

people of my constituency who look to as the good example of what service really mean in the last parliament these wonderful people and place be represent by two member ronnie cowan for inverclyde and gavin newlands for paisley and renfrewshire north which cover the village of bridge of weir and houston both of they serve their constituent with distinction want to pay particular tribute to ronnie

shipbuilding and engineering as the economic backbone of greenock and port glasgow official report june vol but today only about of those at work in my constituency be employ in manufacturing business that issue be raise by another of my predecessor iain mckenzie who lead debate on manufacturing in this place almost decade ago it be therefore disappointing that under the last government we do not see the progress that be call for the measure announce yesterday will begin the work of change that gb energy and the government plan for national wealth fund be as important for reduce our dependence on foreign energy reserve as they be for provide opportunity here at home welcome the ambition of the government plan they be put the brake on the approach that say that decline be inevitable for my constituency government work in partnership with energy company with shipyard and with advanced manufacturer include in the defence sector can bring prosperity back to the clyde be encourage to hear the secretary of state lay out how defence and the defence industry will be central to the government agenda for growth industry such as shipbuilding do not just provide people with source of employment and income they give they strong relationship dignity pride and sense that the future offer promise and opportunity rather than decline and despair as boy learn this from my grandfather who be the union treasurer at scotts shipyard in greenock work and the trade union movement provide he with route out of poverty the ability to provide for his family and the chance to ensure that his

talk about the legal case and of course there be legal case but it be the moral case that burn in the heart of so many people in our country and around the world when they see the horrific scene from gaza of the slaughter of man woman and child we have debate it so many time in this chamber that we have almost get use to it people out there want our government and hope that our government will do this to take clear moral stand by yes call for an immediate ceasefire and uphold international law but also by stop arm sale to israel to put pressure on netanyahu we do not want to see arm license in this country go to maim and kill man woman and child in gaza it be completely unconscionable and it must stop in my opinion thank my constituent for re elect with an increase majority will work night and day for you to ensure the good deal under this new government that you can get because you deserve change after nearly year of conservative misrule you deserve an increase in your living standard you deserve an end to child poverty you deserve an nhs that we can be proud of once again under the last labour government satisfaction level with our nhs be at record high while it be the welsh trade unionist and socialist aneurin bevan who be briefly expel from the labour party and come back in who create our national health service the conservatives vote against the creation of national health service over time that be one of the reason they could not be trust with the well history be important and have the conservatives learn from history there would not be just handful of they on the opposition benches after get the bad election result in their history an election result that be delighted to say they thoroughly deserve let we get on with make the change under labour government that people really need however much conservative members resent it and try to stop it join many other in congratulate member on their maiden speech they be so much well than my own but as we be short of time let move back to the topic of this debate which be defence and foreign affair while congratulate the incoming government on their success and we wish they well in the spirit of national service there be serious concern arise already from the gracious speech and the disconnect between the word of the government and their action particularly in relation to defence and foreign affair let we look first at the defence budget we be tell by the government that the world be more dangerous than it have be in live memory we be tell that there be cast iron support for increase the defence budget to of gdp but where be the action stability in term of the defence budget would be to increase it to that be the decision already communicate by the conservative government that mean billion of increase defence spending between now and where be the stability in more dangerous world in effectively reduce defence spending between now and particularly in an environment where defence procurement need long term reliability from which to plan there seem to be disconnect there the second area be veteran we be tell by the labour government that they be focus on the defence family and that the defence process should be about people quite right too but what about the veteran minister under the last government the veteran minister be cabinet member he have the ability to look right across government what be say in the debate down in plymouth moor view few week ago between the two gallant candidate do labour stand on programme that say we go to reduce the importance of the veteran minister we go to make they junior minister who will be subsume within the ministry of defence doubt that be the message that the resident of plymouth vote on but that be what the government be plan to do ask the government to think again about that finally let we look at the overseas development aid budget back in the dark day of when our economy be struggle from the fallout from covid this massive global pandemic the conservative government take the very difficult decision to reduce oda from of gni to with an ambition to reverse that as the economic condition allow at the time labour be furious and outraged by that say that even in the economic situation that exist in it be the wrong decision the then shadow minister for international development the hon member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill say britain and the world deserve well than foreign secretary who have allow the aid budget to be slash leave our global reputation lie in report november vol the now secretary of state for northern ireland say that to choose to break this promise to the world poor people be report november vol but what be labour do now the economy have improve significantly since those dark day yet labour action be to keep the figure at labour tell we that we need to increase trust in politician and that trust must be restore well the way to do that be to act in government in the way that they say they would act when in opposition intend to hold this new government to account call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you very much mr deputy speaker have sit through this important debate and it have be an absolute pleasure what galaxy of maiden speech we have hear all around we and that of course be democracy everyone can take great encouragement from what they have see today the only problem be that do not know all these new face so can issue blanket apology in advance to all those on the labour benches if come up to they and say so pleased you be new lib dem mp do not mean anything by it if say to member on the liberal democrat benches well do on get elect on labour ticket be terribly sorry about that you can take comfort mr deputy speaker in the fact that visit an old folk home recently and lovely old lady think be jeremy thorpe at least it be the right party be on my foot today because my party defence spokesperson my hon friend the member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord be ill with covid be sure we all wish he speedy recovery however do five year as my party defence spokesperson that lead to my main theme which will touch on by simply say that we will build relationship with those on the government front bench and the shadow front bench that be how we work will always remember ben wallace arrange for and the present secretary of state to be helicoptere to belvoir castle for meeting of the joint expeditionary force foreign ministers have never forget that because it be just two day before putin tank roll across the border remember go in the car from the mod to board our military helicopter and the civil servant ask and the present secretary of state what do you think will happen think we both say he probably invade also remember ben wallace say during the dinner with the foreign secretaries be do this because government change and it as well you be prepared although you may belong to other party and that you know as much as you can about the defence brief want to go on the record as thank ben wallace for his very generous attitude to keep brief on intelligence and thank the present secretary of state for his generous offer to see that my colleague my party defence spokesperson be similarly brief that be very good news indeed want to congratulate through reason of friendship those on the government front bench on their appointment it be very good to see they in their place and indeed be bind to say it be good to see those on the opposition front bench in their place the shadow foreign secretary be quite correct to remind we of what be go on in sudan it be not just about russia and ukraine or the middle east there be all sort of terrible thing happen in the world like too the secretary of state say that britain be democracy most reliable ally we ought to remember that on day like today when all these new face exemplify democracy in its good healthy working form do not have much time but want to touch on two point one of which think those on both front benches know care passionately about serve for short spell of time as private soldier in the territorial army and one of my child serve in the force until recently the size of our force matter an enormous amount to my party and think we all understand that we be very far stretch at the moment hence my intervention early in the debate about the present size of the british army be not exactly helpful to recruitment one other thing that think be desperately important base on when we meet with the joint expeditionary force foreign ministers be that as all hon member have say we must work across border we must work with the european community and we must work with friend only by co operation by stand together can we take on the russian bear and see it off as have quite correctly be say if ukraine fall what be next finally in defence debate during my year in this place have always think the atmosphere of consensus across party boundary very important know from my own family that it be encouraging to our servicewoman and servicemen to know that politician be speak as one from what have hear this afternoon have no reason to worry that that will not go on in future think that we can work together for the defence of our nation which we love so well call the opposition spokesperson it be pleasure to follow the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone although must say that have never confuse he with jeremy thorpe and to see you in the chair mr deputy speaker as respond to the gracious speech debate thank all right hon and hon member who have make speech today but pay particular tribute to all those who make maiden speech the time limit mean that can not go through those contribution in as much detail as would like but will briefly congratulate all those hon member the hon member for ealing southall deirdre costigan speak passionately about diversity and add to it with her strong irish heritage the hon member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher be surely the first ever mp to have work as sewer baiter my twin have their birthday during the election campaign so know how the hon member for kensington and bayswater joe powell feel it be painful but it get well do not worry wish he and his family well the hon member for bristol central carla denyer make point of order early about energy infrastructure pylon have also be propose in suffolk and agree with she that there be other option we be say to the government that we want to see they be grateful for her very passionate maiden speech the hon member for north antrim jim allister will be sure it be fair to say be doughty champion for his constituent it be brilliant to have in the hon member for tewkesbury cameron thomas former member of the royal air force in parliament especially in the current context be passionate about the global combat air programme when be minister for defence procurement it show the importance of our maintain combat air competitiveness hope that he will contribute to the debate next wednesday be grateful to hear the cut and thrust of scottish colleague include the hon member for midlothian kirsty mcneill and for inverclyde and renfrewshire west martin mccluskey and of course my hon friend the member for dumfries and galloway john cooper who certainly punch above his weight in his maiden speech arguably we do not hear enough about rural matter in the king speech but the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns certainly make up for that she will clearly be passionate advocate for farming and the environment in her constituency be grateful for all those maiden speech and hope that we will hear much more from those colleague in future turn to defence matter may welcome the new foreign affair and defence ministerial team to their position as the shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell say we will work with they where it be in the national interest especially on support ukraine for as long as it take as they do when they be in opposition we welcome the cross party spirit in which the secretary of state for defence set out his plan for strategic defence review we look forward to work with lord robertson for whom have the great respect in constructive and collaborative manner may thank the secretary of state for pay tribute to the two previous secretaries of state ben wallace and grant shapps both of whom have the privilege to work with as minister for defence procurement they can both be rightly proud of the enormous contribution that they make in support ukraine but they have something else in common they be not afraid to make the unambiguous case for high defence spending and most importantly they be successful it help that they have prime minister who as chancellor oversee the large spending review increase for defence since the cold war and ensure that we go into the general election with credible and fully fund plan to increase our defence budget to of gdp by although welcome the fact that the labour government have say that they be committed to we have nothing but uncertainty over their timetable indeed this morning be interview by kay burley of sky news she put it to that the government timetable be to reach by the end of the parliament so or say that that be not what understand the public position to be but she tell that she have be inform privately by the government that that be the timetable so would be grateful if they confirm now in parliament what exactly the position be on this matter of great sensitivity let explain why the timetable for really matter when the previous prime minister announce that we would commit to he state that his top priority be to replenish our munition that figure enable we to commit billion of extra funding over year to fund munition and it be fact know this that without clear pathway to the ministry of defence would have have to make substantial cut or deferment to programme in order to afford that necessary replenishment of our munition that be why it be so significant and why we need to know exactly what the position be be kay burley correct that the government have tell sky news that they have timetable for reach by or if not if there be no timetable for be the mod go to fund its munition strategy will those order for shell and missile for the army navy and air force actually be place this year if not what will be the impact on our world lead defence sector and above all what will be the impact on our warfighting capability as nation without clear pathway to what will be the immediate impact on the department finance will the mod continue to invest in cut edge capability such as direct energy weapon and hypersonic that would also have stabilise our two big defence programme in light of the inflationary funding pressure that follow putin invasion of ukraine this be all open and in the public domain the public accounts committee be talk about it in the lead up to the general election be talk about the nuclear deterrent and the global combat air programme our absolutely essential sixth generation fighter programme be delighted that we now have consensus between the government and ourselves on both the nuclear deterrent and gcap but can the government confirm that delay will have no impact on the fund element of either of those two major programme can the secretary of state or the minister respond also confirm that the secretary of state strategic defence review will conclude entirely before the next spending review commence so that that review be threat base rather than force on to the financial back foot by treasury consideration of course if the government public position be that there be no timetable to they will inevitably point to the old chestnut of the public finance be bad than fear justify the inevitable cut or deferment of programme that follow have the great respect for the secretary of state but we do hear some of that in his opening remark be afraid that that excuse will not wash though inflation be at and on target the economy be grow at healthy rate and ahead of our competitor wage be rise unemployment be almost half what it be in when we take power and the deficit be forecast to fall to just over of gdp by the end of the current forecast period interruption labour members chunter they talk about mission when we come to power our mission be to save this country from bankruptcy because once again the socialist have run out of other people money the forecast deficit in be head well north of so we do the right thing we have to take difficult decision and we restore our public finance because of that when the pandemic strike and the energy support have to be put in place we could afford that enormous support we be proud of that proud of furlough of save those job and those business in every constituency we do it because of those difficult decision after the mess labour leave we in interruption labour member talk about the previous prime minister but one but our strong economic legacy can not be use to pray in aid cover for cut and deferment interruption they quibble when we talk about strong economic legacy how else can we describe low unemployment inflation at low and fall deficit half what it be when we take over from they or the high growth in the that be fantastic inheritance far from be an excuse for the cut that the government will have to come to those be the feature of the very improvement in economic condition that make our pre election commitment to financially credible and deliverable we strongly welcome the prime minister staunch support for nato as evidence in washington and we want he to succeed on his pledge to strengthen britain defence that be in our national interest but it be action that matter and by which the government will be judge and defer and delay offer nothing but uncertainty to our armed force at the bad possible time if the government have private timetable to reach they need to share it if there be not one urge the secretary of state to persuade the prime minister and his treasury colleague to think again because in this more dangerous world high defence spending be matter of the utmost urgency for britain it be an honour to close such well informed and at time passionate debate and will endeavour to respond to as many point as can get through in the time available as my right hon friend the defence secretary say at the beginning of this debate the foreign secretary be extremely disappointed that he be not able to participate today and know that he will want to update the house shortly on his recent international engagement it be an enormous privilege for to speak in this chamber for the first time as the minister of state for development as the minister for women and equalities and as part of new government who be proud to serve our country and be work to reconnect britain with the world welcome the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge to his new place on the opposition front bench and of course the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell to whom be personally very grateful for reach out to on my appointment note that both the previous incumbent in my role and the defence secretary say at the very beginning of the debate that this be time when we need to respect other point of view think that have largely hold although perhaps we have slight change of approach in the speech by the hon member for south suffolk overall think we hear throughout this debate definite determination to focus on bring people together when we can as part of national mission of renewal we hear so many excellent maiden speech today really terrific introduction to the house from many new colleague but it be particularly pertinent that my new hon friend the member for midlothian kirsty mcneill make reference to the need to recognise that so often we have more in common than divide we we need to bear that approach in mind locally nationally and globally in these often dangerous time it be clear that the british people have give this new government mandate for change in order to deliver our progressive vision for share future vision root in cool head realism about the world as it be and guide by hope for what it can be as say we be already work to reconnect britain to the world after year during which there have at time be disengagement and isolationism in so do we be turbocharge our mission for growth to bring investment and job to every part of our country in these often dangerous and divide time the uk security be our first priority as my right hon friend the defence secretary

climate crisis and we will champion human right and international law we will work in partnership with our friend and ally to reduce global poverty and the driver of conflict and instability and we will also empower woman and girl in that connection congratulate my new hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher on his heartwarming maiden speech and particularly his reference to the woman in his life indeed many new member have make reference to their partner and family in their maiden speech as the minister for development and for women and equalities know that deliver truly effective and modern approach to development have never be so urgent or so important on that concur with the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david

always be fundamental for my party so many powerful champion from this house be household name barbara castle clare short gordon brown and of course my predecessor who hold this brief in opposition my right hon friend the member for wigan lisa nandy to whom pay tribute the shadow foreign secretary have often be critical of damage do under conservative government to development and our country reputation he refer to the fact that previous conservative governments have literally remove food from the plate of starve child official report july vol he also say that previous conservative governments have trash our international reputation appreciate his honesty but now be the time for reflection on fact that he do not mention today the damage do by the uncontrolled growth in the previous government spending from the development budget on accommodation that spending be classify as overseas development aid but it lead to cut in programme for some of the needy people in the world in spirit of openness we must surely acknowledge today that that have do tremendous damage to our reputation we be waste no time in seek to restore our development reputation by increase support for those most affect by hurricane beryl and by ensure that the foreign secretary visit our close ally have listen carefully to the minister as she know not least from what say today have be critical of early decision but can she tell the house today whether she have yet think through when we might see the return that be absolutely something that this government take incredibly seriously under previous labour governments the commitment help to build our reputation across the world we have be clear that we be determined to get back to as fiscal circumstance allow but we will also be clear about situation in which the percentage of our gross national income that can go to development have be compromise because of uncontrolled cost such as those incur under the previous government surely

membership that commitment from the uk to ensure that ukraine can proceed to nato be unshakeable as have be mention we will also set out clear and credible path to spend of uk gdp on defence as we call on other to step up would gently point out to the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew that there be no credible plan from the previous government will the minister give way no

issue and so many other as this debate have indicate there be deep concern in our country and globally about the death and destruction in gaza the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran refer to it as she have often do so powerfully she have both professional understanding of the issue and sadly personal experience of it before the foreign

the scotland act motion make and question propose that this house do now wakeford thank you for call mr deputy speaker will hesitate for just second as the chamber clear my normal popularity three year ago on march present to the house the implication of the unlawful scottish government investigation and contrive criminal charge against alex salmond recommend empower the scottish parliament to investigate as scottish court find that the government act illegally and engage in process taint by bias against mr salmond regrettably the investigative committee appoint by holyrood be limit in its power of investigation operate without the protection of privilege and be thwart at every turn by the delay obfuscation and even threat from the scottish government and institution of state three year on that failure in democratic accountability have not be address the investigatory power of the scottish parliament could have be strengthen decision about whether and who to prosecute could have be make entirely independently of ministers in the scottish government neither of those thing have happen force to raise the matter again mr salmond have be find innocent he previously succeed in scotland high civil court in establish the illegality of scottish government action he be currently sue the scottish government in civil action that have be assist as some of those involve in construct the case against mr salmond be now themselves under police investigation will therefore focus today on the wide failing in this sorry case and what they raise for the state of the rule of law in scotland in senior scottish government figure set up procedure for deal with sexual harassment allegation that effectively target alex salmond believe that at an early stage that be do with the knowledge of nicola sturgeon team and potentially with their encouragement the procedure apply retrospectively to former ministers mr salmond no long be minister but exclude civil servant sue gray then head of propriety and ethic at the cabinet office express discomfort with the procedure despite that the scottish government proceed an investigate officer be appoint they be to have have no prior contact with complainant yet the officer appoint judith mackinnon have in fact have extensive prior contact with the complainant it have now also emerge the person decide the case former permanent secretary leslie evans also meet with complainant during the process that information be withhold from the court of session in one of the many breach of the scottish governmental duty of candour in this case mr salmond be inform of the complaint against he in march all be deny and in april his legal team immediately raise concern about the fairness and legality of the new procedure as well as concern over mr salmond access to witness and document he offer mediation and arbitration to bring the illegality of the process into focus it be repeatedly reject message between two civil servant in early february show how liz lloyd sturgeon chief of staff be directly interfere in discussion with complainer ahead of their complaint be make her role acting we must assume with the knowledge of her boss be central to these event furthermore evidence to the holyrood inquiry from mr salmond former chief of staff geoff aberdein state that liz lloyd in early march inform he that there be two individual complainer three other witness support that assertion that directly contradict her claim that she first become aware of the allegation in april yet it be claim she doubtless feel compel to make in order not to contradict nicola sturgeon position already give to the scottish parliament sturgeon mislead the scottish parliament would of course have lead to her resignation the same untruth be repeat on behalf of the scottish government during the judicial review it be the position of mr salmond legal team that neither lloyd nor sturgeon be tell the truth very quickly after my previous debate on these matter the scottish police visit ask where have get all this information they get nice cup of tea and biscuit strangely they have no interest whatsoever in what appear to be prima facie evidence of perjury by those hold high office let say clearly today that these matter obviously require to be properly investigate by the police in august ignore the evident impropriety of the process the permanent secretary leslie evans decide that some complaint against salmond be well found salmond be tell of evans decision and that press release be to be issue at pm salmond legal team be about to lodge judicial review of the whole procedure so it urgently seek and receive write assurance that no press release would be issue despite those assurance only hour later the daily record publish news of the allegation part of the decision report have be unlawfully leak other than mr salmond only the scottish government have that report however have meet witness who have make statement that he be tell by the then political editor of the daily record that the story be leak by liz lloyd the house should know that the prosecutor from the information commissioner office investigate the leak conclude have sympathy with the hypothesis that the leak come from an employee of the scottish government the scottish government fight the judicial review at huge cost despite their own legal adviser tell they in no uncertain term that they would fail they be warn it make little sense to continue to defend the indefensible and that the least bad option be to concede the case eventually both the scottish government external counsel tell the government that they be in an untenable position and be suffer extreme professional embarrassment because of government failing they be also warn this be important that civil servant be deliberately mislead both they and the court despite these repeat warning the government only concede the judicial review after their external counsel threaten resignation in january the court of session find that the scottish government have act unlawfully and that their action and process be procedurally unfair and taint by apparent bias commentator often describe the investigation as botched it be that and more it be illegal pure and simple yet no one have be hold accountable and million of pound of taxpayer money be waste that be perhaps unsurprising when look at the attitude of those at the top of the scottish civil service the same day that salmond win his case the permanent secretary leslie evans send message to colleague say that the battle be lose but not the war that be hardly the language of an impartial civil servant senior figure at the top of the scottish government appear to have collude to ensure that salmond be report to police scotland there be evidence of contact between figure in the scottish government and officer of the scottish national party whatsapp message reveal that liz lloyd be convene council of war whatsapp group whistleblower reveal communication from sue ruddick the snp chief operating officer that in their word point to to collusion perjury up to criminal conspiracy in the communication she and the then chief executive of the snp peter murrell encourage and coach complainant into report salmond to the police appear at the holyrood inquiry in december murrell be ask whether he be part of the so call council of war whatsapp group murrell deny even use whatsapp yet it emerge that he do have whatsapp and have use it within week of the evidence session yet another clear lie the house may wonder what the scottish government investigation have to do with the scottish national party in the first place the answer be provide by anne harvey qualified lawyer who be then senior official for the snp in this house who wisely refuse to have anything to do with what she characterise as witch hunt recommend colleague read again my debate on march in that debate outline the action of senior officer of the snp peter murrell and sue ruddick and their compliance officer ian mccann whose interference in an ongoing police inquiry represent nothing less than an attempt to pervert the course of justice the police scotland investigation be trigger by leslie evans who send the result of this internal inquiry to the crown agent mr david harvie the crown agent be responsible for oversee all prosecution in scotland despite the subsequent police inquiry and court case salmond be acquit on all charge by majority female jury in front of female judge as result of the scottish government unlawful handling of the allegation the scottish parliament establish committee to examine how the first minister scottish government official and special adviser deal with complaint against salmond even before the committee report be publish the convener say the committee be be undermine by delay prevarication and obfuscation on the part of the snp government when publish the report be damn it read many document be in our view insufficient to provide complete picture of the event be consider by the committee and again that have hamper the committee work there would be uproar if committee of this house be impede in such manner but the scottish government attempt to thwart the parliamentary inquiry do not stop there it ignore two vote in the scottish parliament and wait until the very last minute to release legal advice it have receive on the judicial review that advice be only release the day before sturgeon would give evidence after the opposition threaten no confidence motion against the current first minister john swinney even then when release it be not the full advice crucial part be only make available after sturgeon have appear additionally the crown office be threaten msp with prosecution due to the proceeding of the committee such threat would be treat in westminster as contempt of parliament at the instigation of the crown office police scotland open an investigation after whatsapp message give to the inquiry be make public the message show peter murrell call for pressure to be put on the police to investigate salmond throughout this sorry business the crown office have be enthusiastic in its pursuit of those who have publish evidence in this case journalist have be jail another journalist be prosecute in case completely dismiss by the sheriff court the crown office engage in legal battle with the spectator to stop the publication of evidence to the parliamentary committee what be most troubling be that at the time the line manager of david harvie the crown agent who oversee prosecution in scotland be leslie evans the scottish government permanent secretary and mr harvie legal boss be the former lord advocate james wolffe who himself be advise the scottish government not to concede the judicial review against that same scottish government that set up be fundamentally wrong will outline just one example of why on march mr harvie the crown agent be at pain to tell the parliamentary committee under oath that he have never discuss the case with his line manager leslie evans now that may be true however what can now tell the house be that document show mr harvie have in fact discuss the matter with leslie evan private secretary her representative on earth if you like in the day before he become involved in the case it be fundamentally unsatisfactory that the then crown agent the senior official in the administration of justice in scotland can not be rely upon to tell parliamentary committee the whole truth find it even more unsatisfactory when the crown office show no interest in investigate these grave matter in give evidence to the inquiry nicola sturgeon repeatedly fail to answer question because she could not recall in the end the committee find by vote of five to four that nicola sturgeon have give an inaccurate account of her knowledge of the allegation in one of its clear finding the parliamentary committee find unanimously that leslie evans be personally as well as corporately responsible for failing that cost the scottish taxpayer million of pound and lead to the humiliation of the scottish government in the high civil court in scotland due to their unlawful behaviour have there be any penalty for those failing of course not instead ms evans contract be extend along with her pension the damage she have cause both by her action and inaction have be leave totally unaccounted for something must be do to prevent these failure of accountability in public service in future and hope that the duty of candour legislation in the king speech mean that something finally will be do alongside the holyrood inquiry the lawyer james hamilton be ask to consider whether nicola sturgeon have breach the ministerial code during this affair while mr hamilton conclude that sturgeon do not breach the code his report be so heavily redact by the scottish government that he in highly unusual move insist on the publication of rather stark note along with it hamilton say that such redaction present an incomplete and even at time mislead version of what happen have hear evidence that special adviser not lawyer appoint by nicola sturgeon have be directly involve in the redaction of mr hamilton report have pursue this point with the current permanent secretary but have not receive satisfactory or clear reply to obtain further information on the hamilton report freedom of information request be make to the scottish government the scottish government refuse to publish the request information claim that they do not hold it despite its be their report the information commissioner rubbish their claim and order that it be publish the scottish government attempt to appeal against that decision attend the appeal last year in edinburgh and note that the government case be not just summarily dismiss but dismiss in completely humiliating manner have bring number of case against government and have never see quite such an outright humiliating dismissal despite these loss the scottish government have still fail to publish the information request and now oppose the publication on other ground when first bring these matter to the attention of the house nicola sturgeon be still first minister in all her unchallengeable pomp she be not any more we all know what have happen to she and the top management of the snp since can not and will not go into all that now but that be the important backdrop to this sorry saga my purpose today have be to concentrate on matter of fundamental principle so we can ensure that such unlawful and shameful event can not be repeat these event have occur under the devolution settlement secure under the scotland act the holyrood parliamentary committee suffer because it do not have adequate power to hold the scottish government to account which allow it to be frustrate by the government and threaten by the crown office it be simply not appropriate for the lord advocate to be both the public prosecutor and the government legal adviser put forward that position three year ago in my adjournment debate of march and be support by the former member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry ms cherry present private member bill that have cross party support however despite the case be concede in principle by the scottish government no legislative action have follow there be also concern about how the snp leadership exert influence over the rule of law in scotland in the scottish parliament the crown office and procurator fiscal service the court the police and the medium nicola sturgeon be no long first minister but her successor have continue to suppress the truth about their party disgraceful attempt to destroy alex salmond and in so do they have continue to deny he proper redress however this be about more than alex salmond to ensure that it never happen again we must review the consequence for civil servant find to have act improperly by parliamentary committee we must strengthen the investigative power and legal protection offer to member of the scottish parliament and we must immediately separate the power of scottish law officer from their role in administer criminal justice and provide advice to the scottish government it be time to invoke famous phrase often invoke in england but just as pertinent in scotland fiat justitia let justice be do before sit down may in what be otherwise an incredibly serious debate apologise to the minister for the fact that my action today force she to make her maiden speech at such short notice if may say so she carry that off brilliantly and deserve double point for it thank the right hon member for warmly welcome to the chamber and indeed for the work that we have do together in the past on promote the value of humanitarianism he will know not only that this be my first day speak at the dispatch box but that my maiden speech just short while ago be my very first contribution of any kind in this house hope that with nearly four decade of dedicated service in this place he may still recall the trepidation of standing here to speak for the first time turn to the subject matter of the debate begin with celebration of the scotland act it be year since her late majesty queen elizabeth ii open the scottish parliament and the late and much miss donald dewar be swear in as first minister donald dewar the father of devolution describe the scottish parliament as not an end but mean to great great social justice in scotland that be the drive imperative that still guide labour which be why ensure support for both the union and the devolved institution should be see as precondition for and not the sum total of this government ambition in the quarter century since the establishment of the scottish parliament we have see deepening of devolution through the and scotland act crucially those reform be base on cross party consensus in scotland be immensely proud that will now have role in the ongoing success of those act as they continue to deliver for people in scotland it be right that we continue to hear view from all side on how constitutional framework should evolve however believe that it be through relationship and collaboration that we will drive progress together and deliver for the people we be send here to serve as my right hon friend the secretary of state for scotland have make clear we all need to work on reset relationship indeed the prime minister have already make this priority with his first official engagement be with the first minister in scotland that have be mirror by early engagement by ministers throughout the uk government and assure the house that it will continue for my part be clear that improve and ongoing co operation will depend on three main thing the first be the sincerity of our collective commitment to deep and durable resetting of relationship like the act itself collaborative working must endure beyond specific administration and ministers and be about more than formal structure and machinery that do not always mean that we will agree but we must be more mature about those disagreement and depolarise and detoxify the tone of debate in scotland that should be the nature of grow up politic and it be what the people of scotland and of all four nation of the uk rightly expect from we as their elect representative secondly we need dynamic understanding of devolution as an ongoing process of redistribute power which be already evidence in our commitment to metro mayor in england and to further devolution within england as set out in the king speech and in the establishment of the council of the nations and regions thirdly we must commit to genuine era of people power with community co operative civil society and local government work with the government at all level to deliver the change scotland need as hope my maiden speech make clear we all need to have an open hearted approach to work together in the good interest of the people we serve turn now to the substance of today debate appreciate the deeply hold concern of the right hon member the government be focus on rebuild trust in politic across the whole of the uk in our manifesto we have be clear that it be not only here in westminster where more must be do to uphold the standard we expect to see in public life scrutiny of the scottish government be matter for the scottish parliament and it could be raise there by the right hon member colleague nevertheless we have commit in our manifesto to ensure that member of devolved legislature will have the same free speech protection enjoy by mps here at westminster to well ensure that elect representative can hold those in power to account hope that the right hon member will welcome that commitment it be important to emphasise that legal proceeding between mr salmond and the scottish government be ongoing appreciate that there will be many view on how the scotland act might be improve that be only right and be sure that we will continue to hear those view both here and in the scottish parliament but as have say the settlement have be remade over the course of year on the basis of broad consensus delivery must now be our focus as the king speech set out yesterday this government be commit to deliver change for scotland from make scotland the home of great british energy which be central to our mission to make the uk clean energy superpower to the new national wealth fund and the new deal for work people we will deliver well outcome for people in scotland particularly those at the sharp end of inequality which hold back too many people while it be true that co operation between government at political level have not always be straightforward nevertheless the scotland act have endure have often say that while scot do not have to agree about everything we do have to find way to agree about more labour be the party of devolution and we will be government of collaboration but above all we be go to deliver for the people of scotland there be so much to do it be time to get start question put and agree to house adjourn
