foulden who have be tell that they will need to wait over three year to have their cataract see to in scotland meanwhile their neighbour who be register with gp in england be be treat by nhs england

government spending in scotland to deliver public service the united kingdom government be provide record settlement of billion per year the large since devolution in fact the uk government be provide the scottish government with over more funding per person than the equivalent uk government spending in england with the generous fiscal framework agreement the scottish government have the certainty and flexibility to manage their budget and deliver high quality public service across scotland the recent programme for government launch by the scottish first minister only reveal tired government too distract by internal squabbling to achieve anything for the people of scotland do the minister agree that the scottish people deserve change of government in scotland and westminster with labour government focus on tackle the cost of live and improve living standard for the whole of the uk the snp programme for government be complete and utter miss opportunity rather than focus on scotland

minister my hon friend the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie be due to meet my hon friend shortly fisherman from portavogie ardglass and kilkeel work hand in hand with

and northern ireland can work well together include here at westminster be happy to work with all colleague across the united kingdom to advance the fishing industry and be happy to meet the hon member to discuss how we do that together devolution of drugs policy what discussion he have hold with cabinet colleague and the scottish government on the devolution of drug policy to scotland what discussion he have hold with cabinet colleague and the scottish government on the devolution of drug policy to scotland illicit drug destroy life and devastate community the united kingdom government year drug strategy set out ambitious plan back by record billion over three year to tackle the supply of illicit drug and build world class system of treatment and recovery this be uk wide strategy and there be no plan to devolve drug policy to the scottish government the lord advocate have announce that she be not go to prosecute drug user for simple possession offence commit within pilot safe drug consumption facility both the home affairs committee of this house and the scottish affairs committee have recommend that the uk government support such pilot in glasgow by create legislative pathway under the misuse of drugs act that would enable such facility to operate or by devolve the power to the scottish government both cross party committees of this house be very clear that the evidence show that those measure could be lifesave so when will the secretary of state act to save life in scotland by persuade his government to drop their intransigence on this issue it be disappointing that the scottish government be not prepared to work with the uk government on project adder that offer be make with support funding the in adder be for enforcement believe the police and the procurator fiscal service should be enforce the law in scotland not decriminalise drug because enforcement help to drive people to health solution the minister do not answer the question so will try again scotland need caring compassionate human right inform drug policy with public health and the reduction of harm as its principle and the scottish government be ready and willing to work with the uk government to put that progressive policy into practice scottish tory msp miles briggs say on good morning scotland yesterday that he hop the uk government would not move to block this lifesave measure despite the minister cabinet colleague continue to denounce its effectiveness what recent discussion have he have with the scottish government on advance this pilot scheme drug consumption room be not the easy solution hon member may think they be there be no safe way to take illegal drug drug devastate life ruin family and damage community the uk government believe that the police and the procurator fiscal service should fully enforce the law however say to the hon lady that if the scottish government and the lord advocate decide to proceed with pilot on dcrs the uk government will not intervene the secretary of state will fully realise the challenge it would present for border force if we have differ rule on what drug be lawful and not lawful across the united kingdom therefore will he assure that he will not look to devolve drug policy and will instead get the scottish government to focus on their own responsibility hear hear labour members always seem to cheer at this moment in scottish question they be very generous my hon friend make very good point drug death in scotland be three time high than the uk average despite the law be the same across the uk do not believe drug consumption room be the panacea to those problem but we absolutely must have drug law that work across the whole united kingdom because it be uk wide problem call the snp spokesperson think we should be clear the lord advocate statement on monday be game changer it remove one of the major obstacle to pilot drug consumption facility which be design to prevent overdose the secretary of state have be equivocal in his response so far so let give he another chance to get on the right side of history will he actually say that he will support and work with the scottish government to see this pilot project through think have be clear have be clear that the uk government policy be not to proceed with drug consumption room we believe as have say that drug devastate family and destroy community be very clear about those thing but be also very clear that the lord advocate and the scottish government appear to have achieve workaround that allow they to have pilot drug consumption room probably in glasgow and the united kingdom government will not intervene in that so the snp now have no more excuse can press the secretary of state on this point because of course he have form on intervene in decision of the scottish government he say he will not intervene can we therefore be clear that he will say on behalf of the uk government that he will not use any administrative or legislative mean to frustrate or block this pilot policy by the scottish government hear hear be very popular today will be with snp members in particular when say that the answer be yes cost of live increase what recent discussion he have hold with the scottish government on the impact of increase in the cost of live on people in the uk and scotland our government have take assertive action on the cost of living uk wide support for household to help with high energy bill be worth billion or per household on average the united kingdom government focus have be on support everyone with the cost of live with specific target support and tailor intervention for the most vulnerable thank the minister for his answer he will know that like his constituent my constituent in edinburgh west still face the impact of food inflation high energy bill and unfair standing charge for electricity however we also now face the potential bombshell of council tax hike by the scottish government which will affect household in edinburgh west that will have to pay more than year will the uk government be speak to the scottish if snp members do not mind will the uk government be speak to the scottish government to try to mitigate this and what step do they have in mind to do so share the hon lady concern about the snp green government bombshell tax plan to hike up the tax burden for many household with people already face pressure on their household budget as she will know along with the record block grant the spring budget provide the scottish government with an extra million over the next two year on top of the billion of additional funding that we provide in the autumn statement of our economic priority of halve inflation and grow the economy be the most effective way of support her constituent strength of the union what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the union believe that support for the union be strong the united kingdom be one of the most successful political and economic union in the world and the foundation on which all our business and citizen be able to thrive when we work collaboratively we be safe strong and more prosperous while the snp first minister whip up grievance politic at independence rally scotland nhs go backwards scotland ferry do not work and scotland economy stagnate do the secretary of state agree that it be about time that the snp stop obsess about another independence referendum and start deliver for the people of scotland agree with my hon friend and could not have put it well myself be the truth of the union not that while we see independent norway and independent ireland in budget surplus independent ireland with surplus this year of billion rise to billion in the next three year the scottish government can not build small hospital on small scottish island be the answer not for scotland to remove the westminster handcuff and to get the independence and budget surplus of norway and ireland so that we can move forward and move away from the brexit of the tories and the labour party they always say independence will sort the problem scotland be not build hospital on the island because the scottish government be squander the most generous settlement they have have since devolution begin before we come to prime minister question wish to welcome special guest who be

household in the uk have the low living standard since the while hard work family be struggle to make end meet the wealthy be play by different set of rule with report that even member of the house of lords be try to exploit the non dom status loophole to avoid pay their fair share do the prime minister agree that whether it be the wife of the most powerful man in the country or the host of the apprentice no billionaire should qualify for special tax treatment while my constituent face soar level of inequality and poverty the fact tell very different story from what the hon gentleman say he mention inequality inequality today be low than it be in he mention the number of people in poverty again be pleased to say that million few people be in poverty today than in include many in scotland

conservative government we have the opportunity to be the first country in the world to end new case of hiv by that be partially down to our world lead opt out hiv testing programme that have be roll

police who track down the escaped terror suspect from wandsworth prison last week despite be charge with terrorism and despite be flight risk he be not hold in category prison why not thank the police and their partner for their effort to find and arrest daniel khalife there be now an ongoing legal process that must be allow to take its course but would like to reassure the public that while these case be extremely rare the justice secretary have launch an internal investigation about how this could happen as well as an independent investigation of the incident so that we can learn the lesson from this case and ensure that it never happen again the truth be the government be preside over mayhem in the criminal justice system only few short month ago zara aleena family say that ministers have these be their on their hand after probation failure that lead to her murder so it beggar belief that we be back here once again the chief inspector of prison say that condition in wandsworth be so bad that it should be shut down the chancellor be tell anyone who will listen that he raise concern month ago probation school building and now prison why do the prime minister keep ignore the warning until it be too late the right hon and learn gentleman with his background should know well because of the wide variety and considerable difference in severity of people charge under that act

be also improve retention at the same time we be invest million to improve prison security with new measure such as ray body scanner if he want to have truly honest debate about this perhaps he would

start the session by leave please do so be happy to help you on your way every week whatever the topic the prime minister paint this picture as if everything be great and fine out there it be so at odd with the live experience in the real world let turn to another serious security concern some in this house face sanction intimidation and threat from the chinese state when ask the prime minister on monday whether the foreign secretary raise the specific issue of the allege spy arrest in march when he visit china few week ago he would only say that he raise that type of activity but avoid specific ask the prime minister again do the foreign secretary raise this specific case when he visit china yes or no refer the right hon and learn gentleman to my previous answer where say clearly that the foreign secretary raise these issue with the chinese foreign minister whom he meet as do when have my meeting with premier li over the weekend when it come to china the government have put in place the most robust policy that have ever exist in our country foreign policy it be to protect our country and the value and interest we stand up for it be to align our approach with our close ally include those in the and five eye and it be to engage where it make sense either to advance our interest or as do at the weekend to raise our very significant concern that be the right approach to china it be one that be welcome by each and every one of our ally would be interested to know what he think he would do differently that certainly be not yes what the prime minister say now be totally at odd with the intelligence and security committee of parliament report of july that set out that the government have no clear strategy when it come to china have fail to support the intelligence agency and be leave the uk severely handicapped in manage our future security this have be raise time and again but yet again the prime minister fail to heed the warning and be now desperately play catch up will he finally commit to the full audit of uk china relation that so many in this house have so long demand as always the leader of the opposition be just play catch up but he have not catch up with the reality of what be actually happen he talk about the isc report if he actually go through it he would realise that it relate to period of investigation in and since then we have launch whole new integrate review refresh of our china strategy which be publish we have put in place range of new measure include the national security protective authority which be staff out of and support business and organisation to be alert to the risk from cyber and from china if the right hon and learn gentleman want to talk about foreign policy he should perhaps reflect on his own record this be the man who say he be behind the former labour leader person who want to abolish the army scrap trident and withdraw from nato it be clear what he do he put his own political interest ahead of britain probation prison school china yet again inaction man fail to heed the warning and then blame everyone else for the consequence on sunday the home secretary celebrate her first anniversary in post that is if we overlook the six day she miss when she be deem national security risk in that year people have cross the channel on small boat and the taxpayer be now spend million day on hotel bill the prime minister be fail to stop terrorist stroll out of prison fail to guard britain against hostile actor and he be completely fail to stop the boat how can anyone trust he to protect the country the right hon and learn gentleman talk about trust and about action but just today this government be take action to reform defective eu law to unlock over home boost our economy support job and ensure that we can realise the aspiration of homeowner he talk about trust he try in this house to talk the talk on house building but at the first sign of cheap political hit what do he do he cave in rather than make the right long term decision for the country he have take the easy way out it be typical of the principle free conviction free type of leadership that he offer flip flopping from be builder to blocker the british public can not trust word he say every week the prime minister come here protest that nothing be his fault and try to convince anyone who be still listen that everything be great the truth be that the floor fall in for million of family because of the government economic mayhem the classroom ceiling collapse because he cut vital school budget and now the wall of our national security have be breach because they have ignore repeat warning no one vote for this shamble no one vote for he how much more damage do the british public have to put up with before he finally find the stomach to give they say we be get on for the british public just in the last week we have announce new landmark deal for british scientist and attract million of new investment for our world lead auto industry and wage be now rise at the fast rate on record and where have the right hon and learn gentleman be this week lock away with labour union paymaster promise to give they more power and to scrap the law that protect british family and their access to public service it be clear that it be only the conservatives who be on the side of the hard work british public last week with yorkshire colleague meet our local integrate care board to discuss plan for improve dentistry provision when surgery suddenly close to nhs patient without notice as one in harrogate do very recently an immediate strain be put on local provision will the prime minister look at what can be do in those circumstance to ensure no one be leave without access to an nhs dentist my hon friend be

patient may attend and practice should keep all their record up to date include whether they be accept new patient typically where practice end contract nhs england and icb should work together to ensure that funding be reallocate and patient continue to have access to nhs dental care call the snp leader as someone who spend more money heat their swimming pool than the total value of the uk state pension the prime minister think it be safe to say might not be as invest in this topic as some other but let we afford he the opportunity to clear up any confusion will he commit his party the conservative party to maintain the state pension triple lock beyond the next general election yes or no this be the party that introduce the triple lock this be the party that have deliver increase in the state pension since it be also the party that have ensure that there be few pensioner live in poverty today and that this winter pensioner will get an extra alongside their winter fuel payment to support they through the challenge time with inflation our track record be clear there be one party in this house that have always stand up for our pensioner and that be the conservative party do not think we hear yes there mr speaker you will imagine my shock my utter surprise that we appear to have consensus once again between the conservative party and the labour party on this most important of issue despite the promise that be make to the people of scotland in and despite clear statement from the like of gordon brown that the only way to protect pension be to remain within the uk how hollow

reliance on dictator and increase our exposure to those market as independent report have say it would also be bad for the climate as import fossil fuel come with something like two or three time the

people who should be in prison be those who misgender people my hon friend be right to say that prisoner who be violent towards people work and live in prison will and should face the full consequence of their action be pleased that the recent police crime sentencing and courts act increase the maximum penalty to up to two year imprisonment for those who assault emergency worker that include prison officer the ministry of justice will continue to press for charge for more serious offence such as abh assault occasion actual bodily harm where appropriate at the weekend seven global economic power come together to agree monumental trade agreement they include india the united states and the european union but not the uk do the prime minister choose not to sign up because presumably he think it be bad deal or be the uk leave out altogether because he have as weak reputation on the world stage as he do at home be not sure whether the hon lady be here for the statement on monday but rather assume she be not what she describe be not trade deal so first she should get her fact right as explain on monday there be lot of different way in which country will participate in solve international issue at the same summit she mention we announce record investment in the green climate fund the single big investment by this country to help with international climate finance that be warmly welcome by country at the summit which can see that the uk be take leadership role and help country to adapt to and mitigate the impact of climate change this week we be hit by the devastating news that all

affect by the demise of wilko that he and the government will do everything in their power to help support people into job and make sure that their redundancy package and pension be protect and that we will take whatever action be available to we to hold the ownership to account as my hon friend know some of the topic he raise will be commercial matter for the company but do know that this be concern time for worker at wilko my right hon friend the business secretary be keep close to development and we have already start support those who have be make redundant and we stand ready to support other to the full of our ability the head of the army general sir patrick sanders have say that the uk must forge an army capable of fight alongside our ally and defeat russia in battle so why be the government still push ahead with further cut of troop to the british army again this be the government who have put record amount into our armed force billion we remain the second large investor in our defence in nato as we see at the nato summit other country look to we for leadership how the armed force allocate that record funding be matter for the chief to make sure that we have the capability we need to meet the threat of today that be decision that they will make and we will back they but no one can doubt our commitment to fund properly the armed force and ensure that we keep this country safe the prime minister have rightly say that democracy such as the uk not authoritarian regime should lead the fight on global challenge such as development and climate change give that the link between fail regime climate change and the number of asylum seeker be grow will my right hon friend ensure that do development democratically be key theme in the white paper on international development will he also visit the westminster foundation for democracy garden of democracy exhibition here in parliament which highlight our promotion of democratic value abroad thank my hon friend for highlight the exhibition in portcullis house member will have hear his invitation we be consult widely on the detail of the white paper on international development and what it should say and specifically on the role of democracy in development encourage all interested organisation and individual to share their idea through the public consultation may just say thank you to sir john benger in his final prime minister question for his loyal service to the house we do appreciate it thank you sir john combine sewer overflows urgent question to ask the secretary of state if she will make statement on combine sewer overflow with the usual courtesy welcome the hon member for croydon north steve reed to his place restate that have always be clear that the current volume of sewage discharge by water company be totally unacceptable and they must act urgently to improve their performance so that they meet government and public expectation confirm that the department the environment agency and ofwat have receive the information notice and will of course comply with their request we do not agree with the office for environmental protection assessment of our compliance with the law and the house should note that the oep itself have say we recognise that great deal be already be do to tackle the issue of untreated sewage discharge and we welcome the intent of government measure such as the plan for water and storm overflow target as well as commitment to increase investment the public be rightly disgust by sewage discharge from storm overflow and so be the government which be why we have take more action than any other government on the issue remind hon member that the european commission take the labour government to court in for breach of the law subsequently we have start the construction of the thames tideway tunnel which be due to be complete next year it be take decade to construct however decade ago the conservative lead government take action and start require the monitoring of storm overflow that work will be complete by the end of this year it be owe to that that the scale of the problem have be unveil note that in wales which be run by labour government discharge occurrence be much time year for outflow versus in england the environment act include new power and responsibility which increase understanding last year the department for environment food and rural affairs publish the storm overflow discharge reduction plan that lead to some of the action that we be take we have be repeatedly clear that water company reliance on overflow be unacceptable they must significantly reduce how much sewage they discharge as priority we be hold they to account and that be also true of our regulator remind the house that active investigation include an active criminal investigation of water company be under way we welcome the opportunity to set out the scale of the action that the government be take no government in history have do more to tackle the issue last year we launch the storm overflow discharge reduction plan our strict target will lead to the tough ever crackdown on sewage spill and we require water company to deliver the large ever infrastructure programme in water company history be therefore happy to answer today urgent question but say yet again that the conservative government be clean up the mess leave by labour government and we will get on with the job nothing more graphically illustrate year of fail tory government than the tide of raw sewage swill down our river into our lake and wash up on our beach the conservatives cut the environment agency budget in half that lead to drastic cut in monitoring enforcement and prosecution which lead to drastic increase in illegal discharge trash nature damage tourism and put kid health at risk this government be up to their neck in sewage crisis of their own making and now in an absolutely unprecedented move the office for environmental protection tell we that the government may have break the law themselves in allow all of this it identify possible failure to comply with environmental law by the secretary of state own department the environment agency and ofwat this government have break the entire regulatory system they enable this scandal but do we hear word of apology just now no we do not there be only complacency labour want severe and automatic fine for every illegal discharge to pay for tough regulation and enforcement regime why will the government not do that we want mandatory monitoring of every outlet so that the public know where the discharge be happen why will the government not agree to that can the secretary of state tell we which ministers sign off what the oep call misinterpretation of the law to allow more frequent sewage discharge without risk of sanction that be government sanction green light to pollute be it she what action will she now take to put an end to this appalling situation bring the water company to heel and clean up our waterway will she publish the correspondence between the oep and her department if she have nothing to hide finally if the secretary of state department be find to have break the law will she do the right thing and resign the prime minister would not tolerate raw sewage in his private swimming pool so why be he happy to treat the british countryside as an open sewer the risk for the hon gentleman be that he have already soil his own reputation by fail to acknowledge that the investigation that lead to that court case which be refer to in the information notice take place under labour government on sky last night believe it be former labour minister from the department for environment food and rural affairs who basically say that he know sewage discharge be happen and what do the labour government do about it they do not do anything in they set out consultation basically allow self monitoring by the water company frankly the labour government do sweet fa and we be clean it up now let we have look at the timescale that have be mention for the situation that lead to the ruling by the court of justice of the european union thing have not be do in wales where there be labour government so there be no change in policy there meanwhile the conservative government have get on with impose unlimited penalty on water company that be why so many power be put into the environment act and regulator be now use they there be hardly any monitoring in thank to labour the scottish national party do not have leg to stand on either and it be the conservatives who get the monitoring go where labour have weaken monitoring we have increase it on the assertion that the hon gentleman make about budget he should be aware that the purpose of the permit and of the fee that go with the permit be to pay for those regular inspection government funding which we increase last year be use when enforcement action need to be take and that include take company to court that be why there be an active criminal investigation under way now frankly it be the conservatives who get the monitoring go and unveil the scale of this while the labour government look the other way have no confidence in the plan that labour have put forward we be already get on with many of the action that it talk about and that be why we will sort out the mess that the labour government leave behind can we be more moderate in the language that we use do not think that it have be appropriate and hopefully we will hear no more of it call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee we all understand the long term challenge of storm water overflow where heavy rainfall be inundate the system over time we will see more storm water tank such as the million litre tank that yorkshire water instal in scarborough but there can be no excuse for discharge when the weather be dry some be down to human error or to mechanical failure but many be down just to under capacity in the system as we address the problem can we focus on the dry discharge and ensure that investment go where it will have the most effect where the most concentrated sewage go into waterway my right hon friend be right to point out some of the investment that be under way but the storm overflow discharge reduction plan which anticipate will receive nearly billion of investment from the water company will prioritise where the big issue be think that be the right thing to do be also mindful of other potential environmental responsibility particularly in area of conservation we will continue to ensure that as part of the plan we get on and get into the detail we be already do quite lot of work with the water company hold they to account and ensure that they get on and spend the money along with the water company one of the main source of water pollution in the south west be the minority of livestock farmer who put silage run off from silage and slurry into local waterway yet the government have radically cut the number of inspection and there have be hardly any prosecution why the right hon gentleman be former minister in defra be not aware of what inspection be do when he be in office what do know be that we increase funding for farm inspection my understanding be that there be about last year the approach be target sometimes farmer be not do it intentionally we be help in different way include by increase the funding for slurry infrastructure through the environmental land management scheme we be increase incentive to help with thing such as barrier strip and buffer strip so that stock be keep far away we be actively work with farmer we want they to be able to do the right thing enforcement be undertake he will be aware of recent case in herefordshire and we will continue to allow our regulator to make decision on criminal investigation independently rather than the government dictate they welcome the work of my right hon friend the secretary of state in this area despite what have be say today we have to recognise that this be the first government to take the bull by the horn and actually do something about illegally discharge sewage which have be happen for decade have witness it myself have recently be speak to southern water about river that my constituency happen to be near although recognise that southern water be do its very good to do small trial around land drainage frankly it be not do enough quickly enough will the secretary of state outline the power of the environment agency that she be strengthen in order to fine company such as southern water which as my right hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby sir robert goodwill say be use opportunity in dry weather to dump sewage where that really should not be happen my right hon friend be right to point out that we have take action and give power to the regulator very successful prosecution happen believe southern water be fin million in recent case we need to continue to work to get effective action have complete confidence in the environment agency in get on with the detailed work that we need to do to ensure that the water company stick to the law and we continue to strengthen the law include through the unlimited penalty that this house vote for actually think it be only government members who go through the division lobby to pass those penalty the secretary of state will know of the concern from her own mailbag as certainly do from mine my constituent be in touch with week in week out with concern about the river lune or the beach at fleetwood my constituent and would like to know what step the secretary of state will take to ensure that when water company break the law they will be punish and bring to justice and will not do it again be conscious of the breakdown near fleetwood early this year to give some credit to united utilities it work at pace to try to fix the mechanical failure that have happen we now have legislation that allow the environment agency to apply unlimited penalty she will be aware that live criminal investigation by the environment agency be under way against water company it will then be for the court to decide the scale of the fine we will continue to ensure that penalty be apply and clear instruction be give we have have discussion with the environment agency we need to get the problem fix but water company should not try to do this on the cheap and think that it be cheap just to pay penalty than actually sort out the problem sit on the bill committee for the environment act which create the oep also sit on the environmental audit committee which interview the now chair of the oep it be government members who introduce the oep enable she to do this work to find out the scale of the problem when the report refer to the government it be not be party political it be refer to all government for the past year or more do my right hon friend agree that we need to keep look at these report rip off the plaster that we have start to rip off and hold to the fire the foot of all the polluter that cause these problem in the first place my hon friend be absolutely right when we leave the european union we recognise the need to have suitable scrutiny which be what be in place clearly the oep have not come to conclusion about break the law that be why it have ask for more information that be its right and entitlement that be what we legislate to allow it to do and we will continue to comply with that meanwhile it will not distract we from get on with our plan for water and hold water company to account water company have dump sewage more than million time over the past three year now we find out that instead of stand up to the water company the government seem to have be complicit in let they break the law beyond the government own failure have this sewage crisis not be drive by under investment while billion be hand out to shareholder since privatisation be it not time to put an end to this racket and restore water as proper public service understand that the hon member come from the very left wing of the labour party and that that will continue to be his mantra understand however that it be not the position of his party to nationalise water because it recognise that about billion worth of investment have go into water infrastructure since privatisation clearly the scale of what need to be do in the next few year be considerably great than we have see before at the same time back in we have one of the big dividend go and the gearing of thames water be change frankly the labour government then do not do anything about it that be key to one of the situation that we face at the moment but meanwhile we will continue to get on be confident that with the thames tideway tunnel opening next year we will have good sewage channelling and will be able to deal with that in london the work continue include thing such as nature base management practice in order to help in yorkshire as well know that his water company be look into that too july last year be the hot day on record in the uk temperature exceed in some place during dry spell yet water company that respond to bbc investigation admit to so call dry spill of sewage that day the environment secretary be report as say that it do seem extraordinary but that the environment agency be the regulator give that it be the hot day when people be inadvertently bath in sewage why do the environment secretary wash her hand of it be conscious of the investigation that the bbc undertake the environment agency and the department do not agree with its assessment of the datum that do not mean of course that there have not be sewage spill on dry day that be why it be part of the investigation it be part of fix the problem and we will continue to do that the secretary of state know gill rider from history the chair of pennon group which own south west water have hear what the secretary of state have say but surely the time have come to get these company and their leadership under control south west water be disgrace it be leak it be treat its customer with utter contempt secretary of state please sit on these company and make they do the job that they be mean to which be to stop this now unlimited penalty be available to the environment agency and there be already criminal investigation under way know my hon friend have secure westminster hall debate next week to discuss it in further detail and my hon friend the water minister will reply substantially to the many detailed point that be sure he will raise it be my constituent mr latimer who be responsible for the law change state that sewage should only be discharge during exceptional circumstance he know as we all know that it be this government who be actively enable the water company and regulator to get away with dumping sewage into our river and our ocean why will the secretary of state not admit that under this government sewage dumping be no long the exception but the rule because the hon lady assertion be simply not true rather than just scaremongere which be what we be hear again from the opposition could we have focus please on the quality of our water in leigh on sea and southend west the quality of our water have go up from in to and the vast majority of our beach be rat good or excellent will my right hon friend applaud the work of local group the bluetits chill swimmers run by daniella bee and philip miller of adventure island who be assist in have regular sewage summit with anglian water we have extract promise from anglian water to eliminate of use of our combine storm overflow five year ahead of the government target be this local action not the sort of thing we should be do not just scaremongere my hon friend be right to praise the activity happen in her constituency and the people of southend should be congratulate on elect she to this house because she be an avid campaigner for they she recommend her part of the world for swim due to the designated beach and could do the same in my own constituency remind the house that when the conservatives come in to power in only half our swimming beach and designate bathing water be deem excellent thank to whatever happen under labour now it be more than three in four which show the progress we have make right around the country ask the secretary of state this pertinent question what do she say to the senior executive at yorkshire water who when complain about the quality of the water in some of the river in yorkshire say mr sheerman do you realise that there be no river in our country that be fit to swim in be it not the truth that the secretary of state pathetic performance today and her use of the most vulgar language have hear in this chamber in all my year in this house show that she be out of her depth that she be incompetent and that she should resign immediately look forward to the election in huddersfield the hon gentleman should look at some of his own speech do not know on what basis he have make that assertion quote the chief executive of yorkshire water but that be not the the hon gentleman can always contact directly to give the quotation and the source of the quotation look forward to receive it and will take the water company chief executive to task if that be truly what she say despite all we have hear from labour be it not the reality that in government labour do absolutely nothing on this issue with no monitoring in place and that it be this government as the oep recognise who be sort the problem through the plan for water through record investment and through monitoring improve water in north west norfolk and across the country my hon friend be absolutely right he have coastal constituency as well and will know the continue work to improve the quality of our designate bathing water and our water more broadly there have be more stringent standard apply over the last decade we continue to work to try to improve that and we will continue to get on with the job the secretary of state seem to have weird amnesia about the past decade or so so that there be big leap from labour be in government to she suddenly be in front of we today hope she do remember the many time whether in the environmental audit committee the environment food and rural affairs committee or the environment bill committee that ask she about make sure the office for environmental protection really have tooth be independent and be respect by government be concerned that there be already sign that the government be try to undermine the work of the oep will she assure we that she will respect the conclusion that it come to and act accordingly will say that we set up the oep we will comply with the information notice it have request and then we will see where its decision go from that it be important that that institution continue to have the freedom we give it we will continue to respect that and to comply with its notice as set out under the statute the water minister and regularly visit beach that have be subject to several environmental spill this august when check at the site it be storm overflow and not combine sewage outlet give that there be not enough rainfall to constitute an exceptional amount can the secretary of state advise why the environment agency have not take enforcement action against south west water and all the other water company that be spill sewage when there be no exceptional circumstance understand from my hon friend the water minister that the environment agency be currently investigate the source of the pollution to help with its investigation the right hon lady department issue statement say that it do not agree with the oep initial interpretation but will continue to work constructively with the oep on this issue that seem like contradiction to how do the secretary of state plan to work constructively with the oep when her department statement demonstrate complete disregard for environmental law the hon lady be incorrect we absolutely respect the law we introduce the environment act we can disagree with initial assertion but we will continue to ensure that we provide the information the oep have request thank the secretary of state for the renew determination to bring about improvement it be clear that we need it when we vote on this issue in the house we be give assurance that these incident would not take place it be clear that while official may not agree with this investigation there be still real cause for concern how do the secretary of state intend to alleviate those concern and more importantly ensure that sewage release be regulate and safe make this suggestion very respectfully stop the dividend to the chief executive and director would be method to encourage improvement by the water company who seem reluctant to make they be conscious that the hon gentleman be member for northern ireland constituency the oep remit extend to northern ireland although not to the welsh labour government or the scottish snp government investigation can be undertake that be what we legislate for in this house and unlimited penalty can be apply that be true in england we will continue to make sure that we do what we can not only to reduce these challenge but to fix the long term issue we know that in london for example the thames tideway tunnel have take decade that be the scale of the issue the fact that we know about the scale of the issue right now be due to the conservative government have take action while the labour government look the other way the last time ask about the dumping of sewage in our river in this chamber the prime minister agree with that it be absolutely unacceptable however the oep investigation be scandalous revelation that show the entire water and regulatory system be break what do the secretary of state think should happen to company regulatory body and government departments that knowingly break the law we set up the oep and it have the power thank to this conservative government to get on with the role as it see fit it be do so it have start the investigation and ask for more information and we will comply with that say to the hon lady as say at the start of my response to the urgent question that this be completely unacceptable by the water company that be why we be take action and get on with the job we do not need lesson from labour who look away and do nothing they be the people who be take to court by the european commission for failure failure failure thank to labour on point of order mr deputy speaker know that the secretary of state be under great pressure today she seem to be out of her depth in quite shallow water but she misquote in question ask few moment ago say senior executive of yorkshire water do not say the chief executive of yorkshire water that be on the record and hansard will show it want an apology from the secretary of state that stand on the record interruption secretary of state do you wish to respond far to that point of order mr deputy speaker think that the hon gentleman say the chief executive hear now that he say senior executive but the point still stand provide the quotation provide the source and will take it up with that executive and the chief executive of yorkshire water because frankly that be not acceptable thank you very much secretary of state for respond to the urgent question we will now move on asbestos

year ago in this place when my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch and be try to get the government into the sensible and correct place on the issue of compensation represent an area with many former steelworker power station worker docker and few miner so respiratory industrial disease be an issue that know well include from my close family increasingly the disease be not restrict to role that involve directly instal material with asbestos it also affect those who work in building with asbestos such as teacher indeed teacher be more likely to die from mesothelioma than the general public sadly have hear example of that from my constituent government survey find that of participate school have asbestos on their estate and although most have plan for deal with it that figure speak for itself thank in particular my hon friend the member for loughborough jane hunt who apart from be an excellent champion for her constituent have do incredible work lead up to this minute rule motion include her recent westminster hall debate on asbestos in the workplace as most people will be aware asbestos be naturally occur mineral that be use extensively in building in the uk and around the world between the and it can be find in ceiling tile pipe insulation floor textured paint and boiler and it be often mix with other material which make determine its presence even more complex in fact asbestos be one of three material consider so hazardous that they require their own regulation the other be radiation and lead lead and radiation be tightly control and although there have be lot of work over the year to tighten regulation on asbestos and indeed to ban it many would say that it remain the poor relation of the three material in public policy term the scale of the problem can not be underestimate the health and safety executive have say that between and building in the uk contain asbestos other estimate suggest million tonne of asbestos be spread across million building in this country asbestos be of course the single great cause of work relate death in the uk hse estimate that more than people die from asbestos relate cancer each year of whom half die from mesothelioma government of both side have seek to address that issue we have have ban on import use manufacture and supply the control of asbestos regulations provide framework for work with asbestos in non domestic premise the regulation be welcome as they place requirement on duty holder to assess the presence condition and exposure risk of asbestos in non domestic premise the duty holder be require to maintain an up to date register and share it with anyone who may be at risk of exposure or of disturb asbestos contain material however as welcome as those regulation and other intervention may be there remain too many new mesothelioma case in the uk and there be clear trend of rise case among those who have work in building with asbestos rather than among those who work directly with asbestos product and material report by alpha tracker on the condition of asbestos in school hospital and home find that more than half of million sample find to contain the material be already damage that of asbestos contain material in hospital and healthcare setting have high damage and that of asbestos in school be in poor condition we must therefore ask if the current approach be work and sufficient the uk national asbestos register new social enterprise establish to help management and duty holder to manage the material have identify five common failing in the current system first there be communication failure contractor rarely see an asbestos register or record be mislay or difficult to access contractor undertake what seem like minor work for example may be unaware there be acm in that building and that they might disturb they secondly information be provide in format that be difficult to understand poorly arrange or too lengthy mean that document be often incomprehensible thirdly register be not update as work be undertake mean that information be out of date or the information be hold on different database as contractor change information can be lose fourthly the current system often result in there be no evidence of compliance or confirmation that any register have be access and read by contractor or anybody undertake work fifthly although asbestos register contain the same basic datum they be arrange in different format which make they more difficult to understand andrew paten one of the founder of the uk national asbestos register say standard common format would allow everyone to become familiar with they and competent in their use regardless of the property as highlight in the work and pensions committee the health and safety executive approach to asbestos management report and in mesothelioma uk do let the dust settle campaign the introduction of national asbestos register would go long way towards solve those issue and be necessary if the management in situ approach of recent decade which make good sense in many way as oppose to blanket removal be to be maintain believe that national register of the type propose be absolutely crucial recognise that question and concern will be raise about how such national register would operate it would bring together all the exist information on building with acm into one coherent database as have say it be currently piecemeal and fragmented not only make it easy for duty holder to record and maintain information about asbestos in their building but make the information more easily accessible for those who require it there would be wide benefit to national register it would help to support long term strategic approach to manage asbestos if we have learn one thing in recent week in respect of concrete it be that access to information and clear datum be absolutely necessary when manage any risk in building access by the public furthermore national register would increase public awareness of the harmful effect of asbestosis something that mesothelioma uk believe be crucial to protect future generation and for well treatment and care for those who suffer from asbestos relate condition such register would also ensure that the health and safety executive could use that database to well target and improve its own enforcement effort in this area as have say recent issue with school building condition in relation to concrete have show we that we need to be proactive rather than reactive when it come to manage risk of this kind at the moment there be no simple and cost effective way to reverse our legacy of use these material in non residential building but we can not ignore the fact that we have grow number of mesothelioma case among those who have work not just with but within building that contain those material that be why well asbestos management be need and national register be key to provide that question put and agree to order that andrew percy jane hunt tracey crouch sir stephen timms martin docherty hughes ian lavery holly mumby croft and ben lake present the bill andrew percy accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday november and to be print bill procurement bill lords programme no motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the follow provision shall apply to the procurement bill lords for the purpose of supplement the order of january procurement bill lords programme consideration of lords message proceeding on the lords message shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion two hour after their commencement subsequent stage any further message from the lords may be consider forthwith without any question be put the proceeding on any further message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their double question agree to procurement bill lords consideration of lords message schedule discretionary exclusion ground beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment it be an honour once again to open the debate on this important bill which be delighted to say be now so close to receive royal assent the bill be key brexit benefit deliver simple more transparent procurement framework that will benefit small business and meet the need of uk supplier and contracting authority colleague in the chamber will also hope remember that when the bill be last debate in this house we offer significant new measure to protect the uk public procurement supply chain from threat to national security those include new ground to add supplier to the debarment list for particular type of contract that will allow we to ban risky supplier from bid for those contract the creation of new national security unit for procurement that will provide dedicated resource in the cabinet office to scrutinise national security risk in procurement and commitment to publish timetable for removal of surveillance equipment supply by company subject to the national intelligence law of china from government department sensitive site early this week in the other place we go far my noble friend baroness neville rolfe provide an official clarification of the definition of sensitive site and commit to an annual write report detail progress be sure this house will welcome our additional agreement and agree that they demonstrate the government unwavere dedication to tackle these issue seriously will deal today with one amendment that the other place send back to this house on the subject of organ harvesting let begin by say that think all side of this house be in complete agreement that organ harvesting be dreadful practice that have no place in our supply chain the question before we today be whether lords amendment be the right or necessary one to make give other provision in the bill in committee in this house the government remove discretionary exclusion ground for supplier engage in force organ harvesting the other place have subsequently propose an amendment in lieu with some modification of the original amendment this new version of the lords amendment do not cover unethical activity relate to human tissue it do however still cover force organ harvesting and deal in device equipment or service relate to force organ harvesting urge this house to reject this amendment for number of reason first as have say previously do not believe that the amendment be necessary as crucially organ harvesting be already deal with under exist provision in the procurement bill under the bill any supplier fail to adhere to exist ethical or professional standard that apply in their industry include those relate to the removal storage and use of human tissue could be exclude on the ground of professional misconduct it be worth add at this point that as far as his majesty government be aware no supplier in the uk public sector have be involve in force organ harvesting this mean that it be very unlikely that any of our public money be be spend on that terrible practice as note above however if such situation do arise the exclusion for professional misconduct would apply secondly the amendment have significant consequence for contracting authority it extend to supplier deal in any device or equipment or service relate to force organ harvesting that be an incredibly broad provision that would be extremely difficult for contracting authority and supplier to verify in respect of all supply chain and customer basis if there be any doubt about whether that discretionary ground apply local authority or nhs trust would need to undertake significant due diligence to satisfy themselves that the entire supply chain and the end user of all good provide by supplier potentially include oxygen mask it equipment and so on be not use in these terrible practice it would mean that small business tender for government contract would need to understand where their customer might be use or sell their product to enable they to genuinely and legitimately confirm that they be not subject to this ground more generally the amendment would create excessive bureaucracy require each and every supplier bid across the thousand of contract award by contracting authority each year to declare that they be not guilty of force organ harvesting when we know that there be no evidence of that horrific practice occur in uk public sector supply chain we believe that such burden would be unjustified when the bill already cover this issue thirdly the government be already take step to tackle the issue of organ harvesting we have be explicit that the overseas organ trade or complicity with it will not be tolerate for example by virtue of the health and care act it be already an offence to travel outside of the uk to purchase an organ in addition the government continue to monitor and review evidence relate to report of force organ harvesting in china and maintain dialogue with lead non governmental organisation and international partner on this very important issue this bill create new rule for supplier and contracting authority that will hopefully stay on the statute book for many decade to come apologise for be slightly delay mr deputy speaker do not see this debate pop up on the annunciator rush to ask question about this topic forgive on the issue of organ harvesting understand the difficulty with this particular amendment so while be instinctively supportive of what the lords be try to do understand the government argument however there be way to tighten this up organ harvesting be take place in china it be regular occurrence but would not rely too much on declaration from supply chain we have already unearth the problem that supply chain be under no obligation to do the due diligence that would enable they to know whether company or the people they be trade with have any involvement with organ harvesting tighten that up would be great on that basis do my hon friend accept that we now have to make sure that china be on the enhance tier of the foreign agent registration scheme that would really put power in the government hand to make sure that supply chain be properly check will he say to our right hon friend the prime minister and to all those concerned that it be time we do so china be genuine threat to we industrially as well as politically my right hon friend be an expert on these matter thank he for his intervention have to say that be quite surprised that he be not sit behind when stand up in the first place but be delighted to see he in the chamber now be sure that my right hon friend the prime minister will have hear his remark and will consider they carefully this be obviously procurement bill and we be do our good to create the post brexit framework that will give we an enhance ability to improve all aspect of procurement in our society in committee and on report in this house we think it be necessary to tighten up national security consideration to make sure that foreign hostile actor could not get involve in public procurement we have as my right hon friend know because he give we good advice take step to make sure that we remove technology that come from those hostile actor from sensitive site on the broad point he make at the end of his comment that be beyond my pay grade but have no doubt that those above my pay grade have hear what he have say this be an excellent bill it be tribute to the official who have work on it and to my predecessor who work on it in the cabinet office therefore urge the house to reject the amendment make by the other house and support the government motion call the shadow minister come in as do at the tail end of the passage of this bill would like to take this opportunity to thank my predecessor my hon friend the member for vauxhall florence eshalomi for all her work on the bill and to say that look forward to work constructively with the minister turn to the government motion to disagree with lords amendment we can all agree that force organ harvesting practice involve the removal of organ from living prisoner that result in their death or near death be abhorrent the debate on this government motion be about whether there should be specific clause in the bill to make it clear that we do not want to see single penny of taxpayer money go to any company link to this practice or whether that be adequately cover by the concept of professional misconduct that can be use against serious unethical behaviour we hear powerful speech in the other place from lord alton of liverpool and lord hunt of kings heath who make compelling argument for the inclusion in the bill of the measure against force organ harvesting and provide evidence of the practice take place in china thank my hon friend the members for vauxhall and for st helens south and whiston ms rimmer for all they have do to highlight the issue furthermore the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights have state that serious human right violation have be commit in the xinjiang uyghur autonomous region allegation of torture include force medical treatment be credible this be very current issue and we would like to see specific mention of it in the bill first include specific reference to force organ harvesting in the bill will highlight the issue and send message to potential supply company to make specific check that they be not inadvertently in any way associate with the abhorrent business of force organ harvesting secondly although the minister have say that force organ harvesting be already cover by the ground of professional misconduct which include serious unethical behaviour specific mention of it in the bill will highlight to those undertaking procurement to be particularly vigilant in respect of any potential association of supply company with this appalling practice thirdly make specific mention of force organ harvesting help to send clear message to china and anywhere else it may occur that the practice will not be tolerate and that there will be economic consequence the minister have object to have specific mention of force organ harvesting because it mean additional paperwork and we all want to cut down the amount of paperwork that company have to deal with however would suggest in this case that small amount of additional work be well worth it if it send strong message of condemnation strengthen awareness of the issue and hasten the end of this abhorrent practice the opposition support the position take by the other place of include the measure on force organ harvesting in the bill and will therefore vote against the government motion to disagree with the lords amendment call the snp spokesperson it be pleasure to be here talk about lords amendment for the second day in row be glad to see the procurement bill make progress and get towards become legislation as the minister have comment on number of occasion we have not get to the place that he want in relation to his conversation with the scottish government about the bill to be fair we have also not get to the place we want for the bill neither of we be entirely happy with the position that have be reach but do appreciate the work that have be do to communicate between the government on this both try to find compromise solution but it be just impossible on this occasion to come to one that we be both happy with specifically on the government motion to disagree with lords amendment on force organ harvesting the hon member for llanelli dame nia griffith have lay out number of very important point and do not want to go over those the minister have say there be an absence of evidence that there be any force organ harvesting in any of the supply chain involve in uk procurement and do appreciate that that be case however if the government be able to find out that there be an absence of evidence on this surely it should not be beyond the mean of those procure or of company supply or buy thing that be bid for government procurement contract to find out that their supply chain be not involved if the government be able to find out these thing surely those company should the point make by the hon member for llanelli about raise awareness be incredibly important we have work very hard with company through the change in various act include improve company corporate social responsibility and require they to make modern slavery statement we have work hard to ensure that company be take their social responsibility seriously and therefore do not think that this measure be unreasonable it would not apply to all company it apply only to company bid for government contract surely we want company bid for government contract to ensure that they be as within the law as possible uphold human right and demonstrate corporate social responsibility do not think it be unreasonable for we to ask those company to look into their supply chain and consider whether they be financially support organisation or company that be involve in force organ harvesting think it be reasonable for we to ask they to spend little bit of time do this if they expect to take on government contract actually it be simple even than that in america first it be an offence for company to have falsify knowingly or unknowingly its declaration on supply chain secondly the us government use company such as oritain that use criminal science to test where product be make and whether declaration be correct and they be therefore able to enforce they what be happen be that those supply chain be now be rigorously declare by american company that do not wish to lose government business it would not be too much to ask the government to do spot check use such company that be available to they and have recommend it to the foreign office not that that really matter think the right hon member make reasonable and proportionate suggestion although we disagree on lot of thing be very surprised to find myself agree with he for the second time this week on this do appreciate his suggestion and hope those on his front bench be listen to the advice he have give be not go to test the house patience by drag this out we will be vote with the labour party against the government motion to disagree because we believe that the more stringent control be something it be absolutely reasonable for we to ask of company this be not for all company as have say but just for those that hope to get government contract in this week of all week the house need to show that our democracy be strong and that we be not intimidate by other nation the chinese communist party have show that it hold our democracy in contempt today we have an opportunity to put tough talk into action force organ harvesting be systemic trade that be take place on an industrial scale in china up to of its citizen be butcher each year for their organ this be state sponsor crime against humanity the two or three organ harvest from healthy young adult be worth over evidence of this crime have be extensively investigate by the china and uyghur tribunal chair by sir geoffrey nice kc the former lead prosecutor at the hague at the tribunal evidence be hear of systematic medical testing of thousand of prisoner of conscience allow the oppressive regime to create an organ bank have speak extensively on the horror that have occur due to force organ harvesting in previous stage of the bill so now will address some of the concern that the government express in the other place when oppose the amendment the government claim that force organ harvesting will be cover by exist provision of the bill certain conduct will absolutely not be cover by the exist provision on professional misconduct supply chain can be complex and improper conduct may often be one step too far remove from the crime for professional misconduct element to be make out try to cover all the different ethical and professional misconduct regulation across multitude of industry be not practical only by have specific provision for force organ harvesting will we ensure that british taxpayer money be not fund this horrific trade otherwise it will be all too easy for company to hide behind complex supply chain the second issue that the government raise in the other place be that there be no evidence of uk organisation facilitate force organ harvesting yet there be company with substantial operation in the uk provide immunosuppressive drug for transplant in china there be evidence of company dramatically raise their stake in the chinese market over the past few year source on the ground claim that cellcept an immunosuppressive drug have be use on chinese prisoner for transplant there be no evidence that those individual consent that be why clear and direct provision relate to force organ harvesting be necessary uk taxpayer money should not inadvertently be support this inhumane trade perpetrate by the chinese communist party there must be the ability or at least the option to stop it the amendment be not ask for draconian action it simply give discretionary power to exclude supplier from procurement contract if there be connection to force organ harvesting that would give the government the ability to act to prevent the complicity of uk taxpayer in force organ harvesting the amendment must be see in the context of our country wide relationship with china the government have extensively talk tough about stand up for our value against china china be trading partner that we can not ignore or close ourselves off to but that do not mean that we should not take such opportunity as this amendment to do right by our value and by humanity only couple of day ago the prime minister tell the chinese prime minister that attempt to undermine british democracy be completely unacceptable and that we will defend our democracy and our security the amendment give we the opportunity to use our democracy the democracy that they seem to hold in contempt to stand up for our value against china urge colleague across the house to take this opportunity to send clear message to the chinese communist party in this week of all week that this house will stand up for our value by keep lords amendment in the bill with the leave of the house thank all member who have make point in this important debate let remind colleague that the exclusion ground in the bill have be select in the area of great risk to public procurement return to the point make at the start there be fortunately no single know instance of such practice in the uk public procurement chain we do not see it as great risk to public procurement welcome the hon member for llanelli dame nia griffith to her place and her new role and look forward to debate with she and work with she in the week and month ahead the hon lady mention the world health organisation the government regularly discuss allegation of organ harvesting with the who and also with other international partner and human right ngos minister in the foreign commonwealth and development office write to the who in geneva to encourage it to give careful consideration to the finding of the china tribunal on organ harvesting in march very much do not want the house to get the impression that we do not take this seriously it be feature of our diplomacy and our work where we be co operate with like minded nation that abhor this practice number of member raise point about professional misconduct the exist provision relate to professional misconduct apply where supplier fail to adhere to ethical or professional standard that apply in their industry or where the supplier be engage in professional misconduct that bring into question their integrity assure the house that practice involve the removal storage and use of human tissue that be either illegal or contrary to ethical professional standard will be cover it be therefore unnecessary to single out that particular practice in the bill the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman speak on number of issue it remain sadness for the government that the scottish government choose not to be part of this bill leave scotland out of this new procurement regime and deprive small and medium sized enterprise in scotland of the advantage that will come they will also sit outside the new security measure that we have introduce but that be matter for the scottish government and hope that scottish voter be listen and that as this bill go through they realise the opportunity that their government have choose to deprive they of the hon lady raise an issue about the scope of government contract we be deal with many contract from many different layer throughout public procurement which could be such thing as grass cut service in local authority with the amendment we would be ask small and medium sized enterprise to conduct level of diligence that go way beyond their need and expertise that be disproportionate burden to place on they if we put too many burden on small and medium sized enterprise we may discourage those business from apply for public contract which be one of the precise and specific aim of the bill we have billion worth of public procurement every year want to see small and medium sized enterprise in england wales and northern ireland get big bite of that pie as be sure do you mr deputy speaker understand that snp members will vote against this bill that they be not part of which be afraid speak to their peculiar constitutional mindset to the point make by my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith remind he that if anybody falsify their procurement declaration that would be ground for exclusion under the bill we therefore believe that that point be cover off commend the hon member for st helens south and whiston ms rimmer again on everything she have do to shine light on these terrible crime she be always at the forefront of these debate and ensure that the plight of people in china be hear in the house to her point say again that if we be to specify this one crime of which we have find no evidence in uk supply chain we would also be invite long list cover every conceivable misconduct in vain attempt to provide certainty on specific issue that would create large bureaucratic burden which be precisely what we be try to get away from in the bill however reassure she again that have look at this over and over again we believe that the exist professional misconduct exclusion ground will cover that and help contract authority to do their bit to ensure that we do not have supplier in our supply chain who be involve in those abhorrent practice hope that we can move this vital bill step close to royal assent the house have make its view clear once before and ask that it make its view clear second time question put that the house disagree with lords amendment the house proceed to division order deferred division be go on in the no lobby that will be pause while this division take place and will resume after it be over with injury time of about minute so that those who have not vote in the deferred division will get an opportunity to do so bim afolami nickie aiken peter aldous lee anderson stuart anderson caroline ansell edward argar sarah

alex burghart be the chair of the committee that three be the quorum of the committee that the committee do withdraw mann committee to withdraw immediately reason to be report and communicate to the lords economic crime and corporate transparency bill consideration of lords message must draw the house attention to the fact that financial privilege be engage by lords amendment if that lords amendment be agree to will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter in the journal dame margaret hodge have table two manuscript amendment to lords amendment which have be select by mr speaker paper will be distribute as soon as possible the deferred division have now resume in the no lobby and injury time have be add but member do not have long after clause register of member information to be include and power to obtain it beg to move that this house agree with lords amendment and with this it will be convenient to discuss the follow lord amendment and government motion to disagree and government motion to insist on amendment lords amendment government motion to disagree manuscript amendment and and government motion to insist on amendment it be always pleasure to speak with right hon and hon member on the economic crime and corporate transparency bill which they will know be close to my heart and contain many vital measure for which have long campaign the bill will give we the power we need to crack down on those who abuse our open economy while ensure that the vast majority of law abide business can grow and flourish be grateful that both houses have reach agreement on several issue include those relate to the register of overseas entity and on remove the extension of the failure to prevent offence to money laundering however we be here today as agreement be still outstanding on handful of remain issue urge this house to accept the government amendment to settle those remain topic and ensure that we can proceed to royal assent and implementation of these important reform without delay will now speak to those remain topic in the other place the government table two amendment on nominee shareholder amendment and in lieu of commons amendment and in response to lord vaux amendment on this topic from report stage in the other place the government amendment will allow the secretary of state to make regulation to make further provision for the purpose of identify person with significant control in case where share be hold by nominee this will allow the government to work with relevant stakeholder to target the regulation in an effective and focus way that do not impose disproportionate burden member of the other place agree with the government proposal and trust that member of this house will therefore agree with it today lord amendment and would apply the exemption from the failure to prevent fraud offence to micro entity only rather than the government position of exclude all small and medium sized enterprise the government appreciate that lord garnier have move close to the government position in agree to the principle of apply threshold however our position remain that such an amendment would still incur significant cost to business reduce the exemption threshold to only micro entity would increase one off cost for business from around million to billion the annual recurrent cost would increase from million to over million where do those figure come from we use very similar analysis to that use for the failure to prevent bribery and failure to prevent tax evasion offence we have use common methodology have not see any figure that contradict our figure here but in my view have run business and deal with some of the failure to prevent bribery provision there be no doubt that there be significant cost there may be external consultant to bring in for example even if one be compliant one might not know whether one be compliant so there be definite associate cost to ensure that reasonable effort be make to prevent fraud as it would be in this case those cost would still be disproportionately share by small business owner when law enforcement can attribute and prosecute fraud more easily in these small organisation and as have set out before we must be mindful of the cumulative impact on sme across multiple government requirement and regulation in all the work have do in the past from the back benches on failure to prevent it be invariably the case that all case involve large business not sme large company have the resource and specialist expertise to cope with additional burden whereas small business often have to dedicate significant amount of time and resource often pay for external professional advice to assess what new rule would mean for they that be the case even where they subsequently assess that they already have adequate control in place that be time and resource that could otherwise have be use to grow and generate wealth for their business and job for their staff the government be extremely mindful of the pressure on company of all size include sme and therefore do not feel it be appropriate to place this new unnecessary burden on over business therefore urge member of this house to support the government motion to disagree with the lords amendment to ensure that we take proportionate approach and do not impose unnecessary measure that would curb economic growth turn to lords amendment make by lord faulks on cost protection for law enforcement in civil recovery case the government remain of the view that the amendment would be significant departure from the loser pay principle and therefore should not be rush into without careful consideration there be no clear evidence that such change would help to achieve their intended aim of increase the capacity of law enforcement to take on more civil recovery case there have be no adverse cost ruling against an enforcement authority carry out this type of civil recovery in the past six year cost be just one of many factor that determine whether law enforcement will take on case for example the evidence available to pursue case particularly where evidence be require from overseas often prove more vital to an operational decision there be already number of way in which an enforcement agency liability to legal cost can be protect under the civil procedure rule in england and wales for instance rule give the court discretion as to the payment of cost by either party include whether they be payable to another party the amount and when they be payable in addition cost cap order can be apply for under rule to limit any future cost that party may recover under later cost order if we be to introduce further legislation we must consider what gap this be try to fill we should also consider civil liberty and property right that underpin our economy we will potentially be hand huge power to the state which could be hold over an individual the government recognise the potential merit of reform which be why we have add to the bill statutory commitment to review the payment of cost in civil recovery case in england and wales by enforcement authority and to publish report on the finding before parliament within month therefore hope that member of this house will agree with the government position today in conclusion encourage this house to agree with the government position on the outstanding lords amendment it be vital that we achieve royal assent without delay so that we can proceed to implement the important reform in the bill as quickly as possible it be great honour to speak for the opposition on behalf of myself and my hon friend the member for aberavon stephen kinnock pay tribute to my predecessor my hon friend the member for feltham and heston seema malhotra be also grateful to my right hon friend the members for barking dame margaret hodge and for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne my hon friend the member for rhondda sir chris bryant and many other across the house who have play such an important role in get the bill to this point by the government own definition economic crime refer to broad category of activity involve money finance or asset the purpose of which be to unlawfully obtain profit or advantage for the perpetrator or cause loss to other it pose threat to our country national security our institution and our economy and cause serious harm to our citizen and society failure to act allow criminal to benefit from the proceed of their crime and to fund further criminality in the most extreme case we have see the funding of organise crime group terrorist activity drug dealing and people traffic economic crime have many victim for too long the government have turn blind eye to corruption and dirty money allow russian illicit finance to flood into our country and let putin crony stash ill get gain and even recycle the proceed of crime into luxury property across our city more than two third of english and welsh property hold by foreign shell company do not report their true owner research by the london school of economics and warwick university show that the register of overseas entity be not fully effective for of those property essential information about their beneficial owner remain miss or publicly inaccessible despite the register of overseas entity it be not enough and we need more action after the grenfell tower fire disaster which claim life we have learn more about freeholder hide behind offshore trust and labyrinthine company structure to make it impossible for leaseholder to uncover who be responsible for replace dangerous flammable cladding hundred of thousand of people across the country be live in fear of grenfell style fire in unsafe block while some owner hide abroad under company structure that help they to dodge pay for replacement cladding by set up company and trust in overseas territory lack transparency our government and our citizen must be able to access information about who own what and where responsibility lie this legislation be long overdue as far back as the then security minister the right hon member for wyre and preston north mr wallace be report to have say that the bbc hit series mcmafia be very close to the truth and condemn the impunity with which some of these people operate and the brutality of it he promise new power to crack down on gangster criminal and corrupt member of the global elite with the full force of government to be use against they while some step have be take it take russia invasion of ukraine for the government to step up and introduce further legislation the government have delay legislation for too long and in that time money have be lose economic crime have persist and the uk economy have once again lose out shamefully our city our capital have take on the reputation of clean up much of the world dirty money the illegal russian invasion of ukraine have merely highlight shameful situation that campaigner have long decry for year the uk have be awash with cash from kleptocrat and oppressive regime transparency international uk have highlight that billion worth of property have be buy with the use of suspicious wealth recently visit ukraine where witness the terrible impact of the russian aggression on the civilian population who be constantly live in fear of airstrike it be sicken to think that the people who be responsible for these atrocity today could be enjoy luxury apartment and house in belgravia and mayfair just stone throw from this house however it be not just the kremlin as the times have report more than million worth of uk property be own by the child of notorious ruler and their henchman from fail state and autocracy around the world the cost of economic crime be as much as billion there be much to do law enforcement must be back up we must have the transparency that justice demand and send clear signal that there can not be dark corner where kleptocrat can stash their money the bill be starting point not an end point we will be hold the government foot to the fire to ensure that this legislation make an actual difference crucially tackle economic crime require support for key institution such as the national crime agency his majesty revenue and the customs crown prosecution service it be not enough just to introduce legislation we need enforcement and we need these institution to be properly resource and support we have have the fincen file the panama paper and the paradise paper as well as numerous inquiry by select committees include the treasury committee on which serve for number of year but we have see only incremental change which be very frustrating for many member on both side of the house further action be need to ensure transparency in respect of the ownership of uk property by overseas company and on compensation for victim of economic crime there remain huge gap however we welcome the change that the government have make in relation to strategic lawsuit against public participation which have be work on by number of member we support lords amendment and and welcome lord garnier focus on the failure to prevent fraud in non micro entity we also support lords amendment table by lord faulks as he have explain subsection should state that the court should not normally make an order that any cost of proceeding relate to case to which this section apply and so on my right hon friend the member for barking have table an amendment to that lords amendment which have be accept and we accept the lords amendment on that basis this bill be almost over the line it have be improve since ministers first embark on it however there be much more to be do we hope we can ensure that enforcement take place once it be on the statute book so that dirty money can be expose illegal asset can be seize and action be take against those who be guilty of economic crime we must not have further delay in push for transparency and action in tackle economic crime this be an important bill and there be much good in it but be afraid that number of area require further attention now be not the time for discursive speech but regret to say that notwithstanding the good in the bill the government have fall into error in relation to the two lords amendment that they seek to reverse let say first that while measure to deal with failure to prevent offence be good idea this measure be too widely draw the minister make point about the burden of cost on small business but the definition of medium sized business be significant the risk be less to do with the size of business than with where it do its business and also its corporate structure one of the important thing we have learn from the united states be that failure to prevent offence be not simply about prosecute important though that is but also about change corporate behaviour do not hear word about that in the minister speech and think it might be well to reflect on it again lord garnier table an amendment to compromise on micro entity perhaps we should think again about third tier consist of medium sized as oppose to small entity that would not be unreasonable give that many medium sized entity do significant work abroad where there be some risk and give that the cost be tax deductible from profit urge the government to think again because have do so much good in the bill it will be shame if we weaken its enforcement by widen the net too much as for the cost cap when the minister say that no prosecution have be bring yet he do not add that that be because of their chilling effect people will not risk bring prosecution if their budget be go to be erode after the event by cost be award against they only yesterday in the house of commons have the pleasure of meet bill browder who have set out very clearly why that have be the case for number of year the serious fraud office try to bring prosecution few year ago and get its finger burn and there have be few prosecution since then this be about behaviour rather than outcome have to say with apology to the minister whom like and respect that the government have take an unduly restrictive and literalist approach to these matter it would be far well to find compromise to think again go back to the lords and see whether there be somewhere between lord garnier position and that of the government perhaps that third tier of the medium sized entity be way around this the government be commit to review of cost cap in month time but as my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland say the last time this come up what be there to review the evidence be there cost cap be chilling as the minister will see if he read the evidence give to the cambridge economic crime summit at which have the pleasure of speak last week it be overwhelmingly clear that not single one of the expert could understand the government position on this so ask they please to think again about it as well strongly very much with what the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill say let we just agree with the lords let we get on with this let we do this legislation and do it properly let say first that it be important for we to have as much information as possible about those who own company it be clear from all the evidence that have come before we that the lack of such information cause people to find way of hide their money and the uk have become magnet for that the minister have suggest that there will be significant cost to business but business be already do work on failure to prevent bribery as lord garnier say on monday there be clear read across it would be easy to add fraud to the current provision it would not be difficult and it would bring about an economic benefit the minister also suggest that economic growth would be hamper in some way but he himself have say that corporate offence of failure to prevent economic crime and money laundering would reduce the amount of money that be illegally shift out of the uk into foreign jurisdiction and increase the amount of tax that be pay official report february vol why do the minister now disagree with himself why do he disagree with statement that he have make in the past he know that this be an important measure and that this be an issue that we can deal with here today and it will be do we will not have to come back to it we will not have to keep debate it and the minister will be able to see that he have finish it off and do good job on the issue of adverse cost agree with what bill browder say in his evidence to the bill committee by not introduce such measure we be inhibit law enforcement when it come to economic crime we know that those on the other side of the equation who want to hide their money have plenty of it to throw at the good lawyer and at the good accountant to make thing look particular way if we be to be in this fight we need to give the law enforcement agency the resource that they require and cost capping be key element of that as say the previous time we debate these matter there be no need for review we need to get on with thing an election be come and we do not know when we will pass this way again the minister should accept the lords amendment and get on with the work shall be brief the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss repeat her phrase of last week and indeed we have pass this way again will resist the temptation to be too biblical today will simply reiterate to the my hon friend the minister the point that make last week lord garnier have move on the position in the lords and offer an olive branch to the government in the sense that this be different amendment it rightly now afford what in the opinion of many of we will be great protection for business what be be ignore in this debate be the fact that business that take reasonable measure will not be the subject of prosecution or investigation business that be not within this regime will not have that protection so there be cogent argument that fail to extend the failure to prevent offence to more business would leave they less well protect pray in aid the excellent speech by lord garnier and in particular his reference to the guidance that be issue to the bribery act which state to certain extent the level of risk will be link to the size of the organisation and the nature and complexity of its business but size will not be the only determine factor some small organisation can face quite significant risk and will need more extensive procedure than their counterpart face limited risk however small organisation be unlikely to need procedure that be as extensive as those of large multi national organisation herein lie the point the government at that point be take the view that it be the extent of external risk that matter not the size of the enterprise which beg the question what on earth be we do here why this change why this change from the policy of conservative government which be echo in the tax evasion failure to prevent offence of with the great of respect to my hon friend the minister whom respect utterly he know that share his passion for reform in this area it be no good citing at the last minute figure that simply do not accept have the veracity that he claim they do lot of the measure have already be take by business deal with tax evasion and bribery and say again that this be not fraud in general this be fraud with an intent to benefit the entity the company which be different beast altogether from fraud in general secondly on the cost cap lord faulks be absolute right to ask if not now when the reason that there have not be many case be that there have definitely be dampening effect on authority bring these civil proceeding the intention in the proceeds of crime act be for lot more use of part in civil proceeding but we have see that vanishingly irregularly we need more of those in order to burnish britain reputation as centre of clean money have listen carefully to my right hon and learn friend point he say few second ago that this would relate only to fraud that benefit the body concern paragraph of lords amendment also cover the body or an associate within that body provide service so this be not just about the benefit to the organisation itself will take that qualification be seek short cut because time be brief my hon friend be right to mention the agency point but it be still much narrow ambit of the offence than fraud in general that be the point would ask he to take away because be not persuade think the amendment should remain within the body of the bill as amend and will be vote accordingly mr deputy speaker be conscious that we must vote in five minute to remain in order so will simply say that economic crime be national security issue and should not be partisan issue in this house urge the minister to set aside the party political view that he be express and to go with the consensus that have be build not just in the house of commons but in the house of lords and in the non governmental organisation sector outside the right hon lady be right it be not just the party but the different side of the natural argument over authority libertarianism and civil right that be not divided be strong defender of the right to be presume innocent but there need to be rebalancing in this area where the criminal we be up against be very sophisticated and will use small company to get around this if they need to in the interest of try to get to the vote on time will close my speech but urge all member to please support the amendment propose by conservative in the house of lords which be eminently sensible rational and pragmatic be afraid that be go to disappoint the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge and speak very strongly against lords amendment and and refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be surprised at lord garnier lack of any conception of what it be like to run small business and the cumulative impact of government regulation thereupon the limit that be draw here will draw in all manner of business not least some eminent barrister who will fall foul of some of the number indeed the average town centre or city centre pub will be cover by these regulation such be their level of turnover and employee it be worry that be perhaps the only small business voice here and that there be not enough small business people in the house to point out the problem with this issue as the minister have say hundred of thousand of business will be draw into the net this be not necessarily about the compliance cost the kind of regulation that come with the prospect of criminal offence have chilling effect on small business speak as somebody who have own one for nearly year when the revenue health and safety or trading standard show up with some new regulation whole industry crank into place to terrify the owner of small business into some kind of compliance then along come the consultant the accountant the webinar and the newsletter tell we what we do and do not have to do all of this distract we from what we should be do which be try to create employment and wealth and pay tax to the rest of the country the other issue be that this misunderstand the dynamic of business of this size if business of this size be go to engage in fraud it be very possible more than likely actually that the principal will be the instigator of that fraud the idea that alongside all the other offence they should take step to prevent themselves from perpetrate fraud seem ridiculous add to those general difficulty be the specific one present by the heath robinson type calculation that every business will have to undertake every month add together how many employee there be and how many be employ in each month in year then take away the number you first think of and divide it by the number of month we be all go to have to do this every single month to work out whether we be above the threshold or not should we have the step should we not have the step it all seem particularly nonsensical we know that vast amount of this fraud take place in large company and they have the capacity and the wherewithal to deal with it if my hon friend really think that senior barrister whose turnover and asset will be more than the threshold should be take and show procedural step to avoid conduct fraud do not forget that they be sole practitioner then be afraid we have go through the look glass of what conservative member think be appropriate call barry gardiner in the interest of move to the vote will not speak in which case we come to the minister with the leave of the house welcome the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali to her place we work closely together on the treasury committee and it be pleasure to work across the house with she today also pay tribute to her predecessor the hon member for feltham and heston seema malhotra for her similar approach to the work we have do on this legislation thank all hon and right hon member for their contribution to this debate and their support for the government amendment make in the other place want to refer to number of point that have be raise today the shadow minister the hon member for bethnal green and bow refer to the government turn blind eye to the issue of economic crime but nothing could be far from the truth many of we have work on this cross party across the house from the back benches and now on the front benches and this be the second piece of legislation we have bring forward on economic crime in the past month these be groundbreake new measure this bill contain further reform to the register of overseas entities introduce in the previous legislation our legislation on strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp be world lead and we now have the failure to prevent offence which will speak to in moment the hon lady also refer to the resource make available to our law enforcement agency we be continue to invest in measure to tackle economic crime and we have increase the budget of the national crime agency year on year since its budget have now increase from the figure in and stand at just over million together the recent spending review settlement and private sector contribution through the new economic crime levy will provide million of funding over the spending review period and the levy be estimate to bring in million per annum start from this financial year there will be wide range review by the end of provide transparency on how the levy be perform against its original purpose include on how the money be spend exist effort will move at pace to enhance and far drive forward the unit in what be inevitably complex and lengthy operation in consider this legislation we have often debate the extra resource that we be determined to deliver for companies house and will pay for at least more people that be an incredibly important part of the bill my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill state very clearly that he feel the failure to prevent threshold be too widely draw and understand his point as say in my opening speech all the case have deal with in this place whether it be lloyds hbos read hsbc natwest or other have involve large organisation that turn blind eye to fraud or let it happen on their watch we believe it be right to strike balance between the offence crime prevention benefit and the burden place on business there be balance between risk and regulation and we want to make sure that the regulation do not put excessive cost on business my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland make similar point he cast doubt on the figure have in front of on the cost of the burden on business which we believe will be billion of implementation cost and around million of recurrent annual cost be happy to look at other cost and analysis but those be the figure before my right hon and learn friend make an interesting point that the threshold will facilitate economic crime in certain company but the lords amendment allow some company to be outside the rule be not sure how he can draw line to say that there will be economic crime in some company and not in other it be very difficult to draw line and we believe that draw line at large company be right line matter at point in business evolution as my hon friend will know from build his own business it cross line it be perfectly possible under the definition in lords amendment that company that satisfy the financial criterion will decide to go from nine employee to or and suddenly it cross into this world of pain the compliance people show up and the company need whole new process and procedure that come with employ that single extra person on top of all the other employment and safety regulation it be have to deal with set these threshold at level at which company can absorb the step up in responsibility and without disproportionate amount of cost seem critical do he agree do agree listen closely to my right hon friend remark he say he might be the only small business owner currently in the chamber but he be talk to one have own business for year grow it from small business to large one and absolutely agree that it be not just the legislation itself but its implementation and the requirement to implement prevention procedure as he put it that would almost create new industry of adviser to advise on what need to be do be they accountant or third party he be right to raise those concern on behalf of small and medium sized enterprise my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst ask about set the threshold at different level the small company threshold rather than the current micro company threshold the small company threshold be employer million of turnover and million balance sheet accord to companies house whereas we think employee threshold would be more appropriate that be where we differ but be happy to continue that conversation want to ask question that do not think be address last time we debate lords amendment and that do not think the government have address today what be the implication if there be an explicit threshold what far thought have the government give to the implication of put in threshold be they satisfied that some of the concern raise by opposition members and conservative back benchers have be take into account we be very clear that we believe we have the right threshold large company clearly have the capacity and the human resource and risk compliance department to mitigate these kind of risk whereas small and medium sized enterprise be rightly much more focused on drive their business forward which be very important to the economic health of our country think we have it right my hon friend make similar point in our previous debate on this issue and he make it very strongly the fact that both he and my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse have make that point today counterbalance some of the argument on the other side for extend the threshold far the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss speak about my previous comment think have be pretty consistent in everything have say in the house unless she can point to anything different have say from the back the shadow minister the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds laugh but have always be champion of the failure to prevent offence if member look back to the original bill which think be page long it be now nearly page long they will see that have be very keen to make sure that we listen to hon member on thing like the failure to prevent offence and the identification doctrine which both now feature in the bill all the case deal with on the back benches and indeed the information have see as minister show that the kind of fraud the law enforcement agency have not be able to prosecute be happen in large company not small company we believe that these circumstance be different from unexplained wealth order for which we obviously put cost cap measure in place of course unexplained wealth order be not process for take somebody asset from they they be process for freeze asset lord amendment be entirely different in my view there be definitely civil liberty issue in term of the power of the state versus the power of the individual this measure potentially deliver an imbalance of power between the state and the individual would be keen to have conversation with the very learn members in the chamber but they must understand that the state be powerful and well resource compare with the individual obviously there be some individual who be very well resource but we still operate on the presumption of innocence in this country and we have to be very careful that be why we want review to look into this and report back to parliament within month we have communicate with the national crime agency to ask for evidence on where it feel these measure be need all law enforcement agency want more power and more provision of course but have see no clear significant evidence from the enforcement agency that cost cap order would be need in this situation too have speak to bill browder and have speak to official about whether this measure be need in the uk regime member will be aware that mr browder principally look at the parallel with the us situation where adverse cost do not apply across the system member have talk about the chilling effect of such provision but there be potentially chilling effect on the other side of the equation yesterday meet barrister who defend people against such action and he be very concerned about the imbalance of power that would result have not see any significant evidence and be very interested in the evidence that my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst give to the cambridge crime symposium at which have speak in the past on whether this be need however be not aware of anything the justice committee or the law commission have do in this area it be important that we look at that kind of evidence before we implement these kind of measure the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge accuse of be party political be surprised she take that view have work on cross party basis from the back benches and as she know do the same from the front bench and will continue to do so to make sure that we get this legislation right in conclusion throughout the passage of the bill the government have work hard to get the balance right between tackle economic crime and ensure that the uk remain place where law abide business can flourish without unnecessary burden the motion table by the government today achieve that balanced and proportionate approach and therefore urge member on both side of the house to support they lord amendment and agree to after clause failure to prevent fraud motion make and question put that this house disagree with the lords in their amendment and and insist on its amendment hollinrake the house proceed to division will the serjeant at arm investigate the delay in the aye lobby bim afolami

proscribed organisations amendment order which be lay before this house on september be approve before get into the detail of the order take this opportunity to apologise to the house and to you mr deputy speaker for the fact that news of my decision which we be here to debate become public before the order be lay be grateful to hon member for their consideration of the order which will see the wagner group truly brutal organisation proscribe have just meet ukrainian interior minister klymenko be proud to reiterate the united kingdom commitment to ukraine as it resist and defeat putin war of aggression some terrorist organisation be currently proscribe under the terrorism act proscription be not only powerful tool for degrade terrorist organisation it send strong message about the uk commitment to tackle terrorist activity globally wagner group be terrorist plain and simple therefore propose amend schedule to the terrorism act by add wagner group also refer to as the wagner network to the list of proscribe organisation in refer to wagner group the order encompass all wagner activity across the globe for an organisation to be proscribe as the home secretary must reasonably believe that it be currently involve in terrorism as set out in section of the act if the statutory test be meet must then consider the proportionality of proscription and decide whether to exercise my discretion proscription be powerful tool with severe penalty it criminalise be member or supporter of proscribe organisation and wear article of proscribe organisation in way that arouse suspicion penalty be maximum of year in prison an unlimited fine proscription also support other disruptive activity such as immigration disruption and terrorist financing offence the resource of proscribe organisation be terrorist property and therefore liable to be seize the order build on sanction that be already in place against wagner group terrorist financing incur criminal rather than civil penalty which allow the government ultimately to forfeit terrorist property rather than just freeze an individual asset be support in my decision making by the cross government proscription review group and decision to proscribe be take only after great care and consideration give its wide range impact it must be approve by both houses great deal of carnage and blame can be lay at the foot of wagner group russian private military company which emerge follow russia illegal annexation of crimea and putin first illegal invasion of eastern ukraine in wagner have act as proxy military force on behalf of the russian state operate in range of theatre include ukraine syria central african republic sudan libya mozambique and mali they have pursue russia foreign policy objective and those of other government who have contract their service in the hour follow putin decision to invade ukraine wagner group be reportedly task with assassinate president zelensky they fail in that task thank to the heroism and bravery of the ukrainian security force wagner group describe themselves in heroic term even suggest revoltingly that they be saviour of africa that private military company remain illegal under russian law have never particularly concern putin putin can distort the truth to suit himself all he like but wagner group be terrorist wherever they go instability misery and violence follow with the house consent wagner group will therefore be proscribe have carefully consider all the evidence include advice from the cross government proscription review group have decide that there be sufficient evidence to reasonably believe that wagner group be concern in terrorism and that proscription be proportionate although be unable to comment on specific intelligence can provide the house with summary of wagner group activity which support the decision wagner group commit and participate in terrorism that be base on evidence of their use of serious violence against ukrainian armed force and civilian to advance russia political cause wagner group play central role in combat operation against ukrainian armed force to seize the city of popasna in may and during the assault on bakhmut which be largely occupy by russian force this year the horrific assault on bakhmut result in the virtual destruction of city that be once home to people those be innocent civilian whose home happen to be in the way of putin neo imperial ambition wagner employ the same inhumane and senseless tactic that russian force have previously use in chechnya kill innocent civilian and destroy an entire city in the process they barely show any more concern for the life of their own side defence intelligence have assess that up to convict recruit directly from russian prison on the promise of pardon and early release be kill within few month of the attack on bakhmut wagner relentless bombardment of bakhmut be one of the bloody episode in modern military history hon member will also be aware of multiple report that allege unbelievable brutality by wagner group commander against their own troop who retreat desert or otherwise refuse to carry out their leader murderous order the most notorious of those event the killing of purported deserter who be murder by sledgehammer blow to the head have even be glorify by wagner leader and russian ultra nationalists that macabre culture and brutality be indicative of an organisation that be more than just private military company there be reason for that it be terrorist organisation ukrainian prosecutor have accuse wagner group fighter of war crime near kyiv the tortured body of civilian be find with their hand tie behind their back in the village of motyzhyn visit ukraine last year in my role as attorney general and see at first hand those prosecutor unrelenting commitment to seek justice we stand with ukraine in that mission wagner group have also be implicate in serious act of violence in several country in africa un report publish in may this year implicate wagner in the massacre of at least people in the central malian town of moura in march include summary execution as well as rape and torture in june panel of expert convene by the un security council detailed atrocity in the central african republic include excessive use of force indiscriminate killing the occupation of school and loot on large scale include of humanitarian organisation despite their mutiny in june of this year and the report death of their leader yevgeny prigozhin last month wagner remain violent and destructive organisation proscription send strong message of the uk commitment to tackle terrorist activity and build on our exist cross government work to counter wagner destabilising activity their leadership recent feud with senior russian military figure be predictable consequence of putin disastrous decision to invade ukraine but it be fundamentally distraction from the fact that wagner continue to commit violent act around the world while putin regime waver over what to do with the monster that it create wagner destabilising activity only continue to serve the kremlin political goal be listen carefully to what the home secretary be say about the timeline for all this although certainly welcome this proscription the frustration be that it do not happen soon although she can not go into the detail of the intelligence that she have hear could she perhaps expand on why it have take this long because much of what she have say refer to and early why do we not we do this soon the decision have not be take in isolation it build on strong response to russia aggression in ukraine and wagner wide destabilising activity include extensive sanction decision on whether and when to proscribe particular organisation be take after extensive consideration and in the light of full assessment of the available information significant event have take place recently include the mutiny in june the alleged death of the core wagner group leadership in august and it be right that we consider the impact of those key event when take the decision the real fact remain that this group present serious risk to security around the world and their increase activity in ukraine affect european stability and our security which be why the case for action be now strong than ever wagner be vulnerable leadership vacuum and question about their future provide unique opportunity to truly disrupt their operation and the threat they pose that be why this house must proscribe wagner now this decision come after public call from president zelensky for international ally to take action and list wagner as terrorist organisation in do so we stand alongside our ally in estonia latvia lithuania and france whose parliaments have all call for wagner group to be label as terrorist organisation on the eu list of terrorist group we continue to work in close co ordination with the us which designate wagner under its transnational criminal organisation sanction programme early this year in formally proscribing we will be lead the international effort by take concrete legal action against wagner urge our ally to follow suit this decision demonstrate that the uk will maintain its unwavering support for ukraine in co ordination with our ally it show that we stand with the people of ukraine against russia aggression to conclude wherever wagner operate they have catastrophic effect on community worsen conflict and damage the reputation of country that host they wagner may be at their most vulnerable and russia military leader may be grapple to regain control of the organisation but the brutal method they have employ will undoubtedly remain tool of the russian state let there be no misunderstanding in whatever form wagner take we and our ally will pursue they we will expose they and we will disrupt they wagner be terrorist organisation and we must not be afraid of say so we will hold russia to account for its use of these malign group these international gangster and the destruction they bring around the world we will continue to support ukraine in the face of russia aggression and we will confront and challenge terrorism however and wherever it occur rise before we proceed must now announce the result of today defer division on the draft windsor framework enforcement etc regulation the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it the division list be publish at the end of today debate thank the home secretary for her remark wish to begin by pay tribute to the exceptional man and woman who serve in our intelligence and security service in government and in our police as they all work tirelessly to keep our country safe two day on from the anniversary of also wish to remember the life lose and all those affect by the tragic event of and to reaffirm labour commitment to stand against the evil of terrorism as the home secretary have lay out the terrorism act proscribed organisations amendment order amend the list of proscribe organisation in schedule to the act by add wagner group as new entry what the government be propose today will make it criminal offence to belong to wagner group to engage in activity such as attend meeting to promote support for the group or to publicly display their logo put the group on par with organisation such as the islamic state and al qaeda it also enable wagner asset to be categorise as terrorist property and seize it be motion that we on these opposition benches strongly support proscribing wagner group be necessary step to address the threat that they pose it be an action for which we on the labour benches have be call for some time the shadow home secretary call for this back in february the united states designate wagner transnational criminal organisation nine month ago france designate wagner as terrorist entity back in may although be very conscious of the complexity around this type of proscription perhaps the june coup be far complicate factor will the home secretary reflect on whether lesson could be learn with regard to act soon this go back to the point make by the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran moment ago ask that question mindful of the long stand support for proscription from members right across this house include the former chair of the foreign affairs committee the shadow home secretary have consistently raise the challenge involve in use counter terror legislation to proscribe state sponsor organisation such as wagner we have long call for the introduction of bespoke proscribing mechanism design specifically to address state sponsor threat the government contest update publish in july state the most pressing national security priority be now the threat from russia to european security yet the strategy do not set out comprehensive response to the national security threat pose by state and state sponsor actor would therefore be grateful if the home secretary outline what robust action the government be take to tackle those threat there be many people and organisation in the world that we could call force for good wagner be at the opposite end of that spectrum they be force for evil wherever they be their track record be one of violence theft and murder from ukraine to syria and from mali to mozambique they help to spearhead the takeover of crimea in and have carry out appal war crime since the invasion of ukraine they have be implicate in massacre of civilian and increase abuse by security force in multiple other country in place such as the central african republic they have offer business model essentially trade violence for natural resource turbocharge the abusive extraction of mineral that have drive so much conflict and corruption in weak state around the world as of july the government have sanction few than quarter of the individual and entity the foreign affairs committee recently identify as be link to wagner ask the home secretary to give an assurance that the government be look closely at those individual and work to ensure that where possible sanction be apply as the committee also point out in its excellent report wagner be sprawl decentralise network of individual and commercial entity for which the membership be not always clear the presume assassination of wagner leader yevgeny prigozhin may hasten the break up of the organisation but there be little doubt that their work could continue under different name by the same or different individual will the home secretary confirm that work with her colleague across government step be be take to ensure that the uk be ready to respond to such scenario of course the threat pose by wagner be multiply exponentially because of their link to the kremlin it fit neatly within pattern of crime corruption and kleptocracy that pose much wide danger russian information and election subversion operation which wagner support and which have target the uk among other country will not go away not least because other country be imitate they but by proscribe the group we demonstrate an important commitment towards protect our democratic value completely understand that the home secretary will be limit in what she can say but give the activity of wagner it would be helpful be she able to say something about the progress that the defend democracy taskforce be make we also need to consider way in which the uk may itself be facilitate the profit of wagner backer and those like they for example research by transparency international uk suggest that since billion worth of uk property be buy by russians accuse of corruption or with link to the kremlin more than half of that be hold through company in britain overseas territory and crown dependency more than company register in those area be use in russian money laundering and corruption case involve more than billion of illicit fund what be the betting that some of those beneficiary be link to wagner what be the harm to our security be do even by those who be not know that the home secretary will not consider this proscription as job do and will see it as just an important further step towards disrupt and defeat wagner murderous terrorist activity while be conscious that she will be limit in what she be able to say would be grateful if she could say something about what step the government be take to strengthen financial transparency and accountability in the uk in our dependency and overseas the labour party strongly support the motion we will work constructively to stand against the evil of terrorism and look forward to hear from the home secretary on the question that have put to she completely support my right hon and learn friend the home secretary in proscribe wagner group as she say they be instrumental in russia brutal and illegal invasion of ukraine they be almost certainly complicit in war crime of the sort that we have see describe throughout this horrific conflict and it be right that we support our ally in ukraine in particular president zelensky my purpose in rise in this debate be to question the logic of proscribe wagner group today and the government sense of priority in that we be not do so alongside if not link to the islamic revolutionary guard corps in iran do so by reference to the test set out for the proscription of wagner group in the government explanatory note to this motion the first test be the nature and scale of the organisation activity my right hon and learn friend the home secretary have set out how wagner meet that test but the irgc be answerable directly to the supreme leader in iran so it have direct link with the iranian state malignant activity include its support of the war in ukraine the irgc be directly involve in the brutal oppression of the iranian people the suppression of human right the disappearance the torture and the execution so why not proscribe it the second test set out by the government for proscribe an organisation be the specific threat that it pose to the uk hope my right hon and learn friend may say little bit more as far as she be able about that specific threat but it be clear in the case of the irgc that have acknowledge the real threat from iran aggressive intelligence service towards the united kingdom the irgc clearly pass that test the third test for an organisation be the specific threat that it pose to british national overseas give the scale of the activity that wagner group be involve in they would clearly pass that test however the irgc be an indispensable part of the chain of hostage taking that have direct impact on the safety of uk national and particularly uk dual national abroad include in iran why be we not see that linkage here the fourth test be the extent of the organisation presence in the uk be not quite clear about the extent of wagner presence in the uk can understand its impact on the uk but do not quite grasp its presence in the uk however be very clear about iran presence here and the irgc role in use its propaganda base to incite extremism in the uk the fifth test be the need to support international partner in the fight against terrorism my right hon and learn friend have quite rightly set out number of country that be our partner in the international community and should be get our support in the fight against wagner group and their interest in their own country however we know that the irgc be the export bureau for terrorism in the region to its neighbour and beyond we have have so many example from hezbollah onwards then we come to the linkage the irgc in iran have huge control over the mean of production in that country it be inconceivable that it be not intricately involve in the production of the drone that iran send to russia for the oppression of the ukrainian people if war crime have be carry out by russia the mean of carry out those crime have at least part of its origin in tehran with the irgc it be essential that we tackle that as quickly as we can no one will disagree that wagner be an evil dangerous and malign grouping but would argue that they be no bad than the irgc which be not be proscribe by the government indeed the prime minister in seek the leadership of the conservative party be very supportive of the concept of proscribe the irgc so why this inactivity understand that my right hon and learn friend the home secretary will have to have discussion and there will be strong input from the foreign office in this she have be tough and robust home secretary something that many of we greatly appreciate but we be well behind the curve compare with the united states when it come to the irgc and our failure to tackle what be malign influence in the world today be damage britain reputation in the world beyond ask my right hon and learn friend to consult urgently with the rest of government to see whether we should not be come back to this chamber as quickly as possible and add the irgc to the group that this country will rightly proscribe because of their impact on this country our citizen the safety of country beyond our ally and international law itself call the snp spokesperson be glad to follow the right hon member for north somerset dr fox and agree entirely with what he say many people in this house have for some time be call for the proscription of the irgc have constituent who be also concerned about the reach of the irgc and be scared for their own safety even in this country it would be useful if the home secretary address the delay in the proscription in she sum up wagner group be an appalling organisation the strength of the atrocity that that murderous organisation have be carry out have be well document and well know for year at the high level of the british government the explanatory memorandum to the order set out clearly the group activity as proxy military force on behalf of the russian state it state found in wagner group have operate in range of theatre include ukraine syria the central african republic sudan libya mozambique and mali in pursuit of russia foreign policy objective and the objective of host government who have contract wagner service so why have it take until hot war on european soil and co ordinate plane crash kill the group leader for this order to come before the house that be quite astonishing catalogue of chaos and destruction have come before today and as much as we support the measure it feel to and many other that the government have take far too long to raise the designation we in the snp be disgusted that in october before putin invasion the treasury then under the control of the now prime minister allow yevgeny prigozhin to circumvent sanction and launch target attack on british journalist we very much want to see action against wagner group and all those associate with they that be significant point in the press release accompany this announcement the minister for security the right hon member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat say proscribing wagner send clear message that the uk will not tolerate russia proxy and their barbaric action in ukraine and condemn wagner campaign of corruption and bloodshed on the african continent which have be repeatedly link to human right violation that be all fine and well but why be this not do soon would like answer from the home secretary on that act soon may have stem some of that bloodshed and some of what have happen and may have send clear message more widely at much early stage if the organisation be indeed found in that mean that we have now be wait nine year for this measure and lot of destruction have pass since designating wagner group for proscription be response to repeat request from ukraine president zelensky who have call for the group to be treat as terrorist organisation can the home secretary tell we when he first make that request of the government and what response have be give to he clearly we support president zelensky and want he to succeed in his endeavour but it would be useful to know the timeline and when the government respond to that request on the wide situation organisation that work for wagner group depend on the flow of fund that often wash up through bank account in the united kingdom we know about the uk reputation as hub for launder dirty money prior to this debate the house deal with the economic crime and corporate transparency bill which could do more still to ensure that we know who own and benefit from various type of financial structure be the home secretary satisfy that that legislation will go far enough to prevent the son daughter relative and associate of wagner group member from move money through account here in the uk we should do everything we can in light of prigozhin action to evade uk sanction to shut down wagner group wherever they might sprout up the foreign affairs committee have brand the uk government effort to deter wagner group underwhelme in the extreme and recommend that the conservative party revive at the early opportunity the manifesto commitment to spend of the uk gross national income on official development assistance russia and china to an extent be exploit and seek to put their influence into the gap leave by uk development assistance as we pull back from that influence that we have have in the world we do not want country to be turn to state such as russia and to group such as wagner that work on their behalf will the home secretary comment on what more can be do to ensure that we counter such nefarious influence once state go down that road it can be very difficult to come back and we know from country in africa that the result of that will also end up on the home secretary desk in the form of people seek asylum in this country flee from war that we could have do more to prevent have we clamp down and have we provide aid at different stage all of this be interconnect and all of it come through her department the foreign affairs committee have also comment that it have receive no evidence of any serious effort by the uk government to track wagner network activity in country other than ukraine that be perhaps not directly within the home secretary remit but could she comment wee bit far on the tracking of the wagner group activity on how closely the uk state be monitor those activity to ensure we understand where they be now and crucially where they might be go next they appear to have very nimble organisation that can change and evolve so we need to be mindful that although prigozhin be go there be plenty of people to replace he within that organisation what they be do be clearly lucrative so we need to have that intelligence and analysis of their network to make sure we be keep close eye on what happen next and what more the uk state can do to intervene in it can the home secretary talk bit more about the further sanction on civilian enabler and frontman which touch on little when we be debate the economic crime and corporate transparency bill there be people in this country be certain who be facilitate lot of the movement of finance we have the opportunity to go far than be propose in the order to look at those frontman and those who give the organisation its corporate face will the uk government have regular mechanism for co ordinating with ally about sanction prioritise travel ban for example to make sure that those actor involve in wagner do not get to move around be the magnitsky sanction list also co ordinate with today action and will more sanction on that list follow know that it be not the do thing to say who be go to be sanction but it would be good to get some reassurance that that list be continually under review finally it would also be useful to know what further mechanism there be for oversight in this house we need to be keep close eye on this issue it should not have take nine year to get to where we be today what more will be do to make sure that this be an effective mechanism that we be keep very close eye on this organisation and its operative and do everything we can as good ally to ukraine to make sure that all our action be co ordinated work with other ally to make sure everything that can possibly be do to shut down this evil terrorist organisation be do and do quickly call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you mr deputy speaker naturally and the liberal democrats welcome the government decision to proscribe wagner mercenary group as terrorist organisation but hope the home secretary hear some of the frustration about how long it have take when president zelensky first address the house of commons on march just day after russia invasion be sure many member be there it be profoundly move his ask of we be that we recognise russia as terrorist state the next day our party agree with he publicly and furthermore say that we must proscribe wagner group it have be day since the illegal and unprovoked invasion of ukraine and the government only decide last week to finally get their act together be sorry but that be far far too late the proscription come after the organisation infamous leader have his plane mysteriously blow out of the sky and wagner group power be now wan this be classic case of close the stable door after the horse have bolt yes wagner group be weak now but what could we have prevent what could we have stop they from do have we start this process early this barbarous group have always be terrorist they be terrorist year ago and they be terrorist nine year ago we do not need more information we just need to get on with it as have be describe wagner group have be wreak havoc and destruction not just in ukraine but all over in syria mali the central african republic sudan and libya the government have repeatedly inform the house of what step they be take to provide support to ukrainians fight russian force and wagner group but ask the government to update we on what support we be provide our partner in africa face these same bloodthirsty mercenary we have take too long in weaken they and we have allow they to take root we understand that russia be now fall in behind and try to recoup some of these contract but be afraid to say that it should not have get to this point on sanction which be mention by the home secretary my colleague in the house of lords have recently raise the issue of joint venture that operate between the united arab emirates russia wagner group and country such as sudan join my colleague in the lords in hop that the government might update money launder regulation with haste to ensure that these loophole be closed because we know these loophole exist would like to remind the house of debate we have in january when we debate the opendemocracy report that expose how the government assist assist yevgeny prigozhin in evade sanction to launch legal attack on british journalist special licence issue in by the then chancellor of the exchequer now the prime minister enable this move despite sanction that have be impose in to prevent such dealing with prigozhin as say at the time that one of the most notorious criminal in the world and now uk proscribe terrorist albeit dead might have evade sanction to sue british journalist should not have happen and we still need answer about what happen the other thing that remain an unanswered question again this be link be the issue of golden visa which lie squarely in the department of the home secretary yes the government cease the use of tier investment visa but time and again they have refuse to publish the full review after five year they release short statement about the review but never the review itself be sorry to say that this just create suspicion this house need to know to what extent the government let kremlin link oligarch treat this country as their playground and if it be too sensitive for we to see here and accept it might well be release it to the intelligence and security committee for example let it have the transparency it need because if the government have nothing to hide then they have nothing to fear finally be glad that the government have finally see the error of their way regard the timeline to proscribe wagner but they now must learn this lesson and not wait in particular they must not make the same mistake with iran and echo the point make by member early the home secretary will know that september mark the one year anniversary of the killing of mahsa amini in iran and time and again across this house we have repeatedly call for the proscription of the islamic revolutionary guard corps in iran the home secretary have warm up her proscription muscle and would urge she to use they again perhaps even this week to mark that tragic anniversary be grateful to all who have contribute to this debate many important issue have be raise and be encourage by the supportive atmosphere in which the discussion have take place we all agree that wagner group be terrorist plain and simple and be confident that this house recognise as the british people recognise that we have moral responsibility to act we must and we will confront terrorism wherever and however it occur and that be why we be take this action hon member have all make very powerful point and let attempt to take they in some kind of logical order the shadow minister the hon member for barnsley central dan jarvis raise the issue of comparison with other international ally gently say that we have be work intensively to build international consensus but also to work closely in cohesive way with our ally the us designation to which the hon gentleman refer be equivalent to the sanction that the uk impose in march last year it be not equivalent to our proscription power that we be take right now the french parliament support non bind resolution to call wagner terrorist but it have not formally proscribe that be why emphasise that we be take leadership role in formally proscribe wagner as terrorist organisation will continue to work with international partner to create broad consensus agree with everything that the home secretary have say we be take lead and that be brilliant have she have specific conversation on this matter with her counterpart and also with the eu the eu can also proscribe and designate wagner as terrorist organisation which itself have financial implication will she bring that up with the european union too the threat pose by terrorist organisation include wagner group have be on the agenda in many of my dialogue with international partner because of its wholesale destructive nature and the enormity of the threat that it pose the shadow minister also ask about our broad strategy on russia and our approach to state threat what turn to first be our integrated review which set out in the most pressing term that the most urgent national security and foreign policy priority in the short to medium term be to address the threat pose by russia to european security we will continue to work with our ally and partner to defend the rule base international order and we stand united in condemn russia reprehensible action which be an egregious violation of international law and the un charter when the integrated review be publish it make clear that we be deal head on with the threat pose by russia we take it extremely seriously and we have respond to it we have call out russian aggression wherever it occur the national security act landmark piece of legislation that overhaul our outdated espionage rule already create wide range of new offence tool and power to counter state threat and their activity in many respect those cover similar ground to proscription like power of the kind that the shadow minister be refer to but the act will give we and importantly equip our agency with wide range tool to specify foreign power or part of foreign power or an entity control by foreign power under the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme for example it will mean that person in those arrangement will have to register their activity or risk prosecution that be groundbreaking tool that we will be equip with thank to the passage of that landmark legislation the defend democracy taskforce to which the shadow minister refer be lead cross government work it be chair and lead by the minister for security my right hon friend the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat but that cross government work be take place to drive forward the taskforce priority with parliament our security and intelligence community the devolve administrations local authority the private sector and civil society it have be incredibly extensive in its coverage so far and we look forward to its have tangible impact on those agency to which refer several members ask about sanction and in particular the sanction in place against wagner group in the uk designate prigozhin through the libya sanction regime that be for his and wagner group involvement in activity that threaten the peace stability and security of libya include defy the un arm embargo in march the uk also designate the wagner group for their role in action that destabilise ukraine asset freeze be impose on fund identify as belong to the wagner group in the uk as well as travel ban on any of their member in july this year the foreign secretary announce new uk sanction target range of individual and business link to the action of the wagner group in africa that include individual from the wagner group associate with execution and torture in mali and the central african republic and threat to peace and security in sudan those sanction have have an impact they constrain the ability to utilise asset and limit the ability to travel as say the framework have constrain the freedom and ability of these organisation and individual of course the broad range set of sanction have be one of the large set of sanction impose on modern economy several hon member ask what more the government be do to monitor the risk that the wagner group and other russian private military company or mercenary fragment and reform in different mould our approach to tackle wagner and other russian pmc have three core strand military sanction and state building the extensive military support we have give to ukraine seek to counter the threat that wagner pose there and our sanction constrain their ability to utilise asset and to travel our diplomatic engagement with partner around the world focus on support fragile state to build their own capacity and discourage wagner from take root several hon member reference how wagner trade in violence and benefit through government para government or paramilitary group plunder resource asset and other form of wealth in those nation if those state be robust and resilient in the first place group such as wagner will not be able to take root that work relate to private military company be extensive and our cross government russia unit bring our full range of capability to bear against the malign influence of these contractor in concert with our ally several hon member reference africa for many year wagner have have destabilising effect on the african continent they have be reportedly responsible for multiple breach of international humanitarian law and abuse of human right include numerous report of indiscriminate killing of unarmed civilian summary execution and rape we have again seek to take leading role in reduce opportunity for wagner to operate in africa and hold they to account for the atrocity they commit lastly several hon member notably my right hon friend the member for north somerset dr fox reference the irgc it be clear that iran continue to pose persistent threat to uk base individual which be unacceptable there have obviously be significant parliamentary medium and public interest in potential proscription decision on the irgc both the house of commons and the house of lords have discuss irgc proscription with the house of commons unanimously pass motion in january to urge the government to proscribe it it be clear that the iranian regime continue to occupy serious and worrying role in our global order we continue to condemn iran role as one of the top military backer of russia invasion of ukraine since august last year tehran have transfer hundred of unmanned aerial vehicle to moscow in violation of un security council resolution we work tirelessly with our international partner to hold iran to account for the sale of drone to russia and we have impose three round of sanction on iranian individual and entity

germany and the us and we support ukraine request for un investigation it be clear that iran continue to pose persistent threat to uk base individual which be unacceptable the department keep the list

detail on this issue have hear the comment of member here and the sentiment of the house minister previously confirm to this house that the decision be under active consideration but that we would not provide run commentary know that will disappoint member but we be cognisant and open eyed about the threat that the irgc pose to the uk be very grateful for this house support for the decision to proscribe the wagner group as terrorist organisation the brutality and the enormity of destruction and devastation wreak by this group be unspeakable it be right that we act now commend this order to the house question put and agree to resolve that the draft terrorism act proscribed organisations amendment order which be lay before this house on september be approve on point of order mr deputy

be find for some development will be reduction in section agreement for affordable housing hundred of job in my constituency be at risk the government find solution and we have now find out that the opposition plan to block it after previously signal agreement wonder if minister might signal their intention to come to the house to set out the impact that the flip flopping of his majesty opposition might have on constituency such as workington the hon gentleman have place his view on the record and it have be hear by ministers he will understand it be not matter for the chair but be quite sure that member on both front benches will have hear what he have have to say and will treat the matter with the respect that it deserve petition year of notting hill and ealing high school rise to present petition sign by people from ealing acton and chiswick all part of my constituency fittingly they be all woman because it regard notting hill and ealing high school an all girl school

allow individual to express themselves the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to celebrate the achievement of notting hill and ealing high school and to recognise the historic and important role it have play in support girl education and the petitioner remain etc residential co operative power production motion make and question propose that this house do now wood be grateful to have secure this debate to champion reform that be not only innovative but pragmatic an idea that encapsulate the essence of empowerment economic prudence and the responsible stewardship of our environment at the heart of this vision be the unequivocal call to reconsider our approach to fund residential co operative power production in particular by not impose green levy on individual who choose to invest in their own renewable no matter where in the country they may be it be not just about fiscal prudence but about put the power to shape our green energy future back into the hand of the people we live in time where large scale wind and solar energy have emerge as the united kingdom most viable source of renewable electricity yet what truly set this era apart be the exciting realisation that ordinary people like you mr deputy speaker and can now own share of wind farm or solar park this be not merely financial transaction it be an opportunity for each of we to become an active participant in shape the trajectory of the uk energy landscape vision reminiscent of the transformative privatisation of the by the revolutionary thatcher government consumer ownership of green energy asset go beyond mere financial gain it empower individual to play pivotal role in the transition to net zero emission it make tangible and accessible our personal contribution to and the benefit from that shift so how do it work the process be simple as individual we can purchase share in renewable power production initiative alongside thousand of other we receive our share of the electricity generate deliver directly to our home via the national grid we experience tangible saving on our electricity bill each month for the entire lifespan of the asset grow number of consumer both household and business have take the bold step to invest in their own off site green energy generation they be not just secure energy independence for themselves they be contribute significantly to the uk environmental target these consumer invest by purchase share in residential co operative power production initiative bear their portion of upfront construction cost owner of these share receive their share of the electricity generate deliver to they via the grid importantly their energy supplier purchase this electricity at the low operating cost of the co operative rather than at the fluctuating wholesale market price the result saving be then apply directly to the owner bill each month stabilise cost over the long term however glaring issue demand our immediate attention consumer who invest in their own renewable power production have energy levy integrate directly into their electricity bill by virtue of the fact that they be purchase from the grid contract for difference feed in tariff green levy and so on all come off their bill paradoxically the levy mean that consumer who own their own green energy asset effectively subsidise the green power consumption of other the energy levy serve as significant deterrent to investment in consumer own residential co operative power they hinder people from directly reap the reward of the uk transition to net zero counterintuitive outcome to say the least my proposal be simple yet powerful consumer who own share in off site renewable power production should be grant an exemption from the levy such step could potentially reduce their bill by remarkable that would create compelling incentive for consumer to invest in their own source of green power unlock new wave of personal private ownership of uk infrastructure moreover there be another aspect that warrant attention portion of the saving that consumer accumulate on their electricity bill be currently liable to taxation the saving be treat as interest and if they surpass their owner annual interest allowance they become subject to taxation the taxation of these saving serve as significant deterrent to invest in energy ownership as it add complexity and uncertainty to the financial picture in develop sustainable future tax consumer bill saving from off site renewable energy ownership be also counterproductive propose that we rectify it by exempt all bill saving from off site green energy production from taxation that would bring this into line with the treatment of home solar create level playing field for all renewable energy investment member may be wonder about the potential cost impact so let be clear if these energy levy and tax exemption do not induce people to invest in their own energy asset there would be no cost at all to the treasury or to other consumer the scale of the cost impact hinge directly on the scale of the adoption of green energy ownership within the residential co operative if people do not invest there will be no cost to put that into perspective if just of consumer decide to invest in such manner the levy impose on other consumer would increase by approximately year these cost would be defer and the treasury revenue would be neutral for probably the next five or six quarter to underscore the real world impact of this proposal let share with the house compelling case study it concern wind farm launch by ripple energy not far from cardiff and near my constituency of bridgend in porthcawl it be one of the first consumer own wind farm own collectively by individual from across the country who invest an average of each it have be generate clean electricity since march and have save its owner an average of on their electricity bill with project saving of about in its second year these substantial saving be attributable to the recent surge in electricity price importantly ownership of the wind farm have shield those individual from the price spike that have burden other consumer in recent time if we look beyond the immediate financial and logistical benefit we see that this proposal carry even more profound significance in the context of our nation future it position we on path to energy independence and resilience against global energy price shock vulnerability expose by international conflict and war such as what we be currently witness in ukraine in post brexit britain this initiative be emblematic of the british public take back control take control of their energy future take control of their financial wellbeing and take control of our contribution to greener more sustainable world it encapsulate the very essence of british self reliance and national pride align perfectly with the spirit of autonomy that brexit have come to symbolise beyond the immediate fiscal and environmental benefit this proposal have the power to shape our society it can foster sense of collective purpose and unity as people from all walk of life come together to invest in our common future imagine community rally around the prospect of own share of local wind farm or solar park imagine school and university engage student in the process of renewable energy ownership educate they about the importance of sustainability and self reliance picture future when our energy landscape be dominate not solely by faceless corporation but by the collective will of the people tapestry of interconnect community own energy asset that serve as symbol of resilience and sustainability furthermore in line with the government commitment to grow the economy this initiative can act as catalyst for innovation and job creation as more and more consumer invest in green energy ownership the demand for renewable energy technology will soar this will spur research and development in the uk renewable sector create new opportunity for scientist engineer and entrepreneur simultaneously the growth of the consumer own green energy sector will lead to the establishment of local energy co operative and business generate employment and economic growth in region across the uk in world where the challenge of climate change loom large where global energy price be subject to geopolitical disruption and where the public desire for self determination have never be more pronounced this proposal be testament to our ability to take control of our life it be resounding declaration that we the people of the united kingdom be not mere spectator in the unfold drama of our energy future we be its author and its protagonist in conclusion what we have before we be not merely fiscal proposal but transformative vision one that empower individual safeguard our energy future and solidify our commitment to sustainable tomorrow by not tax green levy on those individual who choose to invest in their own renewable we would be give power back to the people and ensure that everyone could partake in our collective journey toward more sustainable fair and more resilient tomorrow congratulate my hon friend the member for bridgend dr wallis on secure this important debate and thank he for share his thought during the conversation that we be able to have ahead of it as we hear in his moving and well think out speech he have continue to be champion in this regard want to begin by assure he that the government recognise the importance of empower local community to come together to deliver renewable energy project for their area be that put solar panel on school roof set up electric vehicle charger in local community or develop residential power production use hydro say to power village my hon friend have raise concern that people who invest in their own renewable energy be still require to pay the green levy that be part of their energy bill and he make an appeal that they should cease to do so levy more than pay for themselves by drive investment in renewable he mention the fact that large scale renewable have drive down cost enormously over the last decade or so not least through our contract for difference scheme which this government be very proud of these levy provide vital support to low income and vulnerable household and because of the way they have be use in the system they have save consumer money on their energy bill overall over the past year have fair system rely on everyone be part of it if consumer anywhere be reliant on the infrastructure that be develop by the whole there be strong case that they should contribute to that whole otherwise there be danger of create system that be the opposite of what my hon friend seek namely system that be less fair in which people can buy their way out of system that be design to cater for all the government be commit to ensure that the cost of the uk transition to net zero be fair and affordable for all energy consumer and over the past decade environmental and social scheme have be instrumental in drive the decarbonisation of the system it be fair that all consumer should contribute towards the cost of these scheme as the uk transition to abundant low carbon energy over the come decade will bring benefit to household and business everywhere our recent exposure to volatile global gas price underscore the importance of our plan to build strong home grow renewable energy sector in order far to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel but one that importantly ensure that everyone everywhere whether or not they can invest in their own local renewable energy be protect and look after some billpayer fund scheme be important for tackle fuel poverty by provide financial support or home upgrade to low income and vulnerable household we do not wish to see system in which people can withdraw from support that ofgem the energy regulator in great britain administer renewable energy and social scheme on behalf of the government and ensure that policy target be meet in as economical and consumer friendly way as possible list of the current environmental and social scheme that be fund through those bill can be find on ofgem website in response to my hon friend point about change the tax rule specifically on bill saving from off site renewable ownership he will know what be come have no choice but to comment that taxation be matter not for but for the chancellor however would like to reassure he that we see value in and support community energy include co operative that come together to create community energy project such as graig fatha which he mention they play role in our effort to eliminate our contribution to climate change the government offer range of support to that type of project perhaps just slightly different in nature to the one that he have so passionately espouse today they include the brilliant new million community energy fund this enable both rural and urban community across england to access grant funding to develop local renewable energy project for investment the community energy fund follow on from the success of the rural community energy fund which be deliver through our local net zero hub and have fund several innovative project an example be swaffham prior in east cambridgeshire pioneer project in village of around home it be one of the first village in the uk to install heating network into the exist infrastructure in order to get more brilliant project such as swaffham prior set up we be aim to launch application to the community energy fund as soon as possible recognise that the community energy fund be open only to community in england this be because the devolve nation have their own support scheme for community energy for instance the welsh government have the energy service which work with both the public sector and community enterprise to reduce energy use to generate locally own renewable energy and to reduce carbon emission similarly the scottish government community and renewable energy scheme support community across scotland to engage with participate in and benefit from the energy transition to net zero community energy funding be available alongside uk wide growth funding and we encourage community energy group and residential co operative to work closely with their local authority to support the development of community energy project within these scheme the uk share prosperity fund support intervention that reinforce our commitment to reach net zero and that include billion of funding for investment in place include for community infrastructure project an example of that be west devon district council which have be among the local area to benefit from this type of uk growth funding it receive million under the share prosperity fund which include provision to support community energy group help they to bring project forward and to access fund to support their goal entirely share the vision and the aspiration set out by my hon friend and we have measure in place to ensure that can be bring to reality beyond this ofgem also support community energy project and be now welcome application from community interest group co operative society and community benefit society to the industry voluntary redress scheme which be much more helpful than its name suggest this allow group to apply for fund to deliver energy relate project that support energy consumer in vulnerable situation that support decarbonisation and that benefit people in england scotland and wales we also regularly engage with the community energy sector through the community energy contact group this be our central engagement method to stay in touch with community energy to hear from the voice of that community and to allow the people involve to feed into government policy know many member include my hon friend will have support the local electricity bill and the amendment on community energy that be table on the energy bill during the passage of the energy bill which be delighted to say have now complete its commons stage the government carefully consider the amendment that seek to ensure right to local supply we set out the reason why we be unable to accept those amendment and why it be not right to do so which include ensure the good outcome for consumer and the sector overall but the government recognise that community energy project have real benefit for the community in which they be base and for the nation as whole and we be keen to ensure that they deliver value for money for consumer nationally and locally alike we have work closely with many parliamentarian and the community energy sector to develop commitment that will well support the development of this type of energy these commitment include the launch of the million community energy fund which have already mention alongside which we have commit to publish an annual report and to consult on the barrier that the sector face when develop project precisely to ensure that we can have more of they we be work with the sector through the community energy contact group so that we have the most effective route available and so that we make it as easy for community to understand the help that be available in the system close by thank my hon friend for secure this important debate and for the manner in which he open it be proud of the wide range of support that the government offer to community energy group across the country this support enable local community group to come together to deliver renewable energy project for their area include in residential co operative share the vision that my hon friend set out and look forward to work closely with he in wales scotland england and right across the united kingdom to see that vision make even more of reality than it be today question put and agree to house adjourn deferred division exit the european union that the draft windsor framework enforcement etc regulation which be lay before this house on september be approve debbie abrahams bim afolami nickie
