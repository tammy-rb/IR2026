devon be be hit not only by labour job tax but by the increase minimum wage rise cost and other business tax increase each of those alone would force many to reduce their workforce but the combination of all three mean that business be think twice about fill job vacancy or create new post what reassurance can the minister give to business across wales and to company such as serpells in my constituency that their business have promising future between now and the next election when the labour budget show they the complete opposite if the conservative party care so much about employment and business in wales perhaps the hon lady should explain why her colleague in the senedd vote last week to block thousand of new apprenticeship and more than million of support for business in wales her party vote against that let we go to the shadow front bench call the shadow secretary of state for wales who be the secretary of state battle for kazakhstan or wales labour political choice mean countless job in wales be at risk due to the national insurance rise the damaging impact that be have in the minister back yard be clear with more than job reportedly at risk at cardiff university in one of the many sector that be desperately try to stay afloat due to the welsh government job tax and the labour government impact on the welsh economy with cardiff university plough on with its kazakhstan campus can the right hon lady be happy with the offshoring of those role in that sector and many other because of the continue fallout from the autumn budget be not sure where the hon member have get the idea about outsource job it be her party that tell our university across the country to go out and recruit international student which they do now because of that and because of what happen under her government watch those international student be not come any more she should again look to her colleague in the senedd there be the education budget her party vote against it she need to talk to her colleague in the senedd call the liberal democrat spokesperson the national insurance increase be set to hit high street in wales hard with many trader say that they will lay off staff as result last week the government announce million of funding to be spend on reinvigorate welsh high street but no town in the swansea neath or amman valley be on that list will the secretary of state clarify the criterion use to select the successful town and whether area such as ystalyfera can expect to benefit from future funding that be one high street that be certainly worth invest in the criterion for the announcement last week be publicly available suggest the hon gentleman have look at it diolch yn fawr iawn lefarydd be sure the house will join in remember the llandow air disaster in which people lose their life year ago elaine hair and beauty salon in llanrug pitian patian nursery in llanwnda and care home and gp surgery across dwyfor meirionnydd tell that national

have have to take difficult decision her constituent will want more investment in our nhs more investment in our public service and more investment to support business her party vote against all that in the welsh budget if the government agree with the secretary of state counterpart in cardiff we would have the money from the crown estate as well back in the secretary of state and walk through the same lobby to vote against what she then describe as despicable tory welfare cut and she dare the break the labour whip to do so give the evidence of her strong conviction on the issue how can she justify remain in cabinet that be intent on implement tory style welfare cut we inherit tory welfare system that be the bad of all world it have the wrong incentive it discourage people from work the people who really need safety net be still not get the dignity and support that they need and the taxpayer be fund an ever spiral bill it be unsustainable indefensible and unfair our principle for reform be clear support those who need support restore trust and fairness in the system fix that break assessment process and the disincentive and support people to start stay and success in work the right hon lady should support that crown estate devolution what recent discussion she have have with the welsh government on devolve the crown estate recently meet the deputy first minister to discuss wide range of issue include the crown estate the uk and welsh governments be focus on take maximum advantage of the opportunity that float offshore wind in the celtic sea present for wales which could create over job and billion of investment to the uk economy in the come year in the scottish national party manifesto we commit to have the equivalent of of scotland electricity generate from renewable the snp meet that target and then some thank to the devolution of the crown estate and to work with industry it be now deliver job and clean green energy to scotland and throughout the uk why should wales not have the same opportunity will not take any lecture on the crown estate from the hon member whose party mismanagement of the scottish seabed result in scottish asset be sell off on the cheap we be focus on do whatever it take to secure more than job in wales and the billion of pound of investment that the crown estate can unlock for wales do the secretary of state agree that the government priority should be ensure that the crown estate can unlock thousand of new well pay job in wales that will come with float offshore wind rather than be distract by call to devolve the organisation in the middle of this national mission which would risk the investment job and low energy bill that wales desperately need my hon friend be absolutely right like she want people in wales to benefit from those new job particularly young people so that they do not have to leave wales where they have grow up to earn or learn want that billion boost to the economy we be not prepared to put all that at risk of market fragmentation undermine or potentially destroy developer confidence in flow and have to watch that investment go elsewhere in the world change to apr and bpr number of farms affect what estimate she have make with cabinet colleague of the number of farm affect by change to agricultural property relief and business property relief in wales what estimate she have make with cabinet colleague of the number of farm affect by change to agricultural property relief and business property relief in wales have speak to the farming union in wales and understand their strength of feeling these change be expect to affect around claim across the whole uk with very few in wales meanwhile most importantly the welsh government and this government have protect the farming budget at its current level while the welsh conservatives try to block that money from reach farmer by vote against the welsh government budget last week the scotland office be conduct series of agricultural roundtable talk directly to farmer and put together statistic to push back against the orthodoxy that only tiny number of very wealthy estate will be affect which be simply not the case this increasingly look like war on farmer by the treasury what part be the minister play in fight back against it the treasury be confident in its figure specific question on the methodology be matter for the treasury but repeat that the change to apr be expect to affect only claim across the whole uk with very few in wales as the hon member know we be committed to our farmer through keep the million block grant which the welsh government have pass on to farmer directly farmer across the uk have already be rock by the change to apr and bpr and yesterday we have shock news that the department for environment food and rural affairs will take no new sustainable farming incentive application in england what reassurance can the minister give farmer in wales that the sustainable farming scheme will be deliver in full and on time on january next year as the hon gentleman know my good friend the deputy first minister of wales have spend lot of time talk to farmer we have absolutely protect the budget for farmer as have the welsh government so the full million will go directly to farmer despite his colleague in the senedd try to block it last week call the chair of the welsh affairs committee the welsh affairs committee be launch its inquiry into farming in wales this week because we know that farming be cornerstone of the welsh economy the welsh government budget contain over million to support welsh farmer do the minister agree that it be shame that the opposition party be play fast and loose with farmer livelihood by vote against the welsh government budget last week indeed my hon friend be absolutely right it be an utter disgrace that opposition party decide to vote against the budget last week they be effectively try to block money go to farmer what disgrace call the shadow secretary of state the government have say that they be concern as we all be about our future security so why be food security expendable in wales and beyond that be the message from farmer stella owen of the national farmers union cymru who have say that the government action be destructive and threaten the future of family farm across wales how many of those family farm be the minister prepare to see go under before she and the secretary of state step up and act in the interest of that key sector by help the man and woman who be livid worried and fear for their livelihood as be sure the shadow secretary of state have be remind many time difficult decision have to be make to fund our public service but the change still leave significant amount of relief in place farming parent will typically be able to pass on up to million to their child without pay any inheritance tax at all and above that amount inheritance tax will be pay at reduce effective rate of up to rather than the standard estate have up to year to pay any tax due and it will be interest free those term be not available to other that fair and balanced approach maintain support for family farm while also fix the public service on which we include farmer rely cancer strategies whether she have have recent discussion with the welsh government on the implementation of cancer strategy have regular discussion with my welsh government colleague about health be pleased to see clear progress in cancer service in wales in december performance against the day cancer target be the good we have

england and wales since august not single health board in wales have meet its cancer target leave patient waiting month for their referral to start treatment and despite recommendation to implement screening programme properly the standard for uptake be not be achieve lead to poor health outcome as the department of health and social care embark on develop strategy for england how will the

be also set up national cancer leadership board to improve cancer care thank to those investment welsh nhs service be improve include for cancer and waiting list be fall will my hon friend outline how she be work in partnership with the welsh government to improve cancer and health outcome could she try to help understand why on earth in the welsh budget vote last week the conservatives and plaid

deliver specific package on cancer care the initial phase which be go to focus on breast skin gynaecological low gastrointestinal and neurological cancer will improve productivity and efficiency in how health board deliver care this include send people straight to test without an out patient appointment alongside this the welsh government be implement wide range of service improvement from

million investment for venue cymru in llandudno and the newport transporter bridge these be two key project that will help to boost the tourism and culture sector in wales the tourism and hospitality sector in the uk be one of the most heavily tax in europe will the secretary of state press the chancellor to reduce the tax burden in this area to help drive local economy that rely on tourism in wales and in constituency such as mine on the isle of wight would gently remind the hon gentleman that his party in government put the high tax burden in year on the people and business of this

many more tourist and hospitality business need to tell the uk government that their closed sign will be go up and stay up due to decision make by the treasury will the secretary of state stand up for the business and job in wales who know that they be be take for the bad ride possible frankly even more vomit induce than megafobia by this government of broken promise last week the hon lady colleague in the senedd vote against extra money for they do maybe she should have conversation with darren millar her colleague in the senedd but do not think they be have that sort of conversation

the uk and welsh governments be appalled to hear that plaid cymru vote against million of extra investment to bring down nhs waiting list in wales but be afraid that this be familiar story for our scottish members do the secretary of state agree that nationalist party will always prioritise niche constitutional distraction over deliver priority for work family and what they need and deserve could not agree more with my hon friend plaid cymru members will have to explain to their constituent why they vote against million extra for the nhs last week block crucial funding from reach our hospital nhs staff and patient in wales one of the issue with waiting list in wales as be the case all across the united kingdom concern those who have be wait first for diabetes diagnosis and then

abduction and kidnapping when we say lasting just settlement for peace in ukraine it must of course involve deal with that issue as he would expect we be raise it continually with our ally telford and britain vote for change in july yet this week we see the bizarre spectacle of the conservatives attempt to bring back the rwanda policy cling on to gimmick that cost british taxpayer million yet send only four volunteer to rwanda as labour work to secure our border through our plan for change do the prime minister agree with that it be quite clear that the conservative party have learn absolutely

for the economy or for work family struggle to make end meet we be put in childcare look at the breakfast club there be two in the right hon lady constituency she be rather forget the billion black hole that the conservatives leave which we have to deal with that be why we have to take the necessary but right measure that we do in the budget what be her response it be not that she would reverse they oh no she do not say that she attack what we have do but she do not say that she would reverse it because she want all the benefit of our budget in term of investment but do not want to pay for it that be how we get into the mess in the first place the prime minister be out of touch he should know that nursery be charge more than for full time care that be year after tax and he be talk about breakfast club he have no idea what people out there be experience it be not just family even council must pay the prime minister job tax to cope with that the average council tax bill be increase by more than in april after he promise to freeze it hard work family money be go to the chancellor instead of to social care and fix pothole why should these family pay more for less the right hon lady really should not denigrate what think she call breakfast club she should be welcome they she ask about council tax the tories put up council tax every year for year their local government association manifesto say that government should remove the cap on council tax hampshire county council which be tory want increase and we say no slough borough council which again be tory want and we say no windsor and maidenhead council which be tory and be now lib dem want and we say no we be the one do the right thing to get this country on the right track the point be that the prime minister promise to freeze council taxis and they be go up if he want to talk about council let we look at liverpool or maybe birmingham where the rubbish be pile up so high people vote labour and all they get be trash just like what he be say at the dispatch box people all over the country be suffer not just in birmingham million of elderly people have have their winter fuel payment snatch away at the same time care home fee be set to go up by devastating because of the prime minister job tax how do he expect pensioner on fix income to make end meet this be why it be so important that wage be up high than price it be why it be so important that interest rate be come down this be the big boost for the cost of live for very long time what we be do be pick up and fix the mess that the tories leave the prime minister be not look at what be happen out there every day speak to business that be tell we that they think they be go bust and as if business and family do not have enough to worry about supermarket say that food price will increase by over because of the job tax that be before we get to the immoral family farm tax on the very farmer who work so hard to produce our food what do the prime minister have against farmer anyway do he not see that his budget be kill farming in this country and that he be make life so much hard for everyone else the budget provide billion for farming over the next two year that be record amount we have set out road map for farming which have be welcome by farmer and many thousand of farm have benefit from the farming scheme the right hon lady talk about price wage be go up high than price it be the first time in long time that that have happen so family across the country be well off under labour the prime minister have get no answer today what the farmer be complain about be the sustainable farming incentive which he have just scrap or withdraw the government be make mistake with this budget which be why in two week the chancellor will come to this house to present an emergency budget that the prime minister say we would not need they will try to make out that it be because of global event but the truth be that the government trash the economy with their bad choice they say that they would look after pensioner then they snatch away winter fuel payment they say that they would be pro business but they hike taxis on job and the prime minister promise to freeze council tax but it be go up by this be high tax low growth job kill government will he use the emergency budget to fix the mess he have make under the tories inflation be with billion black hole and mini budget that make we the laugh stock of the world and they want to give we lecture on the economy no thank you very much with one in eight young people across the country not in education employment or training people in rugby be worried about waste generation too many people with disability and health condition be not get the help they need to get into work so will the prime minister set out how this government will give everyone who be able to work the support they need provide compassion to those who can not work and fix the broken welfare system leave behind by you guess it the conservatives thank my hon friend for raise this issue come from family that deal with disability through my mother and brother over many year so understand the concern he have raise we inherit system that be break it be indefensible economically and morally and we must and will reform it we will have clear principle we will protect those who need protect and we will also support those who can work back to work labour be the party of work and we be also the party of equality and fairness call the leader of the liberal democrats would like to begin by give shout out for young carers action day which be today but promise the house that will not sing the prime minister have rightly speak about the need to get more people into work he have repeat that today so that people have more dignity we can get the economy go and we can cut the benefit bill after the disgraceful legacy leave by the conservatives do the prime minister recognise that the good way to help many disabled people into work be to support they properly through more special equipment training well healthcare and so on will he also today calm anxiety that he himself have raise for many of we by say that disability benefit for people who simply can not work will not be cut as have just say we will support those who need support but help those who can work into work those will be the guide principle what we have inherit be those on the opposition benches ought to be silent one in eight young people be not in education work or training that be lost generation that be the inheritance interruption they have plenty to say now but they do nothing for year and that be terrible inheritance turn to international issue can congratulate the prime minister on help to secure the restoration of us military and intelligence support for ukraine can press he on progress to persuade president trump against the damaging metal tariff that be already hit british industry the prime minister know that we on the lib dem benches believe that we must be more robust with president trump like the europeans and the canadians will the prime minister fly out to canada as soon as possible to show its new prime minister and the canadian people that britain stand with its commonwealth ally against trump threat and trump tariff canada be an ally and very important ally too have speak to our ally on many occasion about the situation in canada on the question of tariff like everybody else be disappointed to see global tariff on steel and aluminium but we will take pragmatic approach we be as the right hon gentleman know negotiate an economic deal which cover and will include tariff if we succeed but we will keep all option on the table lá fhéile pádraig shona daoibh agus seachtain na gaeilge daoibh deis lenár dteanga agus ár gcultúr cheiliúradh ar fud an domhain happy st patrick day everybody and happy irish language week it be an opportunity to use irish language and celebrate irish culture across the world it be an increasingly turbulent world and relationship and norm have be turn upside down over recent week which be why congratulate the prime minister and the taoiseach on re establish warm and firm relationship at their summit last week it be reassure for all of we to know that whatever our constitutional future that bond be last and refresh will the prime minister join in wish happy st patrick day to all who value our share bond may take this opportunity to invite he in august to belfast which be announce this week as the host of the fleadh cheoil na héireann for the first time join the hon lady in wish everybody celebrate very happy st patrick day she be right that we need strong and settle relationship between the united kingdom and ireland and the need for that have never be great that be why be delighted to host the taoiseach in liverpool last week at our first annual uk ireland summit we have turn the page and start new era in our relationship with ireland would be happy to go to belfast in but want to go much soon than that in just day time new sentencing guidance will come into effect that the justice secretary have already concede will be two tier in its nature it will mean that the colour of person skin or their religion can mean that they be view with leniency in the eye of the law it will plunge public confidence in the judiciary into crisis but it be avoidable we conservative have table bill that if back on friday can stop this guidance in its track will the prime minister overrule his justice secretary and confirm here and now that he will back that bill or will he simply step aside and prove that he have be two tier keir all along everyone should be equal before the law and that be why the lord chancellor have take up the issue with the sentencing council but the hon gentleman need to do his homework the proposal that he complain about be draft in and the last government be consult when they be consult what do they say they say they welcome the proposal understand that the shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick be take the sentencing council to court perhaps he should add himself as second defendant so that he can get to the bottom of all this be proud to represent constituency with eight synagogue thriving jewish population and the united kingdom large jewish cultural centre but this week be horrify to read report of rise antisemitism on nhs ward and in particular about shocking incident in which jewish nhs staff member be call baby killer by colleague the nhs that know and love be open to everyone regardless of background what be the prime minister do to ensure that my jewish constituent can safely use our beloved national health service thank my hon friend for raise the subject of those deeply concern report it be completely unacceptable for anyone to experience racism discrimination or prejudice in the health service and know that my right hon friend the health secretary take such report extremely seriously because it be fundamental principle that the nhs provide care and treatment for everyone regardless of race faith or background but it okay in the justice system this be really serious issue the hon gentleman have let himself down and he know it expect all trust and healthcare provider to take necessary action against any staff who have express view that do not reflect the view and value of the nhs durability of uk us relations if he will make an assessment of the durability of uk us relation as the hon gentleman know and as the house know be committed to strengthen those relation the united states be an indispensable ally and we be work together to try to secure just and last peace in ukraine have speak to the president on number of occasion include this week agree with those sentiment this week ceasefire negotiation be cause for great optimism and welcome the effort of the prime minister national security adviser jonathan powell in lead on that priority however last week the prime minister say at the dispatch box in answer to my right hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn that he have no knowledge of the united states plan to withdraw military aid from ukraine which the united states do the follow day it be against that backdrop that ask the prime minister because know he want just and last peace in ukraine that respect ukraine border and territorial integrity what reassurance he can give the house that when he be impress that priority on the president of the united states the president be actually listen let give this reassurance as soon as that step be take my team and start work to try to ensure that we could return to situation of full support for ukraine will not detail everything that be involve over the last week but can assure the hon gentleman and the house that huge amount of hard work discussion and diplomacy be use with all our ally and other to ensure that we could get yesterday to go as well as we hop it would be pleased that we make progress think that be very important for ukraine and be extremely pleased that support have be put in back by the uk so that be what do once understand what have happen be pleased with where we have get to but as ever we must go far engagement disabled people in my constituency be frightened because they be again hear politician use the language of tough choice they know from bitter experience that when politician talk about tough choice it mean the easy option of make the poor and vulnerable pay instead of cut benefit for disabled people would not the moral thing the courageous thing to do be to make real tough choice and introduce wealth tax on the very wealthy people in our society the conservative party leave broken welfare system that lock million out of work and that in my view be indefensible economically and morally of course we must support people who need support we must help those who want to work to get back into work and think there be moral imperative in that my hon friend talk about wealth tax we have raise money through the energy profit levy tax non dom and air passenger duty on private jet but this be not bottomless pit and we must kick start growth to secure the economic stability that we need most people would accept that we need more housing in this country yet so often it be not accompany by the necessary infrastructure in my constituency thousand of house be propose yet without million to upgrade junction of the the inspector be likely to rule our plan unsound will the prime minister use his upcoming planning and infrastructure bill to see how developer and landowner contribution can more effectively build this vital infrastructure which would benefit community up and

volume and speed than it have ever be need block good supply and power enter gaza risk breach international humanitarian law and it should not be happen and we be do everything we can to alleviate

an unprecedented global transition for british farming from leave the european union to the challenge of climate change and geopolitical event we be ask more of farmer than ever before to continue to produce the food that feed the nation and to protect the environment on which our long term food security depend we be determined to create the condition for farm business to be profitable and succeed we be proud to have secure billion for farming over two year the large budget for sustainable food production in our country history that be billion for customer already in agreement billion for farmer now in sfi agreement and furth million for farmer in the sfi pilot labour have get that money out of the door and into farmer pocket we have invest it to bring thousand more farmer into environmental land management scheme which be vastly underspent by the previous government to make record number of capital item available for the come year to help farmer carry out action under the sfi and countryside stewardship with million available for productivity animal health and welfare innovation and other measure to support agricultural productivity as well as landscape recovery project across the country we have respond directly to call from the sector to roll out new high tier scheme and to increase payment rate so that high level stewardship agreement holder many of they upland farmer be fairly reward for their work more than half of all farmer be now in scheme with live sfi agreement and farmer in elm agreement under the sfi hectare of arable land be be farm without insecticide hectare of low input grassland be manage sustainably and km of hedgerow be be protect and restore which be huge success for nature thank all farmer involve and reassure they that all exist sfi agreement will be honour farmer will continue to be pay under the term of their agreement for its duration if they enter into three year sfi agreement early this year they will be pay until if they submit an sfi application but this have not yet start that will also be honour all farmer who take part in the sfi pilot will be able to apply for an agreement with the high uptake of the scheme however the fact be that it be now fully subscribe this government inherit sfi with no spending cap despite finite farming budget and that can not continue we will continue to support farmer to transition to more sustainable farming model include through the thousand of exist sfi agreement over the come year and revamp sfi offer but this be an opportunity to improve how we do that under fair and just farming transition which support farm to be profitable business in their own right through fair supply chain well regulation and great market access and direct public funding in fair and orderly way towards the priority that we have set out on food farming and nature we will be strategic in how we design our scheme and responsible within the available budget this be about use public money in way that support food production restore nature and respect farmer as the business people they be sfi can and must work well for all farm and for nature and will set out the detail of the revised sfi offer follow the spending review include when it will open for application we will work closely with the sector to design an improved scheme so that they can tell we what work well for their business we will also put in place strong budgetary control so that sfi be affordable to the public purse the revised offer will align with our land use framework to well target sfi action fairly and effectively focus on help less productive land contribute to our priority for food farming and nature the underlying problem face the sector however be that farmer do not make enough money the government be change that interruption opposition member may laugh but business do need to make money they might need to know that we announce new set of policy at the national farmers union conference last month aim at improve farm profitability secure our food security and protect nature through our farming road map we be create the condition for farmer to run profitable business that can withstand future challenge this decision be about invest in long term stability it be about future where farmer be support to run profitable business and where public money be use in well way to well restore nature and to secure long term food security call the shadow secretary of state thank the minister for an advance copy of his statement which be go to pull apart in moment thank you as well mr speaker for grant the urgent question that force the minister to the dispatch box because the government sneak this statement out last night presumably hop nobody would notice but guess what the countryside have notice because the question we be all ask ourselves be what have this government get against farmer and the countryside they sneak out this announcement that they be halt the sustainable farming incentive scheme immediately the scheme replace the eu common agricultural policy scheme when we leave the eu we set up this scheme with our brexit freedom to establish farming policy that work for farmer the environment and food production yet labour pull the plug without warn last night the sfi scheme be popular with farmer but the minister do not have to take my word for it to quote one the scheme have the potential to be the most progressive and environmentally responsible scheme of their kind anywhere in the world those be the word of the former president of the country land and business association and father of the hon member for mid and south pembrokeshire henry tufnell who be sure will agree with his father analysis why then would this city dwell government stop such successful scheme in the word of the cla president victoria vyvyan of all the betrayal so far this be the most cruel it actively harm nature it actively harm the environment and with war once again rag in europe to actively harm our food production be reckless beyond belief do the minister think she be wrong the secretary of state by the way be miss in action this be significant statement yet he be send out his junior minister to take the heat perhaps it be because the secretary of state do not want to remind he of his own word in november when he say that farmer feel ignore alienated and disrespect do hope the minister will tell we how that be go this government farming policy can be summarise in three sentence first they will halt any farming and environmental scheme on which farmer rely without warning or consultation use criterion they have never before define secondly the state will seize their farmland at will through the compulsory purchase order that be announce yesterday in the planning and infrastructure bill thirdly if family have manage to cling on to their farm despite all that then labour will tax they for die however be delighted to hear that the minister for farm himself can see that farmer do not make enough money hope he will be change the family farm tax it all add up to nothing less than an outright assault on the countryside as proud rural mp someone who actually like the countryside be already be contact by constituent and farmer across the united kingdom who have have the door slam in their face with no notice ask how they be mean to diversify make living and protect our countryside the prime minister have say he understand the significance of lose farm acknowledge that it can come back and warn against constantly move the goalpost for the agricultural sector yet that be exactly what his government be do the statement issue by the government last night be masterclass in orwellian doublespeak it say that the sfi scheme have reach completion what criterion have they use they have not set those criterion out before the government own website state that up to six week notice would be give for the withdrawal of sfi why be that disregarded last night do the minister recognise that in do so this government have betray the trust of the farming community yet again how many farmer do his department believe will now be catch out without an sfi agreement during the transition period of at least year just as with the family farm tax labour have get its figure wrong the cla have ask to ask the minister some question what be his government ambition for the two third of farmer in england who be not currently in environmental scheme how much have the vast cut to payment under the basic payment scheme save his department and where have that money go how will the secretary of state support upland farmer who be intend to move on to the sustainable farming incentive scheme then of course there be the legal problem cause by last night announcement how will the government meet their legally bind environmental target give that they rely so heavily on the sfi scheme do hope that the minister will be able to give we good clear legal analysis on the impact of the change to sfi on internal market competition law between england and other devolved authority any word that the minister use about food security be meaningless in the face of this policy particularly as we all know that this government have be delay consideration and grant of these application since the general election the figure that the minister be use be wrong and the theory behind this policy be very questionable yet the government would have we all believe that he understand farming and the impact that this measure will have on farmer farmer be in despair my message to farmer be clear we have get your back we will help you so please hang on in there for the next four year we will axe the family farm tax and we will sort out this shocking mess of sfi to help build bright future for british farming with british farmer well really have hop that the shadow secretary of state would understand how the scheme that her own government create actually work let explain the problem that we inherit there be some on the shadow front bench who think understand this well than she this time last year these scheme be undersubscribe they be now oversubscribed it be not complicated thing to say that when the budget be spend responsible government respond to that the budget be spend interruption the budget have be spend and what we be do in sensible serious conservative member should actually be celebrate the fact that so many farmer be now take up these scheme be confident that we will be able to sort out the mess that we have inherit basically if you set up scheme without proper budgetary control you end up in this kind of position we have have to take the hard decision that the previous government duck can the minister confirm that environmental land management scheme agreement will remain in place under this labour government include sfi and that there will be new and well target sfi on offer as soon as possible with detail to follow in the spending review thank my hon friend for her question she make absolutely the right point we should be reassure people out there that farmer who be in scheme be absolutely safe and be carry on as before but the basic point be that when scheme be full it be full call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of his statement the closure of the sfi from last night come without warning or consultation and it constitute the breaking of the government word to farmer farmer be already lose their basic payment this year but they be now exclude from the very scheme design to replace that have the minister not break his word to farmer and to all who care about nature will he clarify how much money he will save from the bps cut this year and say that it be not true that sfi be overspent be it not true that when the bps cut be take into account more than million of the billion farming budget will remain unspent big budget be pointless if we do not spend it this money be suppose to reward farmer for nature restoration and sustainable food production do this not damage both there be new entrant to sfi this year yet only mere of they be hill farm because of the failure of the conservatives in the previous administration the big landowner and the corporate be already comfortably inside the tent but the farmer who be outside and now lock out without warn be britain poor farmer in beautiful place such as mine in the lake and the dale as the tories oversee drop in hill farm income in just five year be this not bitter and unbearable blow for our upland farmer this betrayal will outrage everyone who care for our environment our upland nature and landscape and it will outrage everyone who care about food security and it will outrage everyone who care about our tourism economy it will also outrage everyone who cling to that old fashioned expectation that government should keep their word on monday the secretary of state come to my beautiful constituency to pose for picture by windermere wonder whether he might come back tomorrow and face up to the farmer who steward the stunning landscape around our beautiful lake and who he have abandon so shamefully will he reopen sfi and honour his promise or turn his back on the very people who feed we again be disappoint in the hon gentleman comment he be thoughtful person and he and have debate these issue many time be sorry that he do not welcome the uplift in high level stewardship payment which he and many other have be ask to see for long long time and which will benefit upland farmer take he back to the many discussion that we have have about the importance of get the farm budget out to farmer that be what have happen the full budget be actually be spend and that should be celebrate the fruit and vegetable aid scheme be an important lifeline for our producer collaboration between producer have mean that we have have huge increase in our tonnage of various fruit and vegetable give that the scheme finish on december what plan do we have to support further collaboration between fruit and vegetable producer in and beyond my hon friend ask an important question this be of course an eu legacy scheme and we be consider the good way of take that forward in the future but we be absolutely committed to support and work with the horticultural sector we have around minute remain question must be short and the minister response must be on point and tight call the father of the house will the minister leave for moment the hallowed cloister of cambridge and accept my invitation to take rural ride through lincolnshire the breadbasket of england to meet my farmer do he agree that sustainable farming be the key to food security and therefore will he take up with his colleague in the department for energy security and net zero why they be cover of lincolnshire with solar farm in addition to take away this grant be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question be always happy to visit lincolnshire have do it on number of occasion but on the question of how we allocate our land it be important that we ensure that the new land use framework work effectively as that be the most rational way of make those decision it be extremely welcome that under this government more money be be spend on scheme and that more farmer be in scheme than be the case under the previous government however there be small farm such as those in my constituency in north cumbria that would not have have their plan as far advanced as their large neighbour and their consultant can the minister outline what support will be available to those small farm go forward my hon friend touch on the critical point the scheme that we inherit have no way of prioritise properly it be first come first serve scheme therefore the kind of farmer she describe be disadvantaged we have have to work with scheme that we inherit be very clear when take over that we would not immediately overturn the exist system we want to give people confidence about the future however when we come to redesign the scheme we can design it well to address the issue that she have raise note the minister complaint that he inherit an uncapped budget can he tell the house whether that be something that he just notice on monday which mean that he have to close the scheme without warn on tuesday on january the director general from his department in charge of food biosecurity and trade tell my select committee do not think we can expect that every single farm will be viable but if we be talk about have the opportunity of productivity improvement that be what we be aim for in other word the government aim be to lose to of our farm what will that figure be after today announcement be always grateful to receive question from the right hon gentleman who chair the environment food and rural affairs committee those figure on future farm viability go all the way back to the agriculture act when serious attempt be make to assess future farm viability that be why the secretary of state and be so determined to address those problem around farm viability farmer will not be support forever by the public purse we know that so it be very important that we address the whole range of issue but be very happy to have further conversation with he be sure that the minister share my wish to see bit more humility from conservative members give their failure to get the agricultural budget out of the door interruption would ask the minister if could hear myself think to ensure that every penny in sfi arrangement will be pay to farmer and also that those who have already apply and who be eligible for the scheme will have their application take forward thank my hon friend for that question very much enjoy visit his constituency and talk to farmer there about these issue can absolutely give he that commitment how do the minister expect those who have farm business to plan for the future when he sneak an announcement out like his department do last night despite message on his website say that they would give six week notice of any closure what do the minister have against our farmer and food producer the only thing have anything against be the previous government who set up the scheme in the first place they set it up in way that mean that sfi and sfi be close in exactly the same way sfi be only different in one sense in that it be now oversubscribe rather than undersubscribed as consequence it would not have be possible to give notice because it would have lead to further spike in application as the minister have just allude to the scheme be call sfi might there be clue in the title that make this less surprising than people be say give that it be now be grateful to my hon friend she make sensible point which be that we see succession of scheme announce by the previous government want to get to scheme that will work for the long term my hon friend be absolutely right the way the scheme be set up by the previous government mean that it be first come first serve the overnight withdrawal of the funding be yet another blow to many of my farmer in kingswinford and south staffordshire the minister still have not answer the question as to why he have break his word which be clearly set out on the government website to give at least six week notice nor the one ask by the chair of the select committee the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael which be that if the reason for do so be because the budget have become exhausted when that first come to the minister attention be it really yesterday afternoon it first come to my attention five year ago during the passage of the agriculture act when warn that exactly that would happen if we move from basic payment system where everyone have an entitlement to system that be base on bid that be what happen perhaps the hon gentleman should have wake up five year ago thank the minister for come to the house to make statement however wake up this morning to many email in my inbox from farmer across lancaster and wyre invite the minister to join because be go to accept the invitation from my constituent cath to visit her farm her sfi application be ready to go as she be come out of the countryside stewardship agreement she have therefore be leave in limbo will the minister join in meet farmer across lancaster and wyre as have say to many hon member be always happy to try and meet farmer whenever can and will add my hon friend to my list absolutely understand her point but there be fundamental problem with the scheme as design which we inherit we need to do well in future that be what we will do as we redesign they what assurance can the minister give farmer in my constituency site of special scientific interest have recently be designate in the penwith area which be support by recent designation of landscape recovery we now seem to be in position where there will be no support for that at all how will my farmer adjust to the new regime and what assurance can the minister give they that the funding will be in place to support their action in the sssi there be some complexity in that question that might need to address directly with the hon gentleman landscape recovery be absolutely not affect so it depend on the exact nature of the application can the minister confirm more about the timetable for sfi to provide some reassurance to my farmer in penrith and solway that we will deliver will he also explain little more about how we can ensure that more of my hill farmer get into the sfi scheme which the last government fail to deliver on my hon friend question be important we will work with farmer and organisation to redesign the scheme and that address that very question that will take place over the summer this year and once we have have those conversation we will be able to announce exact timing my hon friend be right to raise the point that there have be no fair allocation of resource it have just be do on first come first serve basis the minister statement say this decision be about invest in long term stability first we have the body blow of the family farm tax the reduction in bps and the pulling of capital grant and now we have the cancellation of sfi how be any farming business expect to invest in the long term the hon gentleman be sensible person and have have many discussion with he over the year when he say pull what he mean be that the budget be complete it be exactly the same in this case think it be important that conservative members understand that we can not spend the same money twice they live in world of cakeism we do not once the money be spend we have to move to new set of scheme when the money be available thank the minister for bring the statement to the house and for show such honesty about the challenge in the scheme may urge he not to take any lecture from the conservative party which oversee chaos in the department for environment food and rural affairs and million underspend that be shameful record will the minister assure the house that he will outline detail to ensure that future scheme get the money out the door and into farmer pocket and stop the waste and bureaucracy that we see under the previous government in defra my hon friend be absolutely right be afraid be genuinely dismay but perhaps not entirely surprised by what find when come into the department we have spend the last six or seven month try to get control of the situation because if we have scheme that be not cap or manage or have no budgetary control there be problem the figure of billion overall be the big amount for farming that we have have we will make sure the money get out to farmer come at time of record low confidence in farming many farmer in glastonbury and somerton will feel that the sudden closure of the sfi scheme will bring they close to close their farm gate for the very last time and at time when food security be at an all time low what communication will go to affected farming business and what support will defra give to those who be deal with vulnerable farmer at the sharp end do not agree with some of the hon lady question because the food security report publish at the end of last year do not bear out her analysis the rural payments agency have write to farmer today set out exactly the situation to give people reassurance meur ras madam deputy speaker be the minister surprise that the conservative party be now cry crocodile tear when it fail to get million of sfi out and into farmer hand and fail to stop speculative acquisition of farmland by tax dodger my hon friend be absolutely right be afraid that as on so many other issue we have to clear up the mess that we inherit that will take time we be set out clear path to the future that hope over time people will come to support do not know how to break this to the minister do not know if he realise this but when the thousand of farmer come to westminster they do not come to thank he or the secretary of state yesterday we have the sustainable farming incentive announcement today there be an announcement that there be to be no extension to the fruit and vegetable aid scheme as be mention by the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel that of course follow the family farm tax the minister announcement today speak very ill of the financial management of his department make no apology for repeat the question ask by my right hon and hon friend when do the minister know that he be hit his budget ceiling when have he set that as criterion what discussion have he have with the treasury to increase the budget why be he deliberately presume mislead farmer by pledge six week notice period when it be not even six second order just before the minister respond the hon member know that he can not use the term deliberately misleading ask he to withdraw that statement inadvertently misleading will take the hon gentleman back to the origin of this debate when we move from basic payment to these scheme there be always go to be point when the budget be spend when do he know we have know it for five year have spend several week and month encourage farmer to access the scheme naturally be disappoint with the closure and hope that there will be replacement in short order however be the fact that so many farmer in my constituency be not access the scheme not evidence that the conservative party fail farmer over many year many farmer be now in these scheme and be benefit from they we be also get the environmental benefit that the whole transition away from basic payment to the environmental land management scheme be design to achieve let give some credit to the opposition they set this train in motion but what they do not do be set up the scheme in way that could properly be manage that be what we be now do yesterday the government shamefully pull the rug out from underneath thousand of farmer by cancel the sfi with zero notice despite say that they would give six week notice and without put in place anything to support farmer in future this morning my inbox be full of email from despair farmer who be on the point of submit an application have no way of planning for this and now be utterly leave in the lurch how do the minister expect the uk to make the vital transition to nature friendly farming and boost uk food production if this be how he treat farmer be astonish by the hon lady contribution she should be celebrate the fact that so many farmer be now farm in an environmentally sensitive way invite she to help we ensure that these scheme work well in future this be actually cause for celebration of the benefit of the environmental land management scheme have also be contact by concerned and impact farmer in north east hertfordshire will the minister assure that for the remainder of this parliament the revamp sfi that he allude to will allow farmer to plan season ahead as they need to clearly over the past five year we have all know that this transition be happen there be always go to be point in the transition from basic payment to environmental land management scheme where it would be down to people apply for these scheme understand my hon friend concern encourage farmer to apply early to these scheme it be first come first serve scheme before in future we will try to ensure that there be well allocation process but that be the system we inherit one of the key message from farmer at the that forum that hold in my constituency be that they have lose trust in this government and in invest in sustainable farming do the minister recognise that end sfi with no warning have only worsen the loss of trust what plan do the government have to restore yeovil farmer confidence in this government hear the hon gentleman but the fact that we have so many people in agreement and so much land be farm within they show that many people in this country have absolute confidence in what we be do how on earth do the minister correlate his statement that he want to work with the sector with the government last night give just minute notice to the nfu the sector of this shameful cut to the sfi budget what do that say about defra previous commitment to transparency co operation and co design this process have be go on for five year now perhaps the hon member should have look bit more closely at what be about to happen trust between farmer and this government be well and truly break farmer feel betrayed and let down and many be at break point the closure of the sfi be bitter and believe calculate blow on top of the family farm tax grab it will be the final straw for many british farmer the people who feed we how can the minister justify send over million to farm in africa asia and south america while strip support for our home grow farmer be grateful to the hon lady for her question but point out to she that this scheme relate to england the different devolve government have different scheme she ask about international aid the key thing for we be to ensure that we support our farmer here which be why we be spend record billion on farming over the next two year the one thing in the minister statement that farmer in my constituency would agree with be that they be not make enough money when as hope the minister take up the invitation from the father of the house to visit lincolnshire will he meet my farmer face to face and explain to they exactly what his government be do to increase their profitability the hon gentleman and have have many exchange across the chamber over the year would be very happy to speak to his farmer and to talk to he about the important work that we be do on supply chain fairness farmer in north shropshire be really keen to improve the environment and farm in friendly way but they be also run business and they need to plan there be farmer in my constituency who be hop to apply for grant to raise the water table in peat soil area but have not yet apply because those grant be not yet open now the opportunity be go what will the minister do to enable farmer to plan and what will the replacement scheme look like the hon lady raise an important point sfi be only one part of the set of department scheme to work with farmer on nature restoration the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend the member for coventry east mary creagh have tell that million be available for peat restoration so other scheme be available no notice and the scheme immediately close the minister say it be full when do he know that why do he not tell the farmer that it be go to happen think there be still misunderstanding about how these scheme work if there be first come first serve scheme and people have know for week and week month that it would be full at some point there come time when we have to make decision if the department be work within its budget properly it can hardly say week or two before that suddenly it will close because there will be spike in application it be like run on bank basically when the scheme be finish it be finish nature food farming and farmer be the foundation of british life in every sense this change be deeply regrettable can the minister assure the house that every support will be give to farmer to adapt to these change and to give they help with the technology that they do not have they be already on their knee will the necessary support be give to stop they from buckle under the load of these successive change hear the hon lady but repeat that we have farmer in elm agreement the majority of farmer be already work with we to make that change to environmentally friendly farming it be never clear how many farmer overall would make the transition into the new scheme obviously it be not matter of compulsion we invite people to apply and they be invite last year when the new scheme come along will invite people to apply the minister be duck and dodge question like poundland alastair campbell he start out with we know five year ago but that very quickly it turn to just week ago he say that this be cause for celebration do not think that any of my farmer will be celebrate this will he come and say these thing directly to my farmer face and see the response that he get do he really want to be minister that much that he be willing to say such ridiculous thing he can find money for lot of other project he should come to fylde and speak to the farmer be go to say that be grateful for the hon member question but be not sure that be invite he to come and talk to people who be engage in nature friendly farming who benefit from these scheme and who be undertake the transition for which give the previous government credit for start we want to move away from the common agricultural policy to new system that be what we be do the scheme be not design well enough and we be now address that be contact by member of the great big dorset hedge initiative three week ago who tell that capital grant under sfi have already be freeze can the minister confirm when the decision to close be actually make whether application submit will be grant and how long applicant will have to wait as farmer be already oblige to improve hedge with more than gap under their agreement how will they access funding to do so to enable their exist funding to be maintain the hon lady raise an important set of point we now have km of hedgerow within these scheme the basic point be that we have fix budget and just as with the capital grant when they be spend they be spend another set of grant will be available and invite her constituent to apply at that point we can not get away from the fact that there be not an endless supply of money we have to work within the budget understand the minister point that it have be know all along that at some point the fix budget would be exhaust simple question for he on which day be ministers first inform that that budget have be exhaust we make the decision yesterday because we reach that point it be begin to feel little like game of top trumps in who can cause the most financial unpredictability to farmer be it through the botched elms roll out or the cancellation of this scheme at moment notice half of britain fruit and veg farmer expect to go out of business the minister say that he will support farmer to be profitable through fair supply chain but will he explain what that will look like be grateful to the hon lady for that very big question point she to the fair deal power in the agriculture act some of which have already be bring forward in the dairy sector and we will be work on the pig sector soon basically sector by sector we be try to sort out the improvement that be need to get fairness throughout the supply chain that be big difficult and complicated question but it be essential for the future the announcement be sneak out with no notice last night if the minister know anything about farming he will know that it take month if not year to plan farmer have no notice of this will he tell we what will replace the sfi when he will consult and when it be likely to come into operation over the next few month through the spending review we will review how we can improve the scheme to avoid the very point that the hon gentleman have just make and will report back to the house later in the summer meet young farmer at duchy college in north cornwall last week and it be clear that confidence in the farming sector be at an all time low with many look for alternative career in the light of the government hammer blow to sfi payment on top of the family farm tax how do the minister plan to incentivise young people to get into farming now that they face huge tax bill upon inherit their family farm and will no long be incentivise to undertake environmental stewardship and sustainable farming completely disagree with the premise of the question as the hon gentleman will probably realise he be right to say that we need generational change in farming and there be number of way in which that can happen it be not funny be not laugh this be very serious point be genuinely concerned about the future of the farming sector if we do not get generational change we will look closely at how we can do that the billion budget that we secure be very good first step for stability farmer in chichester be exhaust by the ever change scheme and the time it take to apply for they imagine their surprise when they find out that the sfi scheme have be close not with no notice think that be unfair but with the nfu give minute notice as oppose to the six week that it be promise at time when bps scheme be be significantly reduce what communication and support will be provide to the family farm that have miss out on this round of sfi funding it should have be clear to people for long long time that this transition be come it be the move away from system base on entitlement for every farmer through the basic payment scheme to system that rely on people apply to what be essentially fixed budget agree with the hon lady and many other member that the way the system be set up do not allow for proper prioritisation or fairness in allocation that be what we would like to change in future but it be the system that we inherit and be afraid that that be where we be at the moment the house should remember that the majority be already in scheme and to those who have not yet come forward gently say for the future that the advice in these kind of scheme be that it be well to apply early rather than to wait the sudden completion of the sfi scheme will be worry for many farmer and local people be also very concerned by report that the nfu be give only minute notice on such huge change to give my local farmer the confidence that they need can the minister assure they that defra will learn lesson from the poor communication and lack of clarity that have plague this and past initiative let repeat the point this be not about communication if we suddenly say that scheme with fix amount of money in it will close in two or three week we would get surge in application and have to close it the same day that be flaw in the way the scheme be originally design and we want to do well in future international event have push national security right up the agenda and be sure that we have cross party acknowledgment that food security be vital part of national security give the change geopolitical situation have an impact assessment be undertake on change to and stressor for farming budget and cash flow such as the removal of sfi and their effect on food security the hon gentleman make an important point refer he to the food security report there have be no change to the amount of money available the billion budget be there this be discussion about who get it will the minister explain to farmer in horsham why he do not feel any need to consult any farming stakeholder in advance of this announcement again refer the hon gentleman to the point that make early if we start consultation on first come first serve scheme everybody would apply that day and we would have to shut it at that point that be flaw in the way the scheme be design the minister be much like in this chamber as we all know however it be disappointing to hear that new application for the sustainable farming incentive have be pause in england it be understandable that that be see as betrayal by so many farmer agricultural support be different in northern ireland but the funding come none the less from central government will the minister assure that funding for northern ireland farmer which come from here will not be reduce or falter as result of today announcement and that step will be take to protect our agriculture industry and our farmer who be the backbone of our economy thank the hon gentleman for his kind word and suspect that we shall renew our acquaintance in westminster hall this afternoon can assure he that this announcement will make no difference to the funding arrangement for northern ireland point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker the minister for food security and rural affairs the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner have be ask repeatedly why no notice be give to farmer of the closure of the sfi scheme he have give range of answer include that people have know for week and week month he even stretch it to five year ago this be important not least because business decision be have to be make on the fly today but also because there may be legal consequence to the answer that the minister have give how can we encourage the minister to correct the record and state the fact that no notice be give to farmer be grateful to the right hon member for give notice of her point of order the chair be not responsible for the accuracy of ministers statement in the house but she have put her point of order on the record do not believe that the minister wish to respond indicate dissent then will end that there on point of order madam deputy speaker would like to correct the record and make declaration of interest in my excitement while make my first intervention during proceeding on the employment rights bill yesterday do not point member to my entry in the register of members financial interests or mention my proud membership of the community gmb and unison union would like to ensure that that be on the record as well as in the register thank the hon member for advance notice of her point of

hon friend the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison publish record of blood and urine test relate to nuclear test veteran he say at that time that there be it have now become clear from the correspondence of court case bring by the british nuclear test veteran that there be document mention blood and urine that include that be previously unseen and unreleased that raise the possibility as you will appreciate madam deputy speaker that the atomic weapons establishment mislead ministers about the number of record and that inadvertently and entirely innocently the minister bring the wrong information to this house seek your guidance on how the government can correct the record and publish those extra record the nuclear test veteran deserve nothing less be grateful to the right hon member for give notice of his point of order the chair be not responsible for the accuracy of ministerial statement in the house but he have put his point on the record and no doubt those on the

institution payment scheme which open to application last march the scheme represent measure of accountability for what happen recognise the lifelong impact that time spend in those institution will have have the impact will be feel in all corner of survivor life from earn potential and financial security to physical and mental health and wellbeing ultimately the scheme aim to acknowledge the

compensation under our current rule any money accept through this payment scheme would be consider saving and could see they lose mean test benefit and financial support for social care for some it be deter they from make any application at all it be one of the reason that only of survivor in britain have apply so far for other have receive compensation offer they be now have to weigh up whether it

that he or his brother and sister exist until we do some family trace it would have be lovely to meet he but do not feel that can use the money for this as my benefit would be affect the whole point of the payment scheme be to recognise the suffering that survivor experience while resident but for many it have become an additional burden process that have force they to revisit their most traumatic experience seemingly to no avail fortunately there be solution and it be relatively simple one the introduction of an indefinite capital disregard which my bill propose would remove any risk to an applicant benefit there be strong precedent for such disregard the same arrangement have be apply to similar special compensation scheme in the recent past include those introduce for the victim of the london bombing and for payment make under the windrush compensation scheme want to pay tribute to some of the many incredible organisation in britain that continue to support mother and baby

here in britain in ireland and elsewhere who summon the courage to share their personal experience and to recount their most traumatic year in the name of justice their bravery not only secure the apology from the irish government and subsequently bring about the payment scheme but perhaps more importantly contribute enormously to the hard and crucial work of dismantle the stigma and secrecy that have long be associate with time spend in mother and baby home that of course include philomena lee whose own story bring this injustice to global audience be delighted that philomena daughter jane and her grandson joshua be here in the gallery with we today ireland mother and baby home be cruel institution over seven decade ten of thousand of irish woman be send there for the perceive sin of become pregnant outside of marriage they be subject to the most horrific mistreatment and abuse physical and psychological woman be use as unpaid labour they have their child forcibly adopt sometimes overseas never to be see again the woman and child fortunate enough to leave the institution often come here to britain they come here to escape the stigma and shame and build new life and there be more than survivor live here today last year the irish government open long await compensation scheme for those survivor it be small but important mark of accountability and redress for what happen to they but thousand of survivor in britain today can not access this compensation without be penalise for it if they access it they lose any mean test benefit or financial support for social care just as we do for the windrush family we must now change the law to ensure that compensation payment for victim and survivor be ringfence this bill philomena law name after the inspirational and

protection to the point at which the cac accept an application for recognition or derecognition and will ensure that employer can not increase the size of the bargaining unit for the purpose of the recognition application after the application be make that will end the deliberate gaming of the system that we have see in recent year the amendment will also delete the second test for determine an unfair practice complaint which currently require the cac to consider how an alleged unfair practice may have affect worker vote in the recognition or derecognition ballot they will extend the time limit in which unfair practice can be report after the ballot close to five work day they will ensure that an employer can not recognise non independent trade union after receive request for voluntary

fund ballot new clause and associated amendment remove the requirement for union to hold ballot every year on maintain political fund instead union will provide reminder about member right to opt out

agency so that where employer be not do what be right simplified and strengthen enforcement system will protect worker and ensure justice in the workplace the fair work agency need the right tool to do the job series of amendment form package that will give the fair work agency the tool that it need to hold all employer to account more effectively that be fair for worker and business the government be move amendment to introduce new power that be key to the fair work agency core enforcement role new clause to create civil penalty regime under the regime enforcement officer will be able to issue notice of underpayment and impose penalty on employer who have underpaid individual in breach of statutory pay right that be within the remit of the fair work agency as result the agency may be able to help worker get the money they be owe more quickly than if they have to go through an employment tribunal where proceeding before the tribunal be necessary we want the fair work agency to be able to support individual and ensure that the tribunal time be use as effectively as possible new clause do that by enable the agency to bring proceeding before the employment tribunal if individual be unwilling or unable to under clause the agency can also offer advice and assistance to individual bring employment relate case before the court or tribunal the government be also move amendment to upgrade the power that the fair work agency will need to tackle labour abuse effectively the bill committee hear from stakeholder include eleanor lyons the uk independent anti slavery commissioner about bad practice in the social care sector the gangmasters and labour abuse authority be prevent from investigate many case because they do not meet the modern slavery threshold the fraud act cover situation that amount to labour abuse but fall short of be modern slavery today we be bring forward two amendment that will deliver the government commitment to give the fair work agency the strong power that it need to tackle labour exploitation we will enable fair work agency enforcement officer to use their power to investigate such case help the agency to protect the most vulnerable in the workforce we will also give enforcement officer the ability to issue special warning follow arrest in practice that mean tell suspect that if they refuse to answer question about certain item or their whereabouts that could be use against they in court only employer have be prosecute for national minimum wage violation since the measure that the minister be bring forward will improve enforcement he touch on the modern slavery act but he do not address the point make in the debate yesterday will he use this opportunity to say more about the government intention to update the modern slavery act be grateful for the chair of the select committee intervention we accept that there be gap between the modern slavery network enforcement process and current employment right enforcement we be work with the home office and the glaa to improve that these be thing we can continue to work on as we develop the scope and remit of the fair work agency as well as reform and strengthen the power the government be move amendment to expand the remit of the fair work agency to ensure effective enforcement of statutory sick pay and holiday pay today amendment will bring northern ireland ssp legislation into the scope of the fair work agency and will introduce requirement for the secretary of state to obtain the consent of the northern ireland executive before bring any far devolve legislation in scope further amendment will bring within the agency scope the duty in the working time regulation for employer to retain record relate to holiday pay and annual leave for six year it be the government intention for the fair work agency to take on enforcement of new protection relate to zero hour contract that be subject to consultation on the detail and to the outcome of the spending review new clause give the fair work agency the power to recover the cost of take enforcement action from business that be find to be non compliant with the law that be in recognition of the polluter pay principle it be similar to how other regulator operate such as the health and safety executive we will consider carefully and discuss the matter with business as appropriate before exercise that power but it be an important principle that where there be wrong the person in the wrong make some contribution towards the cost to the taxpayer of enforce the law to sum up know many people be eager to speak in the debate the bill will ensure that workplace right be fit for modern economy empower work people and contribute to economic growth urge hon member to support the bill and the amendment that we be move today which show that we be pro business pro worker pro family and pro growth call the shadow minister ahead of get into the detail of the many amendment before we which the minister rattle through in just minute let say that overnight we learn that the government be move the responsibility of one quango to another they be move the responsibility of the payment systems regulator to the financial conduct authority put one quango into another conveniently they already share building the prime minister have hail that as the late step in the government attempt to kick start economic growth though the amendment we be discuss do the very opposite the chancellor say the regulatory system have become burdensome to the point of choke off innovation investment and growth but that be precisely what the bill do do not know how the government can say that with straight face when as we stand here today block regulatory burden cost every business in the land small medium or billion in the chamber yesterday it be quite clear that the minister and his team do not fully understand the definition of small business be sure that my hon friend the shadow minister do understand it do he agree that that be fundamental to understand why the balance of this legislation be wrong my right hon friend make superb point as she always do every single small business that have talk to in my constituency be very concerned about the measure in this on that point will the shadow minister give way will if hour on he can name small business that support the bill be ask the shadow minister to give way but the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton could have intervene on during my speech one of the reason why there be so much confusion about the definition of small business be that the shadow minister move an amendment in committee that say that small business mean an organisation or person employ or few report employment rights public bill committee december so if there be any confusion it be on the conservative benches twenty four hour later the minister still can not name small business that support the bill that show how out of their depth this trade union government be when it come to support business in this land in the word of the chancellor this bill be choke off innovation investment and growth to pretend otherwise would be take the public for fool on new clause and almost everything this government have do be contradictory to the objective of growth if that remain their objective this week whether it be the national insurance job tax the change to business rate or this bill everything they do seemingly go against grow the economy it be little surprise that under labour the economy be flatline the prime minister say early this year that everything the government do will be subject to growth test however the detail of that test have be sparse at good so sparse in fact that people may well think it do not exist could the shadow minister describe liz truss growth test well cut red tape for start we see from lib dem members that the orange book tradition of the liberal democrats be well and truly dead they now position themselves firmly to the left of the labour party there be no great evidence that the growth test do not exist than the bill because if such test do exist this bill would fall at the first hurdle but today come with good news have two amendment that the government can back this afternoon to help they to grow the economy those amendment be of course new clause and new clause new clause would require the certification officer to advance the objective of the international competitiveness of the economy and new clause would require the secretary of state who be again not in his place to have regard to international competitiveness when pass regulation under part of the bill concern the trade union the government have be ask regulator for idea to boost growth it be contradiction in term to ask the regulator to boost growth but we be happy to help they with their quest the government should be able to support these amendment if they can not it show that they be not serious about economic growth and more tellingly that they do not intend to use the power in part of the bill to achieve growth or international economic competitiveness because they do not intend to exercise they in way that be compatible with those objective new clause on trade union political fund will be sure get the government little bit hot under the collar this be labour party first country second government nowhere be that clear than in the change that the government be make to the political fund through the bill let we be in no doubt that the change have one simple purpose to bolster the coffer of the labour party clause will mean that member of trade union will automatically contribute to their trade union political fund without be ask about it first member will have to opt out rather than opt in as they do at present interruption do someone want to try to defend that no okay if trade union subscription be to be use for party political campaigning it should be conscious decision of the trade union member to endorse such campaigning the shadow minister may recall that in committee every single labour member of the committee declare sponsorship by the trade union movement do he agree with that this clause be simply payback for the trade union movement after its financial support for the labour party my hon friend serve assiduously on the committee raise many good point include the one that he just make which absolutely agree with the public will be ask serious question about this rise if the hon gentleman want to try to defend that will give he the opportunity be happy to declare my interest as member of three trade union but get less from they than the shadow minister get from small business think his declaration be do he feel the need to declare that give that he be now make case against legislation that would impact that company be make point about the trade union movement which have never be part of and certainly never receive any money from be happy for the hon gentleman to look at all my declaration in the register of members financial interests on point of order madam deputy speaker be it really point of order we can find out madam deputy speaker believe it be can you advise whether conservative members who receive money from business affect by this legislation should make declaration in the same way that we trade unionist do this be go to end up in back and forth on thing that be not matter for the chair declaration be the responsibility of individual member to make appropriately through the right process for the avoidance of all doubt and in all transparency declare all my entry in the register of members financial interests for all to look at they be all there for anybody to see this argument about opt in and opt out of trade union levy go back to at least the probably beyond when remember argue about it as an undergraduate if there be to be levy that people have to opt out of defensible case can be make for they provide that the process of opt out be easy and advertise to every member do my hon friend know whether the government propose to institute mechanism to make it know to every member how easily they can opt out my right hon friend make an incredibly important point if we look at the detail of this bill it be very clear and obvious that the government be try to make it as difficult as possible for people to opt out of the trade union political fund that be the very point of they change this legislation will the shadow minister give way will make bit of progress then will come to the hon lady an opt in be the default under consumer protection law and information law combine with the year reminder change it be highly likely that many trade union member will not be aware that their subscription be be use in this way or that they be eligible to save money on their trade union fee by not be member of the political fund despite all the talk of support work people it be clear that that concern simply do not apply when work people money be be take to fund the labour party and other political cause we have table amendment because we believe fundamentally that people should consent explicitly to what be in effect subscription trap amendment would simply maintain the status quo it be the right thing to do draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests be member of community and the union of shop distributive and allied workers can the hon gentleman tell we how many time such ballot have actually result in the closure of political fund think he will find that the answer be none the hon lady be put up smoke and mirror argument to try to cover the fact that the government be change the status quo from an opt in system to an opt out system to it be just straightforward common sense that people would expect to have to opt in rather than in this particularly egregious case be casually remind every year that they could save bit of money by opt out of cause that they perhaps do not even agree with in the first place in fact the secretary of state for business and trade the right hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds pledge to end auto renewal subscription when the conservatives be in government we pass the digital markets competition and consumers act which contain two significant proposal on subscription contract that be notable here one of those be reminder notice business need to provide notice to consumer to remind they that their subscription contract will renew and payment will be due unless the consumer cancel the second proposal be to allow consumer to be able to exit subscription contract in straightforward cost effective and timely way business need to ensure that the process for terminate be not unduly onerous and that consumer can signal their intent to end the contract through single communication the labour party which be then in opposition support those aim in fact the bill do not go far enough for labour at the time on report the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones table new clause which the labour party vote to add to the bill the new clause have two pronged approach it require trader to ask consumer whether they wish to opt into subscription renew automatically either after period of six month and every six month thereafter or if the period between the consumer be charge for the first and second time be long than six month each time payment be due the second aim of the new clause which the labour party use to support would have require that if the consumer do not opt into the arrangement describe the trader have to provide date by which the consumer must notify the trader of the consumer intention to renew the contract which must be no early than day before the renewal date if the consumer do not provide notification the subscription contract could not renew where be go with this interruption government members be chuntere too early because there have be considerable shift in the labour party policy position on subscription trap it seem to believe that consumer should be give every possible opportunity to cancel subscription contract with business but that it should be as hard as possible to cancel subscription to the trade union political fund under amendment and new clause trade union member would have the same right push for by labour as other individual with subscription new schedule could be use to give sweeping power to labour trade union paymaster as the secretary of state could reduce the threshold for trade union recognition to as little as of the workforce trade union could easily be impose on workplace across the country with small employer be particularly vulnerable in workplace of worker few than five of they would be require for workplace recognition pair with the other measure in this bill that will strike fear into business owner across britain who could now be force to deal with all powerful trade union as part of labour return to the the way in which labour have go about this be just another example of the shoddy nature of this bill and of labour approach to workplace regulation the attorney general have say that excessive reliance on delegate power henry viii clause or skeleton legislation upset the proper balance between parliament and the executive this not only strike at the rule of law value have already outline be quote he but also at the cardinal principle of accessibility and legal certainty on facility time amendment and would remove clause facility provide to trade union official and learn representative and clause facility for equality representative they would remove the requirement to provide reasonable time off for facility time the creation of facility time for equality representative and clause that will reduce transparency requirement over facility time respectively together with amendment they would prevent facility time for equality representative from be provide unless the relevant public sector organisation be meet its statutory target for performance trade union facility time already cost the government nearly million year under the last labour government the civil service spend of its annual pay bill on facility time compare with in the private sector under the last conservative government in the average for the civil service be labour council be still the bad culprit the transparency datum collect by the government in show that transport for london under the mayor of london sadiq khan have full time equivalent union official on the book cost million year bankrupt labour run birmingham city council have full time equivalent union official on its central book cost million no wonder that it go bankrupt furthermore the council have full time equivalent in its maintain school cost clause and will increase that cost by give more time off to public sector union official at the taxpayer expense that be not right when the chancellor be ask ministers to make cut to their department across the board public service will be bad and the taxpayer will be expect to contribute more furthermore the bill extend the right to facility time to equality representative who will now be allow pay time off work to carry out activity for the purpose of promote the value of equality in the workplace arrange learn or training on matter relate to equality in the workplace provide information advice or support to qualify member of the trade union in relation to matter relate to equality in the workplace consult with the employer on matter relate to equality in the workplace and obtain and analyse information relate to equality in the workplace those be all noble goal but that should not be do at the taxpayer expense do the shadow minister agree that the only job that will be create by these bills be for people employ by trade union before mr smith respond to that intervention must add that we have just shy of people hop to contribute to this debate and want to get they all in as ever madam deputy speaker take your advice and will speed up interruption the minister urge to carry on but of course would not ignore your advice never say never again make no comment on the value that those activity will add to public sector employer and their productivity what will say be that we have already see this government be happy to hand over large pay increase to trade union with no guarantee of anything in return that be why we have table amendment and in an attempt to ensure that the taxpayer get something out of this late concession to the trade union on amendment trade union can create significant disruption in the economy whether by stop work from take place or prevent people from get to work school hospital appointment or many other activity we must strike fair balance between the ability of trade union to strike and the public whom we all serve our amendment will mean that vital public service such as the nhs can well plan and prepare for strike it simply seek to keep the status quo of two week notice without adequate warning constituent of member from across the house be more likely to miss hospital appointment not be able to travel to see love one or get to work or suffer great disruption when school close due to strike that be part of the reason why in the consultation on threshold of those who respond support retain the day period as it currently be with prefer long period two third of respondent therefore want the period to stay the same or be long labour promise that it would work with business on this bill but its response to that consultation be just another example of the government have their finger in their ear and simply not listen the reduction to day be against the wish of business and will do harm to all our constituent that be why we have table amendment to retain the notice period of day on amendment strike should only take place when there be clear mandate for they but clause will mean that strike can happen with low threshold by remove the turnout requirement and the support requirement combine with government amendment to extend the mandate for strike from six month to month this bill allow union to unleash wave of low support roll strike those cost will come on top of the national insurance job tax and change to business rate mistake that the government be already make make it more difficult to run business that be why we have table amendment which will remove clause there be much in this bill to speak to madam deputy speaker but will not test your patience or the patience of the house far by go into those thing look forward to thorough debate that will far point out not least through conservative members contribution why the amendment to this bill that the government have table this afternoon will harm our economy destroy job and just give more power to the trade union rise on point of order madam deputy speaker be it pertinent to the actual debate yes madam deputy speaker as we all know member be require to draw attention to any potential conflict of interest prior to speak in order to avoid any impression of among other thing pay advocacy give that clause will lead directly to increase payment of money from union to labour members of parliament ask for guidance on the proper declaration of interest most labour members due to speak this afternoon have receive thousand of pound from the union tot up make it in addition to general reference to their entry in the register of members financial interests in this instance where there be direct link should they not also set out the actual amount of money they have receive obviously further clarity on this issue be require as it be raise early it be the responsibility of individual member to ensure that they declare their interest properly the procedure for raise complaint of this sort be by write to the parliamentary commissioner for standards the guide to the rule set out the rule relate to the declaration of interest in debate this be not otherwise matter for the chair hope that bring some further clarity to the issue call the chair of the business and trade committee thank you madam deputy speaker will start with my declaration of interest as former member of the confederation of british industry and current member of the trade union unison will try to introduce few point of consensus to the debate be old enough to remember when conservative member such as the former member for harlow be write pamphlet for think tank such as demos with title like stop the union bash why conservative should embrace the trade union movement of course that be an echo of something that harold macmillan famously use to say in the we use to think that we could not have modern industrial society without trade union still think that think we would all benefit from little acknowledgment that industrial relation in this country have not be in good place in more day be lose to strike than at any point in the past year and the office for national statistics calculate at the back end of that million day have be lose to strike action that be not record that any one of we in this house should be proud of it be incumbent on all of we to modernise industrial relation in this country so that we be not divide in the workplace in this way as such welcome the measure in this bill hope that the minister will seize the moment not only the fact that we have the bill but the advent of an industrial strategy that will introduce governance arrangement that get business and union around the table to talk about economic growth in our country that be big opportunity it be big moment in which we can bring our country together around modern industrial strategy hope that once the minister have get this bill do and have have little bit of rest maybe go on holiday for bit he will think about how the government will then publish modern industrial strategy for the future back by the restoration of some of the datum that we use to have in this country such as the workplace employee survey we have that until about when it be stop we need to be more thoughtful about harmony in the workplace because that be in the interest of the constituent we serve the right hon member use the term modernise industrial relation which sound little like euphemism take he at his word however be he not therefore surprised that the pay rise that have be give to doctor train driver and number of other union since this government come in have not be accompany by any requirement for increase productivity if we be to have modernise industrial relation surely the increase pay that union want should be combine with the productivity gain that this country need the hon member will no doubt have hear the remark make by the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster at the weekend suspect that the hon member like every member of this house will see some pretty radical step take in the comprehensive spending review to improve the efficiency of the civil service of course the civil service grow very significantly in the year after covid and now it have to be reinvent for new time be confident that those productivity gain will come my second point be to draw the house attention to some of the evidence take by our select committee that evidence be contain in our report which commend to all hon member what strike about the evidence we hear from the most productive firm in the country such as jaguar land rover rolls royce and bae systems be that those be world beat company some of the most productive company in our country and what characterise the workplace arrangement of all of those company be that they have very long stand robust and deep partnership with good trade union those trade union help make decision help de conflict thing and help business thrive and succeed that be why strong collective right be important we also take evidence from company where be afraid to say there be not that harmony such as amazon it have have to call ambulance to its warehouse time in just five year we on the committee receive whistleblow evidence from worker who be literally have to urinate into bottle because they do not dare take time out from their task to go to the bathroom and back we hear all kind of whistleblow complaint about injury be sustain and pay be rise much more slowly than sale when we have executive from that company in front of we they could not or would not tell the committee why strike action have be take by worker in their firm if company executive can not explain to select committee of this house why so many of their worker be on strike that be not story of harmony or recipe for success that be why the measure that the minister have bring forward in this bill to improve the opportunity for trade union to organise in way that be recommend by the former member for harlow actually be good thing the minister have go some way in recognise recommendation make by our committee such as improve the window in which complaint can be hear beyond hour bring in template access agreement and strengthen the role of the central arbitration committee in dispute resolution there be just one further step that suggest which be the subject of amendment we suggest that access right for trade union should include digital access right because in the modern workplace of which amazon be case in point there simply be not an opportunity for worker to get information about the opportunity to join trade union and make fair choice one way or the other in the way that there could be in the modern economy my final point be about enforcement the first factory act pass by this house be the health and morals of apprentices act it be celebrate in parliamentary history as an act that fail because there be no enforcement attach to it enforcement of this bill be essential if it be to succeed but labour market enforcement today be much too weak just employer have be prosecute for minimum wage enforcement since despite the fact that we all know that abuse of this sort be take place in our constituency spend on labour market enforcement have be flat since and we be well off the international labour organisation target of one labour market inspector for every worker new clause in my name would require the secretary of state to set out road map for reach that ilo target for ensure there be great use of penalty where appropriate and for much strong partnership between the home office the police and the fair work agency we can not have situation in this country where the good of british firm be be undercut by the bad labour market practice in conclusion welcome this bill some of the amendment that have be table would improve it but ultimately we have to remember that if we want to create genuinely pro business pro worker economy the measure in this bill be long overdue call the liberal democrat spokesperson rise to speak to part and of the bill and specifically to new clause table by my hon friend the member for torbay steve darling and new clause and which stand in my name wish to put on record my thank to my two liberal democrat colleague my hon friend the members for torbay and for chippenham sarah gibson for their work in the public bill committee alongside many other member of the house overall throughout its passage we liberal democrats have indicate our support for many aspect of the employment rights bill such as those we debate yesterday include boost statutory sick pay strengthen parental pay and leave and give people on zero hour and low hour contract more certainty however lot of crucial detail have be leave to secondary legislation to lot of new government amendment and to continue consultation which make it impossible to explicitly endorse the bill as whole at this stage even with amendment in committee and government amendment on report major issue be still yet to be determine especially in part even after all those amendment the government say that they intend to consult far on modernise the trade union landscape follow royal assent of this bill include on admissibility requirement code of practice and secondary legislation it be therefore clear that part which we be debate today be still far from finalised we liberal democrats believe that employee participation in the workplace be vital but we also believe that it should go hand in hand with wide employee ownership that be so important for diffuse economic power promote enterprise increase job satisfaction improve service to customer and get long term economic stability and growth the government proposal on trade union be aim at strengthen employee right in what can often be combative and confrontational working environment and we liberal democrats see this bill as miss opportunity to improve employee engagement and ownership to provide collaborative working environment and long term growth whether by reform company purpose rule or put duty on employer to encourage employee ownership in large list company however give what we have before we we have table few amendment first new clause be about the right to be accompany and it do what it say on the tin it would expand the right for staff to be accompany by certify companion at disciplinary and grievance hearing that be long stand liberal democrat policy and hope it be not too controversial as it simply rectify an anomaly the current law allow only trade union representative or colleague to accompany an employee and that leave many without proper support some sector such as the medical profession already allow accompaniment by non union companion yet that be not reflect in law our target amendment would fix that anomaly and urge the government to accept it new clause simply request that the government conduct review on the impact on small business throughout the bill passage we have express concern about the cumulative impact of all the government work in this area and the impact it will have on small business in particular just the other day the federation of small businesses tell that it spend thousand and thousand of hour give advice to small business on employment matter and these new obligation will create huge amount of extra law for they to understand interpret and apply small business do not have the same resource as big business they often have no legal department no compliance team and perhaps no human resource specialist because small business be often root in their community they be conscious of their reputation they know their employee and they want to get thing right that mean it will take extra time effort and cost for they to navigate and comply with this part of the bill and that be before we get to everything else that the government be seek to introduce small business be tell that take the measure of the employment bill together with the change to national insurance and business rate and everything else they feel overwhelmed all that new clause do be ask the government to conduct an impact assessment we know that small business be passionate about their employee small business be often the one to give people their first job they be often the company that give people second chance they provide part time flexible working and opportunity to return to work so encourage the government to look at the impact of part on small business new clause be about introduce legal aid in employment tribunal when legal aid be first introduce the intention be for it to become the nhs of the justice system but we know that today legal aid be far from that our amendment would require the secretary of state to report on option for expand the right to legal aid in employment tribunal we already know that many employee can not afford legal representation and that create an imbalance of power when face well resource employer the amendment simply ask the government to look at the option that might be available in that regard new clause ask for review of the single enforcement body we liberal democrats positively support the government effort to create single point of contact rather than four similar measure be in our manifesto where we call for powerful new worker protection enforcement authority as matter of good practice when put different organisation together it be important to make sure that no gap be create in that protection the review we ask for be not just formality but an important safeguard to ensure that employment right enforcement be effective fair and fit for purpose there be much in the bill that we liberal democrats welcome but there be many part of it that we simply can not support because it be not yet clear what the government intention be we urge the government in the strong possible term to look at the impact on small business as it be an area about which we be deeply concerned it be pleasure to speak in the debate follow the speech from the shadow minister the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith have to remind he that trade unionist be the bedrock of our community they be the producer of the wealth in this country they be taxpayer and they be ordinary hard work people they should not be describe as basically the dirt on the shoe of other people the shadow minister could hardly hide his disdain for ordinary work people he could not hold himself back from oppose everything in the bill begin by declare my interest as proud trade union member member of the national union of mineworkers and unite the union and an honorary member of the prison officers association and as the chair of the trade union group of labour mps it be pleasure to speak about piece of legislation that turn the tide on decade of anti trade union law law that have restrict the power of worker and see the wealth of those at the top grow exponentially on personal note let say that it be fitting that the bill should be before the house this week last wednesday mark year since along with my father who have sadly pass on my brother and thousand of my colleague march back to work at the end of the miner strike the fact that although bruised and batter be still here today speak about the bill prove that while the party of vulture capital may have win victory in they do not win the war this be good bill but it could have be lot well through further time further discussion and further legislation it will prove to be great bill and believe that the new clause and amendment that have table would strengthen and enhance it worker in the uk have never ever have the right to strike but since their union have have protection against common law liability subject to the meeting of statutory condition new clause would establish positive right to strike bring the uk into line with most of the democratic world it would also remove provision that make strike action unlawful if it turn out retrospectively that the action the worker take be unofficial that be important because worker currently have to take it in good faith that the union have manage to navigate the bureaucracy of take action and that unscrupulous boss can not summarily dismiss they if it have not new clause be wide ranging the uk ban on secondary action be almost unique in the world condemn on every occasion when the international labour organisation have consider the position since when ferry flout its legal obligation by not consult over mass dismissal and by dismiss people unfairly the union be unable to react by call on dock worker lorry driver and worker in other industry on the dockside to boycott the vessel in dispute that be outrageous we need to bring back solidarity action want to support people in industrial dispute and new clause would put situation like that right by end the ban on secondary action it would remove the need to provide ballot paper to the employer remove the obligation on union in long run dispute to rerun the ballot every six month and enable industrial action to achieve recognition for collective bargaining amendment and would change the requirement for notification about the result of union ballot mean that they could be display online with easy access for the public amendment and would remove the restriction confine picket to the worker workplace the reason secondary picketing be ban in the first place be the fact that it be tool that benefit worker and advance their cause solidarity action should be an important part of seek the resolution of dispute the bill bring measure that aim to end discrimination and place equality at the heart of the workplace it give key worker in social care and school support more say in pay and condition through their union it bring measure to tackle exploitative zero hour contract give protection against unfair dismissal from day one and extend sick pay right it repeal minimum service level law and the majority of the reactionary trade union act provide great right for worker to organise collectively through their trade union and reduce bureaucracy affect trade union during industrial action process the howl of derision from opposition members show that the labour government be do the right thing this be good bill that should mark the start of process hope that my hon friend the minister who have do fantastic job understand that we be all just try to strengthen the bill through our amendment while we accept those howl of derision from the conservatives it be worth remind the house and indeed the country that the turquoise trumpian tories in reform have also oppose the bill at every step of the way perhaps it be because as company for that be what they be they want to ensure that their worker such as the hon member for great yarmouth rupert lowe be limit in how they can address workplace bully by the owner or perhaps it be because while they masquerade as party for the ordinary man and woman of this country in reality they be simply margaret thatcher tribute act with sprinkle of bigotry determine to advance her destructive agenda at all cost regardless of its impact on work people across our country rise order more than member wish to speak do not want to set time limit but if member can police themselves and keep their speech to just shy of eight minute everyone will definitely get in wish to develop some of the detailed and eloquent argument advance by my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith and to speak in particular about the amendment relate to part of the bill and the trade union movement before he leave let thank the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne for his very measure comment enjoy his referral back to the industrial relation of the although should point out that we have move on little since then will say more about that shortly also think that he simplify the opposition position we be not here to bash the union we support progressive modern trade union movement in which the balance be strike correctly between employer and employee union should not and do not run business but they be an important part of our industrial relation landscape there can be little doubt that this be unfortunately bill draft by the few to the detriment of the many and the numerous provision that will largely abolish the trade union act threaten to drag the country back to the dark day of the the very enjoyable speech that we have just hear from the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery perhaps illustrate that return to the be pleased to see number of his friend from the rebellious left on the government benches and look forward to hear their comment in due course the trade union act be bring in by the last conservative government to reflect the modern british economy and workplace it move the trade union movement into the century and ensure that hard work people be not disrupt by little support strike action in my constituency of congleton we have be blight by approximately seven year of strike action by northern do the hon gentleman agree that the key to modern industrial relation be to have good industrial relation not to pull apart bills that make thing well think the good solution would be proper privatisation of our railway include nationalise service like northern which be constantly on strike would use hull train which serve lot of constituent in my area and be very rarely if at all on strike as an example of an excellent private open access firm rail franchise that have be nationalise have far great problem with strike action than those that have not wish to go back briefly to the the height of the trade union movement the number of trade union member peak in at around million since then the number have decline considerably to around million the majority of whom be in the public sector it be often for good reason that people in the public sector be member of union but it mean that the landscape have change we have move away from be society and an economy of heavy industry and large manufacturing and of town that may have be build on one or two industry or one or two factory where everybody in that area be largely employ either directly or indirectly in those place that be where the trade union movement be require where it be strong and where it be need the modern workplace be very different we be now largely service base economy and the relationship between employer and employee be much more modern and much more flexible we have hear about the need for the traditional trade union movement and about return to secondary action fly picket and so forth clearly there be no place at all for that in the uk now the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery suggest that we should have return to secondary action what be my hon friend view do not want to speak on behalf of the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery but he make his view very clear be sure that we will hear more in that tone as we go through the afternoon it be really important that the bill do not take we back to place where growth be stifle the government talk about the importance of growth but take together this bill and the budget will cause we very severe problem because there be very little point in have extra trade union representation if unemployment be go through the roof those who be unemployed will not be represent my big fear be that overall this bill be an act of economic sabotage it protect the dinosaur from extinction it damage the uk economy and it ensure only that trade union donation continue to flow into the labour party my membership of unison and of the national executive of unison prior to my election be well document draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests what people on this side of the house probably do not know be that be also an associate member of the chartered institute of personnel and development the professional body for the people profession and have spend over year as manager and an employer have therefore spend most of my career work with people manage people and employ people have ensure that staffing level be maintain on the hour that people be contract and available to work and have manage their flexibility without have to resort to bank or agency staff every week however as trade union rep have prepare for and work on consultative ballot statutory industrial action ballot and oh yeah political fund ballot have do the hard yard have walk the ward at in the morning to speak to the night shift and have go out to remote workplace to engage with people but have also meet management to agree on what essential level of service be pay tribute to all of those who have work on this bill to get it to the place where it be today and welcome its come back to the house believe in fair work relationship between the employer and the worker that be base on equality fair day pay for fair day work and the right of an individual to withdraw their labour should worker collectively vote to do so we discuss yesterday what healthy employment relationship look like and it be about more than just pay it be about how people be treat at work and it be about ensure that work pay and that people have not only job but guarantee hour if that be what they want if someone want to work full time they should not have to work two or maybe three contract with the same employer to make up those hour or to work the same excess hour every week for month and month until they want to take an annual leave day when they lose their entitlement to that today amendment focus on two main aspect of the bill the right of trade union to organise in way that we recognise in the century and how this vital piece of legislation be enforce as we have be remind the world of work have change fundamentally in the last year and so have the world of trade union listen very carefully and with great respect to the hon member for st albans daisy cooper who speak of the combative and adversarial nature of trade union but that be not the world that recognise be grateful to the hon member for address some of my concern and look forward to hear what she say just to be clear be talk about what can be combative work environment for employee and employer and say there be miss opportunity to create more collaborative environment be not necessarily accuse the trade union but working environment can be combative thank you very much for your intervention have year experience of work in partnership arrangement and staff side trade union have be the agree and recognise body for staff in the nhs it be natural to sit down together and say these be our issue how do we resolve they it be lot more financially advantageous if we do not end up in situation that be adversarial electronic balloting have long be common practice but not for statutory trade union ballot this be not just about public vote on strictly come dancing or celebrity get out of here notice that the conservative leadership election in make great use of electronic balloting it be absolutely time for trade union ballot to be bring into line with society so welcome the measure in the bill to widen the method of voting in industrial action ballot while be on the subject of balloting let also say that support the extension of the period of time before re ballot take place to extend the mandate for strike action the ultimate aim of any form of industrial action be for dispute to be resolve by all of the party involve ideally before any action be take before labour be withdraw before individual lose their money and before the public be affect the role of the government should be to ensure that intransigent party get round the table and talk in order to resolve any issue conservative members have remind we that when face with that opportunity they do exactly the opposite they introduce the strikes minimum service levels act piece of legislation that be so useless that it have stop precisely zero strike it be use precisely zero time and be rightly be repeal as part of this legislation what conservative member do not recognise be that trade union and trade union member do not take action lightly do wonder what the shadow minister the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith be think because he have obviously never talk to trade union member people know their right they want to belong to thing and they want to be involve people collectively make such decision and they individually make decision about their subscription and by golly they know because they have tell these provision have not be bring in with business kick and scream most business that work well with people know exactly what be go on in the interest of time let say that completely endorse this bill and every aspect of its enforcement everybody know somebody who be be exploit at work the bill will prevent that happen it be time to rebalance the employment relationship miss murray you use the term you if it make it easy you can speak focus on the chair and that way you will not make such mistake say thank you mean thank and it get very complicated for hansard so it be good not to do that just focus on the chair and that will help need to make correction should draw member attention to printing error in government new clause as it appear in the print version of today amendment paper the closing word at the end of subsection should read the secretary of state may withdraw it by give notice of withdrawal to the person correct version of the amendment paper be available online this be chaotic mess of bill cobble together in day to satisfy press release we have the unedifye spectacle of an amendment paper that be page long as the government try to correct their many mistake the main thing that want to address in my short speech be the idea that labour be beholden to the union that be often suggest but let we just look at the fact because we need to put this to bed between and labour receive only from the union and in this parliament more than labour mp have be pay directly by the union the ministers in the department for business and trade have collectively receive about from union what be the union pay for whatever it be they have be handsomely repay in the drafting of this bill to make it easy for labour members who be all here to hear my point of order perhaps they could put their hand up if they have not receive any cash from the union oh dear oh dear clause suggest that there should be requirement to contribute to political fund when people join union it change the rule on how union member should donate and how they should contribute political fund to the labour party clause change subscription from an opt in to an opt out that raise the question why do we need this clause what be the problem that the labour party be try to fix be million just not enough this clause encourage union when sign up member to take advantage of their distraction because member will not be focus on that and they will fall into what be in effect subscription trap in other circumstance the labour party do not think that subscription trap be very good idea in fact the government send out press release on november entitle new measure unveil to crack down on subscription trap that sound good so far it say consultation launch on measure to crack down on subscription trap and well protect shopper unwanted subscription cost family per month per subscription and billion year in total it go on new proposal to crack down on subscription trap have be unveil today subscription trap be instance where consumer be frequently mislead into sign up for subscription it come as new figure reveal consumer be spend billion of pound each year on unwanted subscription due to unclear term and condition and complicated cancellation route the business secretary say our mission be to put more money back into people pocket and improve living standard across this country tackle subscription trap that rip people earning away be an important part of that clause fly in the face of that press release do the hon gentleman agree that there be massive difference between major corporation want to take money out of people bank account every month and trade union want to represent people as effectively as possible in the workplace do not accept that difference take advantage of people inattention as this clause expressly set out to do be take advantage of people for financial gain the difference be that the people who gain in this instance be labour members that beg the question why have they draft this clause and why shamingly will they vote for it later will the hon gentleman give way will in moment here we have it clause of direct financial interest to labour members we have so far have two speaker who have both receive very significant sum from the union to which they do not directly refer the first be the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery who have receive from the union accord to his entry in the register of members financial interests the second be the hon member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray who have receive directly from the union this be germane to this debate as have be say already in this debate trade union donation have be declare but donation from employer who have direct private interest in particular sector that we have debate in this place have not be declare if any of the hon member colleague have not draw attention to such an interest will he encourage they to do so do he agree with we on the labour benches that they be wrong not to make such declaration order there be two point of order on declaration early and think make the situation quite clear just wish to let mr mayhew know that if he be refer to member directly with any form of criticism he be mean to give they prior warning so he should be mindful of that for what come next in his speech the intervention from the hon member for birmingham northfield laurence turner be classic distraction technique this bill address the union and union membership and clause move money from unsuspecting union joiner directly to the labour party there be no other explanation for the clause will the hon gentleman give way will the hon gentleman give way will give way to the hon lady and then will make some progress the hon member be work incredibly hard to try to make case for vested interest in relation to this bill those vested interest be in the work people of this country nevertheless appreciate his effort and he certainly have earn his afternoon snack today this precede my time in this chamber and my hon friend may be able to help but be he as vociferous during the pandemic time of national crisis when close relationship with senior government figure secure contract that produce no personal protective equipment when the country be in such desperate need do not follow that so will just have to move on the hon member for clwyd east becky gittins have just make point suggest that work people be not impact by the behaviour of trade union but do my hon friend agree that it be the work people of this country who be hammer the most when labour members paymaster the trade union go on strike completely agree with my hon friend can not add any more to that he have hit the nail on the head support amendment in the name of the opposition which would remove clause at the moment this be circular bill of self interest labour member get money from the union the bill increase union power and that clause increase the amount of money from the union the clause be brazen and sham and it should be remove draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and to my proud trade union membership be member of the communication workers union and the gmb for too long work family in paisley and renfrewshire south have be let down by outdated employment law unfit for modern economy leave too many worker trap in insecure low pay job when the conservatives crash the economy who bear the brunt not they people in insecure low pay role be leave to bear the brunt of their economic incompetence everyone watch this debate will remember on the previous government watch the dread of open their bill and mortgage statement and see just how much their cost have skyrocket they will remember be at the supermarket check out and be force to put essential back on the shelf because they cost much more than they do the week before some parent will remember sit at the dinner table and watch their child eat while they go without for too long too many people in our community have go to work not to build well future but simply to scrape by they work very hard for the poverty they then experience as former trade union negotiator spend more than year of my work life stand up for people in low pay job as former head of local government for unison scotland be proud to represent the bin collector the carer and the school support worker all of whom be the bedrock and the backbone of our local community and on whom we rely so much during the covid pandemic when their bill go up they turn to their trade union ask we to negotiate for nothing more than fair day wage for fair day work yet under law introduce by the previous government fight for those worker too often feel like fight with one arm tie behind our back within legal framework that allow bad business to ignore trade union and the voice of worker allow business to flood bargaining group to prevent trade union recognition and weaken worker voice and allow employer to impose minimum service level an attack on worker right that do nothing to address the reason why our public service be struggle let be clear labour member have no problem with business the problem be that the previous government allow exploitation to thrive most business want to do right by their worker they know that fair pay and good condition lead to happy worker and more productive economy they know that treat worker fairly be not burden but benefit that be why the bill be so important it fix these issue it expand statutory sick pay to help people improve their health and wellbeing and get back to work it improve industrial relation and will give worker strong protection with regard to their holiday pay it introduce new fair work agency to enforce those new right because frankly there be no point in have those right unless they can be enforce what the conservative party just do not get be that be pro worker be be pro business and pro growth when they introduce burdensome red tape on trade union they introduce burdensome red tape on business and their ability to engage in the bargaining and negotiation process that settle dispute quickly negotiation with trade union mean few dispute few day lose to industrial action and great economic stability at the general election labour pledge to make the big upgrade to worker right in generation restore dignity to work and put more money in family pocket today we take another step towards deliver that promise want we to be more ambitious we on the labour benches be always ambitious and draw the minister attention to the potential issue in the bill regard the low earning limit for statutory sick pay hope that can be resolve when the bill go to the other place finish with quote from paisley own robert tannahill through summer and winter so dreary cheerily on the farm nor ever once grow weary for love give my labour its charm good work be good for people it provide dignity work should provide security not uncertainty it should be source of pride not precarity it should be means of build good life it should not just allow people to scrape by that be what the bill stand for and what this labour government stand for and will fight for and be proud to support it would like to address the hon lady point that be pro worker be pro business we conservative members believe that the only problem be that this legislation be not pro worker or pro business it will drive up unemployment and the regulation of business the worker whom she purport to represent and support be exactly the people who will suffer as result of this legislation we conservative members absolutely get that will talk in favour of amendment on the political fund new clause and amendment and and will refer to access to the workplace refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests not least because work in small family business and retain an interest in the family business also before be elect be president of the greater birmingham chamber of commerce one of the large and old chamber of commerce in the country and the world represent thousand of small business let we be in no doubt this be terrible piece of legislation it be love letter from the labour government to trade union and it will lead to trail of socialist carnage and destruction that will leave the country reel for many many year to come it harm business undermine employment will drive up unemployment and will do nothing to increase growth or investment in the united kingdom the purport aim of the government in fact the government original impact assessment when the bill be first introduce talk about the cost to business be about billion reach almost billion we be yet to see the impact of the new amendment further move to more socialist version of the bill and their cost to business the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne who be friend and neighbour talk about the modern workplace agree that the workplace have change since the and even the but the bill will take the workplace back to the it fail to achieve balance between work people and business and relationship between trade union and business in fact it go way way down the line in favour trade union and it make it much hard for people to run business when be president of the chamber of commerce be perfectly fine with trade union and have good relationship with they have friend who join trade union even though they be not in unionised workplace encourage it they need representation and think it be good thing to do have no problem with trade union relationship in the modern workplace but balance must be achieve comment be make about economic unit economic unit be the business that create economic growth of course worker be really important my employee be really important to because my business could not run without they the majority of business owner recognise that conservative members recognise that there be symbiotic relationship between the people who run business and the employee who work in they those individual run business be driver of economic change they be innovator who come up with the idea they be the risk taker who turn profit which pay the taxis that fund our public service unfortunately the bill do not recognise any of that in fact business be anxious and be worried about what it be introduce no they be not they be absolutely be the deputy prime minister when challenge to name business that support the bill could not do so interruption be sure the hon member will have an opportunity to speak on the matter in his own way do my hon friend agree that the bill be also badly draft even if member support the content it be badly draft bill that be bring before the house far too quickly such huge bill of this nature should have have time it be hardly surprising that the government be table so many amendment because they be still write it could not have make the point well the number of amendment and the cost and regulatory burden be place on business large medium and small have worry many business not just in my constituency but across the country this will do immense harm and it will take long time to fix the mess that have be create there be member sit on the government benches would my hon friend like to issue an open invitation to they to name single small business that have be in touch to say that it support this legislation be more than happy to extend that invitation madam deputy speaker may get annoy with if take intervention although do not see anyone jump to their foot so we will take that for what it be there be also anxiety about the clause on access to the workplace the government have now go far and talk about digital access this be huge burden to put on small business and it be shameful of the government wilfully and blindly to ignore their concern labour members will have to answer many question from business in their community those same business contribute to the treasury coffer and pay for the public service that labour members champion this will be really important and the burden will of course increase before and after the election and during the passage of this legislation labour have say time and again that it be listen to business clearly that be not the case business continue to feel that they have be lead up the garden path by this damaging labour government we in labour have listen to business ann francke of the chartered management institute have go on record as say the employment rights bill represent significant step forward in improve condition for the uk workforce the hon lady should speak to the deputy prime minister who fail to name single supportive business when challenge to do so in the short time have leave will make couple of quick point labour member keep say that the bill will lead to few strike it will not it make it easy to strike in fact the transport secretary today say that strike will be necessary in the area cover by her portfolio the bill will make it easy to strike not hard interruption labour member be exercise be sure that they will get chance to comment the country be at risk of be turn into style strike country this bill should be wake up call for all work people and business that will be undermine as we have hear from member from across the house only the conservatives will stand up for business have question for all labour members people ask what this labour government stand for they undermine business and work people so that be legitimate question fail to see who other than trade union the labour party now stand for when people ask what we conservative stand for margaret thatcher have very good answer she say that the labour the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter who speak before read out quote think should do so as well margaret thatcher say the labour party believe in turn worker against owner we believe in turn worker into owner proudly draw attention to my membership of the unite union and my declaration in the register of members financial interests and thank my friend at the gmb and aslef for their support of my election campaign be in this place to stand up for work people and that be what will do the good protection anyone can have at work be the support of their workmate organise together in union and bargaining with management sit down with they as equal at the table and make sure that the business grow and thrive and that everyone take home fair wage this bill and the government amendment will make it easy for work people to choose their union be represent by their union and get all the benefit of be in recognised union so that we have an economy where well term and condition at work go hand in hand with the growth that we need let we be clear this bill support growth it could add billion to the economy through improvement to employee wellbeing reduce stress improve national minimum wage compliance reduce workplace conflict and increase labour market participation that be the type of growth that we want invite the hon lady to acknowledge the billion cost to business that the government own analysis say will be cause by the bill do acknowledge that every single of which will go into the pocket of work person in improve right and high wage alongside billion of increase productivity reduce stress well employee wellbee and reduce conflict in the workplace on the amendment will start with access to workplace which be the key to get more worker into union strongly welcome provision to give union the right to access workplace for meeting represent organise recruiting and collective bargaining be glad the government amend the rule to ensure they cover digital as well as physical access and be glad to see the central arbitration committee oversight and penalty when employer do not comply as be sometimes the case once union have establish membership in workplace it will want to seek recognition most employer do not have to be force to recognise union it be just what they do as responsible employer but where employer refuse statutory recognition can be trigger until now that process have be absolutely mad and totally dysfunctional and the card be stack against the work people and their union at every turn the bad example of this in recent year be at in coventry where company dedicate to keep union out of its warehouse bring its us style industrial relation to the uk and take on its own worker who want no more and no less than for management to have to sit down and negotiate with their union the gmb amazon be billion company in the uk yet its sale be grow three time high than its frontline worker wage and it have have ambulance call out in just five year in coventry be not safe workplace with fulfilment centre worker get injure be ask to pick up too much to load from the back of vehicle on their own and to lift heavy weight above their head those worker at that amazon plant be force to take day of industrial action over poverty pay at the select committee the company badly brief evasive executive could not bring themselves to acknowledge that recognise the gmb be modest request something company would have accept without question but not amazon at the select committee the gmb organiser amanda gearing tell we that amazon flood the bargaining unit there be worker when the gmb first seek statutory recognition but strangely just day after that application go in the number go up to amanda tell we how amazon delay the access agreement day to agree access to the workplace chance for the company to swamp the worker with anti union propaganda all the screen in the warehouse and the app use for work allocation be anti union threaten to close the site if worker unionise when the access scheme be finally agree the gmb get tiny number of screen and one minute session with each worker while amazon have five one hour session and screen everywhere it induce gmb member to leave the union and in every way impede access pay tribute to the gmb leader at amazon in coventry ceferina floresca garfield hylton paramanathan pradeep and mohammednur mohammed hero all of they stand up to huge intimidation and under huge pressure they run brilliant campaign but the deck be stack against they and they lose the ballot by heartbreaking vote the gmb general secretary my friend gary smith be clear if the legislation we be debate today have be in place the gmb member at amazon would have win their fight the hon lady be fearsome campaigner on the business and trade committee she talk about intimidation and paint lovely picture of union work actively for their worker but how can we square that with the version of intimidation that the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery seem to be refer to with the return of fly picket before the hon lady respond she will no doubt realise that she be close to eight minute know she will want to speak for little while but not too much long thank you madam deputy speaker thank my fellow member of the business and trade committee for his intervention as he will have see from the amendment paper the government be not propose the return of secondary picketing new schedule will give union great protection from unfair practice during recognition process and make win it more likely wish that ministers have go the whole hog and delete the three year lockout perhaps there will be an opportunity to take that forward in conclusion as whole this package of modern industrial relation will lead to more sit roundtable sort out issue few picket line few strike more productive relationship more long termism across our industrial base well job high wage high skill and high productivity that be why the change in this bill to both collective right and individual right be so crucial and so oppose by the tories and the absent reform party this be the type of growth that my party stand for the type of growth where proceed be share by all it be time to make work pay it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance she be such compelling advocate that be tempt to go on strike myself do sense certain amount of antipathy between the two side of the house so before come on to make fair point in support of amendment want to prepare the ground by do two thing first want to try to convince labour members that they miss an opportunity because be at heart rabble rouse potential motivator of people when about three christmas ago the ambulance driver go on strike it irk that the soldier who be go to stand in for they at no notice would have their christmas ruin so start campaign to try to get they an additional for every day they stand in for the ambulance driver this plan be the chancellor would have love this net positive to the treasury of course the department that employ the ambulance driver and the arm length body do not pay they on strike day and the pay differential between they and the bung to the soldier mean that the government still save money manage to get the sun on board and get letter into the paper and do bit of television be the hon gentleman not ashame that under his government hard work ambulance driver feel they have to go on strike think the hon lady have slightly miss the point of what be say read the body language of member on the government benches think they all want to hear how this story end up it do help that the then secretary of state for defence be friend of mine with whom serve in the scots guards we do get the bung for all the service personnel who stand in regardless of the fact interestingly that all the general air marshal and admiral be against it as be all the official there you go very much have the same value at heart secondly to win over the other side of the house to the very fair point will come on to make let pay tribute to the remark of the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne in respect of union membership that he want people to make fair choice one way or the other note that the hon member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray also refer to fair work want to come back to that theme of fairness in address amendment the bill be to put it politely something of cat cradle of clause so will briefly remind the house that the bill seek to place on employer an obligation to give their worker write statement that they have the right to join union and if they do join to contribute to the political fund amendment would simply inject bit of balance into the legislation by require trade union to notify their member annually that they have right to opt out of the political fund and to obtain an annual opt in from their member this all put in mind of november when mrs thatcher be about to visit poland at prime minister question just prior to her go an opposition member stand up and ask whether she would raise with lech wałęsa the right to join trade union there may be some member present who be there will not be so ungallant as to ask roar go up from the labour benches and the redoubtable mrs thatcher reply that she would raise with the poles the right to join trade union but that she would also raise the right not to be member the bill seek to whack the pendulum pretty hard in favour of union power our amendment would bring it back into balance somewhat we all know someone after all who have fall prey to one of those charity mugger who stop people in the street and try to sign they up to whichever charity they be be pay by that day have know people who have do that job and it be not an easy one similarly any member of this house who stand in precinct and try to sell their political brand and get people to sign up will attest to that completely sometimes the charity collector be successful and the all important direct debit detail be extract in fact remember hear number of labour members rail against this practice in the previous parliament amendment would remind worker that they still have an off ramp if they want one they still have agency and they still have freedom of choice we have hear member after member stand up over the past two day of debate and declare in some case sheepishly in some case more proudly the money they receive from the trade union this be only right and proper the public can make up their own mind as to whether this money have colour the judgment of labour members or whether it be simply support from an organisation that share their value but to turn down amendment would in my view be dreadful look this be totally measure balance amendment and if labour members vote against it the public would be right to conclude that the government be be motivate not by sense of equality fairness and justice but instead by something else urge hon member to vote for amendment and to give power to the people it be pleasure to be call to speak for second time on report proudly refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as member of unite the union much have be say about trade union and strike action as if the only purpose of trade union be to get worker out on strike it be mischaracterisation of union as be so eloquently describe by my hon friend the member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance it be also mischaracterisation of corporate britain to think that everyone be exploitative and abusive the majority of company in our country adhere to environmental social and governance principle and they make that commitment they want to demonstrate that they be responsible people they want that for their investor and for long term sustained investment so we have to draw back on those view and step away from the disdain and the contempt for work people and for trade union which be not helpful shall now move on to the substantive issue on government amendment wish to express my support for the strengthening of the role of the fair work agency enforce the decision on pay by the new negotiating body for social care adult social care be the sector uppermost in our thinking when consider the concept of fair pay agreement negotiate through sectoral collective bargaining as express in the new deal for work people note during the bill committee stage that the tuc general secretary paul nowak say body as disparate as the international monetary fund and the oecd have talk about the benefit of union and collective bargaining in modern economy benefit in term of improve productivity and business performance but also benefit for worker in term of increase pay official report employment rights public bill committee november the tuc have say we would like the bill to include power to extend fair pay agreement to other sector wholeheartedly agree with that but fpa of themselves do not remedy the broad need for much great sectoral collective bargaining unite the union have say that we would like to see further measure in the bill to extend collective report employment rights public bill committee november the general secretary of the national union of rail maritime and transport workers say that we would like it very straightforward that there be go to be provision an amendment for sectoral collective bargaining official report employment rights public bill committee november to ensure that the government can establish new negotiating body support fair pay agreement elsewhere in the economy have table new clause good starting point for the government to demonstrate the benefit of sectoral collective bargaining would be in the civil service and hope that the plan to modernise the civil service will end the inefficient situation of hundred of separate pay bargaining unit and negotiation each year wish now to consider private sector contracting the deputy prime minister and the chancellor be among those who have commit to the big wave of insource in generation and look forward to the national procurement policy set that out in the meantime we have see picket line at government departments for month as iss and ocs security fail to meet with representative of the public and commercial services union to resolve pay and condition dispute under my new clause the secretary of state would have duty to ensure that any government department contract or similar public contract recognise an independent trade union for the purpose of collective bargaining hope the government will be address this issue outwith the bill in the near future with regard to the right of access number of new government amendment clarify the process relate to access include the right to communicate with worker include digital communication but remain concerned that the process create complicated framework that risk employer slow the process rather than provide for effective union access and that the propose model of financial penalty do not provide any remedy for the union remain of the opinion that union should always have simple right of access to their member my new clause set out how an official of an independent trade union shall have right to enter premise meet represent recruit or organise worker and facilitate collective bargaining be clear that such access require prior notification in writing set out the purpose of meeting and which employee would join such meeting fear the process set out may not work effectively and hope the government will be open to further simplification in the future on recognition note that the government new schedule update the original clause with additional and welcome provision on union recognition process include prevent an employer inflate the bargaining unit with transfer employee la amazon where worker ascribe to that bargaining unit have no connection with it whatsoever this be to prevent employer reach recognition agreement with non independent union to prevent recognition with an independent one the government have be absolutely right to close off the sweetheart deal arrangement more can be do regard recognition however which be why have table amendment which seek to reduce the need for ballot and ensure that the central arbitration committee grant automatic recognition in certain circumstance or simple majority of those vote in other circumstance have also seek to lengthen the period for make complaint about unfair practice in connection with the ballot from one to working day know the government have shift that from one to five but that be as many union and the tuc have set out and to remove the three year barrier to union that have lose an application for recognition replace three year with three month it be unjust particularly give the anti union measure deploy that the gmb can not quickly pursue recognition process at amazon coventry warehouse where the union lose as we previously hear by just vote it be unjust that they should be push out for such long period and hope the government will remain alive to the need to update that in conclusion be pleased to have be afford the opportunity to speak for second time on report we have in this employment rights bill momentous uplift in worker right and protection which address the balance that have swing far too far in the opposite direction however the appetite remain for yet further improvement commend the government for their work in bring forward the legislation which wholeheartedly support look forward to work together far on the journey to deliver well pay secure and unionised employment although have broadly welcome the bill as it have progress through the house have caveate that by state that the labour government should be bold and must go far in future for the right and protection to become entrenched rather than roll back indeed on second reading quote the scottish trades union congress general secretary roz foyer who summarise the bill by say the employment rights bill be the terminus it the first stop this can be the foundation on which we can build agree the hon member may not have have chance to look at the government website and encounter the document entitle next step to make work pay which set out programme of continue work to improve right at work and parental leave and the review of employment status to come be sure he will be glad to hear that no have not have the chance to look at the government website but thank the hon member for raise that as have broadly say support the bill but there be reason why be contribute to the debate not least because of lack of devolution to the scottish parliament which will come to shortly on second reading the shadow secretary of state for housing communities and local government the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake make it explicitly clear that the foundation will not be build upon in the long term as future conservative government would simply repeal protection he declare that many of the measure will be bring in through secondary legislation therefore make it easy for future government to reverse some of the catastrophic change official report october vol employment right for worker in scotland can not be dependent on the merry go round of westminster politic they have see their right attack and diminish by year of conservative governments and where the bill reverse some of the bad excess of those government policy that must be protect and strengthen in the long term westminster can not guarantee that for the people in scotland so have table new clause which would amend the scotland act to devolve employment and industrial relation to the scottish parliament back in all unionist party include the labour party promise maximum devolution for scotland as display on the front page of national newspaper day before the independence referendum in which scotland vote no this labour government have fail to devolve single power to holyrood since come to power in july not single one despite the scottish parliament vote for employment right to be devolve in november the stuc call on the uk government to end the excuse and devolve power over taxation migration and importantly employment law from westminster to holyrood moreover scottish labour election manifesto state we support further devolution of power to holyrood include borrowing and employment right here be question for scottish labour mps will they respect the wish of the scottish parliament indicate dissent the hon member shake her head but be speak to scottish labour mps care about the people of scotland care about the people of scotland and what they say will scottish labour mps listen to trade union and deliver on the promise make by their party by support the new clause or will they continue to follow instruction hand to they from no silence think so they be too scared to stand up for the people of scotland the hon gentleman say that he be big supporter of worker right would he like to comment on the fact that for every year of the last nine year that be lead negotiator for local government worker in scotland they have to have consultative ballot for industrial action just to get decent pay rise out of the scottish government do that really mean stand up for worker in scotland think be ask question of the scottish labour mp only to be ask another question the hon lady will be well aware that the scottish government have work collectively with both union and other body to ensure that the living wage in scotland be high than in any other part of the uk remind she that it be scottish labour in november that vote with the snp for employment right to be evolve through the scottish parliament throughout its existence when power be devolve to the scottish parliament decision be take in the interest of the people of scotland and outcome improve publicly own rail and water high per head education and health spend free prescription free tuition more humane welfare system and progressive taxation system fair work practice be be deliver already by the snp scottish government such as support collective bargaining achieve real living wage employer status and close the gender pay gap fast than anywhere in the rest of the uk do the hon member agree that it be an absolute failure of collective bargaining for the scottish government to have walk away from the commitment they make in deal with health service union two year ago on the reduction of the work week they be fail to go through with reduce the work week by half an hour as of april listen to the hon member with interest but suggest that she have that debate in the scottish parliament after all we be talk about the devolution of power here in the uk parliament framework for collective bargaining in the adult care sector have be develop by the scottish care union unison the gmb and unite along with the scottish government and care provider with scottish social care joint council propose the scottish care union have intimate that the constitution composition remit and function of the scottish social care joint council be preferable and should assume the role of the adult social care negotiating body for england scotland already have year history of joint commitment to fair work whereas england be only embark on that journey furthermore there be need to extend sectoral bargaining to all sector of the economy not just adult social care measure such as create single status of worker for all but the genuinely self employ strengthen protection for those with unfair contract and increase the minimum wage to at least the national living wage and then in line with inflation be all miss from the bill the snp scottish government would support those measure if employment law be devolve and they would be deliver if this government respect the vote of the scottish parliament and the scottish labour manifesto just as the bill should be the first stop rather than the terminus devolution be process not an event not only have devolution move at glacial pace but we live in the world most asymmetrical political union where each nation have differ devolve power why be it that employment law be devolve in northern ireland but not in scotland want to see employment right strengthen continually rather than in cycle of piecemeal progress when labour be in power only to be reverse when the tories next get their turn the gain for worker right in the bill must therefore be protect that be why the snp remain committed to advocate for at minimum the urgent devolution of employment power that be the good way short of independence of protect worker right in scotland too refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests have be proud member of unite the union for over year although many member may find that hard to believe give my youthful look member since you be five year old absolutely welcome the measure in the bill which know will make real difference to the life of work people and their family in derby and across the uk will focus on how the bill will through government amendment transform employee access to trade union empower more employee to act as collective so that they can secure well pay and condition when speak to business leader in small and large employer they all say that their big asset be their people the conservatives can harp on about trade union as much as they want but in practice the good solution be for employer to work with employee and trade union rep to create the good working condition for business and individual to succeed know about the importance of union membership from first hand experience when leave school at the age of and begin work as an engineering apprentice join the union on day two know how important that would be in support and my colleague at work much later on when campaign to save alstom in derby last year see how hard unite and other trade union fight to secure job at the litchurch lane facility they stand up for work people in our local community when it matter most however employee can not access the benefit that union membership can bring if they do not know about the support offer by trade union in the first place congratulate my hon friend on his youthful appearance do he agree that just as business be about the employee trade union be about their membership and give individual member their right my hon friend be absolutely right this be about individual member come together to do what be right for themselves for their trade union and for the company and business that they work for welcome the bill introduction of right of access for union to meet with worker government amendment expand union access agreement so that union can communicate with worker digitally as well as by enter the workplace urge meaningful implementation of those digital access right to enable direct conversation between union and worker as would take place during in person meeting in the workplace when we work together we get more do it be important that worker have access to union representative and know how join union can support they in the workplace welcome the measure in the bill to expand that access which will far strengthen the right of work people in derby and beyond there be business register in my constituency of south northamptonshire of those specifically be small business this bill among many of the government policy be calamity for those small business not only be many of they rural mean that they will be affect by the family farm tax and now by the removal of the sustainable farming incentive but as the chair of the federation of small businesses have say these small and medium sized enterprise will struggle to adapt to the major change that the bill make to employment law first it be the government job tax then it be their cut to rate relief for hospitality business and now they be smother sme with red tape analysis publish by the department for business and trade say that this will impose cost on business in the low billion of pound per year but that be not money that many of my small business can afford right now this be why the opposition have call for small business to be exempt from the part of the bill that would heap unsustainable cost on they why do the government seem to hate small business so much perhaps it be because the majority of the cabinet have spend their career in the public sector and have zero understanding of what life be like for the many entrepreneur with sme across the uk include in my constituency we learn this week that for the first time since record begin in the number of company register at companies house have fall growth forecast have be downgrade and the number of vacancy have decline all this be result of the choice the government have make and continue to make in this bill with all of this the uk risk become globally uncompetitive economy particularly when other country such as the united states be slash regulation and unleash their business to grow their economy the opposition have table new clause for exactly this reason it would ensure that when the secretary of state make regulation under part of the bill he have to have regard to growth in the medium to long term join the shadow minister my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith in call on the government to support new clause and to ensure that growth happen our economy be already struggle under the weight of labour tax rise why be the government oppose our effort to ensure that they consider how burdensome regulation might impact on business lot of people outside this place might feel that the answer to that question be that the trade union have fund labour the hon member for derby south baggy shanker who be talk from sedentary position receive more than from two union in the late year of declaration and do not think it appropriate in this debate even to mention that number which may well have influence his thinking and lead to the dire outcome that my hon friend be explain to the house my right hon friend make powerful point and think all labour members must reflect on this because we need the public to understand truly why this legislation be go through that the government have see fit to table of their own amendment at this stage alone be indicative of how uneasy they must feel about the bill we be even tell by the medium that the treasury have warn the deputy prime minister and the secretary of state about the consequence for the economy of enact these law yet they seem to have see fit to plough they through anyway as per usual labour be pay lip service to growth while stick true to form with their socialist ideology be not bear in the but it appear that be go to live through the equivalent in the year ahead as labour play abba hit money money money for its trade union paymaster refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be proud trade unionist and member of unite the union have be support from across the labour movement with the clean money in politic which do not think conservative members can say about themselves for over year swedish tesla worker have be on strike demand the basic right to collective bargaining their struggle have inspire solidarity across industry postal worker painter electrician cleaner and dock worker have all launch secondary action in support denmark large trade union transport have also join the fight prevent danish dock worker and driver from handle tesla shipment bind for sweden this level of solidarity be possible because swedish trade union be not shackle by restrictive law design to suppress collective action unlike here in the uk the legislative landscape in sweden do not act against the interest of organise labour almost of swedish worker be cover by collective agreement and their labour law ensure that worker have the right to negotiate and defend their condition without undue interference as result swedish trade union be more than match for billionaire like elon musk when tesla refuse to sign collective agreement it be not just tesla worker who fight back the entire trade union movement do that be what real industrial democracy look like and it be powerful reminder of what british worker have be deny for too long by some of the most draconian anti union legislation in the western world while welcome the repeal of the strikes minimum service levels act and much of the trade union act the fact remain that many of the bad thatcher era anti union law be still in place one of the most damaging be section of the trade union and labour relations consolidation act which make secondary action unlawful that ban on sympathy strike isolate worker weaken their bargaining power and prolong dispute all to the benefit of exploitative employer that be why have table new clause to repeal that restriction and return power to work people secondary action build the trade union movement as we know it it help we secure the very right that we all benefit from today but in an era of outsourcing and subcontracting the ban be even more harmful than it be three decade ago under current legislation two worker perform the same job in the same workplace can not take industrial action together if one be directly employ and the other be outsource employer exploit that loophole to divide worker they shift responsibility through complex corporate structure like what we be see at coventry university in my constituency and undermine union action by transfer work or hive off company worker be even prevent from take action against parent company and supplier during dispute in many way secondary action be more essential than ever in the fight for fair pay and condition most european nation include denmark norway sweden belgium and the netherlands allow secondary action in some form even those with restriction such as germany france and spain stop short of impose an outright ban labour new deal for work people commit to repeal anti union law and ensure that the uk industrial action law comply with international obligation include those under the international labour organisation and the european social charter yet as it stand the bill fail to deliver on that promise international body have repeatedly condemn the uk ban on secondary action the european committee of social rights and the ilo criticise the uk for that restriction most recently in after the ferries scandal when crew member be sack via video call and replace with agency worker know that it could get away with its disgraceful action because the law prevent other worker from strike in solidarity also support number of amendment include those table by my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald such as new clause which would define employment status in law to end bogus self employment that be long overdue for too long employer have exploit gap in employment law to deny worker basic right today in our country black and asian worker be disproportionately trap in precarious low pay job on bogus self employment contract and deny statutory sick pay holiday pay and protection from unfair dismissal this two tier system must end every single worker deserve dignity and respect in the workplace and by strengthen the bill with these amendment we would be take step forward towards rebuild the power of the work class urge member across the house to stand on the right side of history and with the worker who keep this country run rise to speak again on the second day of report stage to raise serious concern about the role of the bill in facilitate unprecedented and dangerous access for trade union and the destruction of business especially small business be glad the minister be in his seat because yesterday he be challenge to name small business that support the bill and hour later he still can not that be due not to the assiduity of the minister who be sure be very assiduous but to the simple fact that no small business support the bill will the hon member give way have hardly start there can not possibly be anything that the hon gentleman want to intervene on for just yet but will come to he will the hon member give way will come to the hon gentleman in minute yesterday we hear that labour clearly do not understand business and today we get to what it really do understand how it can support its trade union paymaster government members have give we masterclass in how to support trade union opposition members have mention the when hear government member speak especially the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery john williams score from jurassic park soar in my mind but instead of jeff goldblum be savage by the dinosaur the dinosaur that walk among we today will be savage our economy we know that because the grow influence of the union especially under the bill impose heavy burden on corporation stifle their ability to operate efficiently as new business struggle to adapt to the new regulation which the government very own impact assessment predict will cost billion to implement industry leader have publicly share their fear on point of order madam deputy speaker we have have direction from the chair on this matter and ask for your guidance the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford have just be immensely critical of my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery who have history of stand up to defend his industry and who have the courage to go on strike for month be he give notice that he would be name in this debate in that way thank the hon member but he will be aware that that be not point of order as the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery have speak in the debate it be perfectly in order to refer to the comment that he make return to what industry leader be say they have share their fear about union influence slow down decision making and hinder flexibility make it hard for company to remain competitive in global market the chartered institute of personnel and development survey find that of organisation expect measure in the employment rights bill to increase employment cost place further strain on company that be have to grapple with increase to national insurance contribution and the rise national minimum wage it be also likely that the measure will lead to more strike more disruption and ultimately less productivity the hon member have refer number of time to yesterday proceeding be sad that he be not able to join we in the division lobby in vote against the amendment and in favour of the bill give that of his constituent in farnham and bordon support statutory sick pay for all worker from day one and of his constituent support ban zero hour contract be sorry that be such disappointment to the hon lady but maybe she will get over it the bill be roll back of the most important change that we make when we be in government it be no surprise that trade union have warmly embrace the legislation over amendment have be hastily shoehorn in to satisfy those who line the government pocket perhaps it be purely coincidental that their wish have be grant although one might wonder if the million in donation the labour party have receive since july have something to do with it despite her proud membership of trade union the last labour member to be call to speak the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana do not mention the more than that she receive just in the last year any more than the labour member who speak before she the hon member for derby south baggy shanker mention the plus that he receive if labour members be truly proud of the way that they have be buy and pay for by the trade union perhaps they would be open about how much they have receive my right hon friend make key point the change since yesterday have be interesting yesterday labour members be clear about declare that they be member of trade union but only today have they suddenly realise that they should be declare the amount of money that they be receive directly we hear yesterday from the shadow secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake that the legislation will allow union to bypass current rule such as the rule on opt out of political donation it must be fantastic news to the labour party that it will now receive donation from worker by default while business will face reduce notice period for strike lead to even more disruption and economic damage it be clear to and to the hundred of business that have pull their support for this government that this be not about protect employment right but about consolidate union power let we briefly look at some of the amendment amendment would require trade union to notify their member every year of their right to opt out of the political fund and to obtain an annual opt in that change would ensure that union do not continue to fill labour piggybank and do not lock worker into automatic donation unless they actively opt out which be as much memory test as an admin task unamended clause be not about transparency but about keep the money flow to the political party with the most to gain likewise there be new clause and amendment that would have introduce transparency about the facility provide to trade union official learn representative and equality representative clause and be design to reduce transparency and accountability for union spending allow union official to continue to benefit from facility time without proper scrutiny will my hon friend give way will for the last time do my hon friend agree that there be an interesting contrast in the government approach they be quite happy to put extra burden responsibility and work on business of all size yet when it come to any element of transparency or give member of trade union real choice and understanding of where their money be go they refuse to do that the disparity will put it no strong than that that my right hon friend mention be stark anybody watch these proceeding outside this house will absolutely agree that the government want to put extra burden and regulation on business but when it come to the trade union transparency go out the window why be that happen the answer be simple and clear union have significant influence over this government while the deputy prime minister and her cabinet colleague be push for these change they do not even do what the measure state key figure include the chancellor the foreign secretary and the home secretary be all guilty of hire under term that be odd with the new regulation why would they introduce such bill when they themselves do not comply with it just like the more than labour mp who have take union donation the deputy prime minister have her own interest to consider in her opening remark yesterday she proudly disclose her union membership while conveniently admit to the in union donation that she have take it be clear that union influence be drive this legislation and most likely write the speech of labour members the government claim to be pro growth pro business and pro report october vol will the hon gentleman give way will not because have only minute to go perhaps it be time that the government start listen to the real industry expert those with practical experience in the sector not just the trade union or those within the confine of whitehall the conservatives have table key amendment to support growth in new clause and international competitive duty in new clause and limit on trade union influence on our business drive economy we need to ensure that the government policy do not burden our business stifle innovation or lead to long term economic harm this bill be not just poorly think out but direct threat to the very fabric of our economy and we must challenge it before it cause irreparable damage and crush our already crippled economy declare that be proud member of unison and refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests rise to speak in support of this groundbreake employment rights bill which will deliver pro business and pro worker reform it will establish day one right such as right to parental and bereavement leave for million of worker and crucially will put more money into people pocket people who have have to endure low pay job insecurity and cost of living crisis create by year of tory rule by strengthen protection for the lowest pay worker and prevent exploitative employment practice the bill will give our work people the solid foundation on which to build well quality of life will very briefly comment on couple of topic debate yesterday which be of personal relevance and relevant to my constituency interruption no will skip it do not think would get away with that this bill will give voice to work people by tackle the exclusion of independent union from workplace if anyone have experience management of change process once do almost three week into join new job which be not fun or workplace bullying they will know the value of have union back they union be fab personally thank unison include the incredible trudie for support in my workplace have see the impact on those who have experience issue such as workplace bullying when they have not have the backing of union or union in their workplace and the stress and pressure on they be immense indeed they end up with the choice of either put up with it leave we then have worker turnover or go off sick have know people to go off sick for quite period of time which be of course come at great cost to the company when person join union have see the difference that backing and advocacy make to they and the voice it give they have experience that as normal person who once have proper job who be not union activist but feel the value of union make that comment as an observer the work that union do with management for the worker to provide workplace that be productive and secure benefit company as well it be not in the interest of union for business to fail everyone want productive working environment it would be remiss of however to not acknowledge the concern that many small business owner have raise with in recent month they have be worried about this bill and be grateful to many business that have reach out include and crossroads care also want to thank rachel laver of the chamber of commerce for her excellent engagement and for give voice to local business have engage with they regularly their concern be note but also note comment like that from claire costello chief people and inclusion officer at the co op it our belief that treat employee well key objective of this bill will promote productivity and generate the economic growth this country need that comment have be echo to by local business my business in stoke on trent south have my word that will support they and their worker and so will this labour government by deliver improve productivity and growth be sad that the conservative party which have table block amendment do not want to support the work people of this country this bill comprehensive set of impact assessment show that the bill will have positive impact on growth with vital measure such as those on sick pay boost productivity and growth protect the super rich and rely on the myth of trickle down economic have fail it be time for trickle up economic and empower the work people of this country as have be say many time yesterday and today this bill be deeply flawed the government have ignore the serious concern raise by business leader and independent economist the federation of small businesses have warn that these rush change will lead to job loss and deter employer from hire the institute of directors find that of business leader will be less likely to hire because of the additional red tape impose by the bill and incredibly the government own impact assessment fail to account for the bill real economic consequence simply dismiss they as too hard to calculate our new clause would ensure that any regulation make under part of the bill must consider economic growth and international competitiveness yet labour have refuse to accept even that common sense measure prove that its approach be anti growth at its core prioritise the interest of trade union over economic stability make it hard for business to hire grow and compete it be no surprise that trade union have declare victory as the government have effectively hand they blank cheque at the expense of business and worker alike our amendment seek to restore fairness and balance amendment would require trade union to notify their member annually of their right to opt out of political fund contribution ensure basic transparency and fairness labour have hypocritically oppose this measure despite previously support similar provision during the passage of the digital markets competition and consumers act it call automatic renewal subscription trap it seem that labour only care about consumer choice when it do not impact on its own funding the government claim that remove this requirement be about cut red tape for union while add lot of other red tape in reality the change strip away individual choice and accountability as several of my hon friend have say trade union donate over million to the labour party between and worker should have the right to make an informed choice each year about whether they want to contribute to political cause rather than be automatically sign up without clear consent labour members refusal to support the amendment reveal their true priority protect their own financial interest rather than stand up for transparency and worker right equally troubling be the expansion of trade union access to workplace include digital access under new clause to despite of consultation respondent ask for more information or outright oppose the provision the government be press ahead regardless these change hand union unchecked power allow they to disrupt business without adequate safeguard this bill be not modernisation of employment right it be gift to the trade union at the expense of economic growth job creation and business confidence the government have fail to strike the right balance and we will continue to oppose this legislation the impact assessment state that these measure could have billion impact in addition to the billion impact of the national insurance contribution change do my hon friend agree that what the impact assessment be miss be how much union fund the measure will drive directly to the labour party as result we ought to know how many hundred of thousand or million extra will come to the labour party and to labour member to make they support this growth kill set of measure it be fascinating question and we wait to hear the answer from government members the minister will tell we we hope indeed perhaps the minister will give we the answer it be pleasure to speak on this vital bill as it pass its remain stage draw the house attention to my declaration in the register of members financial interests be proud member of the gmb and community trade union be particularly pleased to speak in today debate because at one of my regular coffee morning on saturday constituent of mine phil tell that need to be do more to promote the benefit of this legislation be not sure that make speech in the house of commons meet phil expectation of promotion but that conversation show how important this legislation will be for work people in the livingston constituency the government have rightly table amendment to the bill to ensure that we deliver reform that be both pro business and pro worker although conservative member have try to make much of the number of government amendment we remember that they be still the party of eff business with their opposition to the bill they show that they be eff worker too what the amendment in fact demonstrate be the commitment of the minister and the government to listen and consult with huge range of stakeholder on these issue deliver the large upgrade in worker right in many decade but in way that do right by business and good employer ensure that they have the condition and environment they need to encourage investment and create job this bill will support the government critical mission for growth by increase productivity and put money back in people pocket it will deliver real life improvement can the hon gentleman set out five way that the bill will improve productivity for business will certainly come on to that but one way be that the bill will improve employment relation in workforce in the past year we have see strike after strike because of the conservatives approach to industrial relation this change will improve productivity the bill will deliver real life improvement that will be feel across britain key amendment that strengthen protection for the lowest pay worker will ensure that all worker be treat with the decency they deserve welcome the vital step that the bill take to extend protection from exploitative zero hour contract to protect the voice of work people and strengthen statutory sick pay as member of the business and trade committee have be able to scrutinise large business that choose to have zero hour contract in place in one evidence session hear from company representative who reveal that employee can have their shift change at hour notice but not receive single penny in compensation the bill be vital in address the challenge of financial planning face by family who be dependent on zero hour contract more than million people on such contract will benefit from the guarantee hour policy crucially the bill will ensure that government work with business and will support employer who endeavour to comply with the law with the government amendment it will also expand and strengthen the power of the fair work agency to bring civil proceeding against non compliant employer at employment tribunal and to issue civil penalty such as fine to employer who breach pay relate right and underpay their staff give that the measure we be debate will give so much more power to the trade union why have the hon gentleman not feel it incumbent on he to declare the thousand of pound that he have receive from trade union in the last year thank the right hon member for highlight that because be proud of the money that receive from union be also proud of the fact that entrepreneur and business people donate to my campaign as well the right hon member neglect to mention that when he bring the subject up because be both pro business and pro worker want to see growth in the economy be proud to receive donation from employer and people who have create wealth in this country and be also proud to receive donation from trade union member in my constituency be the hon member surprise as be that there be so much support on these benches for cap on political donation and great transparency about they we have mention that of course and it be certainly the case would love to see more transparency from the conservative party it be right and proper that we reward the good business that contribute to good employment and sustainable growth and it be right and proper that we take action against rogue employer that do not with this bill the government be also call it quit on the tories scorch earth approach to industrial relation which lead to the bad strike chaos in decade new partnership of co operation between trade union employer and government will ensure that we benefit from more co operation and less disruption north of the border the bill signal the large upgrade of worker right in scotland for decade it mark an end to exploitative zero hour contract and fire and rehire practice it will establish day one right to paternity parental and bereavement leave for million of worker however it will also be beneficial for employer in scotland help to keep people in work and reduce recruitment cost by increase staff retention and level the play field on enforcement it be both pro worker and pro business member of the scottish national party include the hon member for dundee central chris law today have be call for the devolution of employment law for many year but at no point have they explain how beyond the banning of zero hour contract those power would be use to improve worker term and condition to increase productivity and to accelerate economic growth moreover it might be nice if the snp practise what it preach during the rutherglen by election in it choose to use zero hour contract to employ people to deliver leaflet in government the same party have choose to include zero hour contract in their definition of positive destination for school leaver financial insecurity anxiety and stress do not sound like my idea of positive destination the snp say that it want to transform scotland economy for the well to boost wage and productivity and grow key sector but the fact be that scotland have high rate of zero hour contract among people in employment than any other uk nation how be people suppose to plan financially and improve their quality of life when they wake up on monday morning to find out via text message whether this week they will have eight shift two shift or no shift at all the reality be that the scottish government already have the power to introduce change to many worker term and condition through public procurement but they choose not to do so they would always rather blame someone else and further constitutional grievance than use the extensive power that they have to improve the life of ordinary scot that be why the bill be of such paramount importance across the uk acute benefit will be deliver to the people who need they the most and in scotland the bill will right the wrong of the snp laissez faire approach to regulate zero hour contract the tenure of this labour government be still measure in month and not year but this bill be yet another example of their deliver the new direction that the worker business and people of scotland and the wide united kingdom deserve as any sensible people would know change to business regulation need to strike careful balance to not deter both business investment and job creation but be afraid that this bill get the balance wrong labour weakening of variety of trade union law particularly on the threshold for industrial action be recipe for disaster for both the public and business particularly sme as london mp have hear this fairytale from those on the labour benches before because london have too often be paralyse by strike under mayor sadiq khan infamously the london mayor promise our city zero day of strike in but he have comprehensively break that promise in sadiq khan first two term there be more than strike which be almost four time more than the number of strike under his predecessor record that mayor khan label disgrace if strike be disgrace the under mayor khan represent catastrophic failure my fear be that this bill and the labour government amendment will make strike even more common in london do the hon member recall how many strike there be under the last conservative government as we have see already this be what be talk about the fairytale say that if we improve industrial relation and give trade union all the money they want suddenly there will not be any strike but what have happen in practice since the labour government come in trade union have be give all the money and they be still threaten to go on strike this bill really do read like militant trade union wish list strike mandate have double from six to month allow trade union to impose roll strike for whole year without ballot their member turnout requirement have be abolish so that minority can call strike and the government have remove the requirement for of member to vote and to support industrial action the bill reduce the notice for strike by four day and give employer less information make strike even more damaging to business and disruptive to people life it also allow unreasonable pay facility time for trade union make the taxpayer and company pay out even more for trade union representative at the same time that the labour government be raise everyone taxis and cut public service guess that the hon gentleman have never be member of trade union or participate in an industrial ballot member choose to go on strike once the ballot have finish no one force they to go on strike when member give up day pay to go on strike they do so because they be fight for improvement to their term and condition he be make out as though they be somehow compel to strike when member turn out for strike they do so because of their strength of feeling about the condition they face nothing more would have some sympathy for that argument if the threshold for the percentage of worker vote for strike be be maintain but we be now clearly leave the door open for minority of militant trade union member to go on strike and cause mass disruption will be honest and say that have never be member of trade union but my experience of trade union boss be that they live life that could never dream of as working class man to be quite frank as work class person from working class background learn at very young age that trade union and the labour party stop represent working class people many year ago and this government be prove it yet again give the hon gentleman comment about small number of militant trade unionist take industrial action if this bill become law it be worth note that over the last year small and militant group of conservative party member have manage to choose successive prime ministers with few requirement than those apply to member of trade union when they vote to take industrial action in their workplace do he think that be fair thank the hon lady for her rather odd intervention it have nothing to do with this bill but if more people have chance to vote on issue such as who should be the prime minister today suspect that they would come to completely different answer from the one they come to last july because this labour government have break every single promise that they make at the election can not wait for the public to have the opportunity to vote out this shocking labour government so be all for people have more chance to do so as and other conservative members have say already this bill be write by the trade union and for the trade union why be the government grant this wish list to the trade union the simple answer be that the labour party will benefit from these proposal as be teach as young man follow the money interruption yes do not follow it by come into this place over the past five year the labour party have receive more than million in political donation from the union this bill will remove the requirement for trade union member to opt in to those contribution instead they will have to opt out which mean more will unknowingly contribute to political cause that they do not support the government amendment will mean that trade union no long need to renew their political resolution every year and ultimately this will make it even easy for trade union to divert cash to political cause include the labour party in short this bill mean more strike more often and more money for the labour party and strike will be grind business to halt shut down public service and close public transport system again as note in my speech there be problem with the bill the hon member have mention the problem on public transport do he recall that in the train union and the train operate company actually resolve their dispute and do he regret that the transport minister at the time intervene to block that agreement to resolve the strike my experience as an mp be great frustration particularly in outer london about train company constantly go on strike with very small minority of train driver go on strike what we see from this government be load of money go straight to those same union without the productivity change that we would like to see and no adaptation in the system my personal opinion on some of these proposal be that it be increasingly likely that automation and loss of job will be direct consequence of the rigid trade union law be force on to more business suspect that the only thing that will rise in this parliament be unemployment these strike be costly disruptive and damaging to britain they ought to be last resort but this government proposal will take we back to the before be bear when strike be political tool for division damage and disruption this be yet more evidence that labour be not on the side of work people or of serious economic growth as its own impact assessment even partial tell we londoner will not thank this government if this result in yet more disruptive and long roll strike that grind our city down even far than mayor khan have work people will not thank this government for empower their trade union to bring our country to standstill especially as we pick up the bill as they fill their pocket draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests how much if the right hon member listen he will hear from my entry member will see that be proud member of the gmb and that my donation include those from entrepreneur and businesspeople alike who be collectively sick of the year of the conservative government will take no lesson from that party give its record over those year and none of the speech by conservative members have defend any achievement that be make in year relate to this bill or anything to do with our economy that be the party of eff business of striking nhs of furlough settlement for manchester worker of cash for covid contract of inflation high of liz truss of the mini budget disaster of zero growth of the collapse of infrastructure of public spending power disappear and of the state of our road and of our prospect it be for this reason that my entry include combination of gmb membership give the member and the worker that we represent and of the entrepreneur who want rid of that lot over there will the hon gentleman give way will make some progress the right hon gentleman have say plenty already and he come in only halfway through the debate be proud to stand on the labour side of the house as someone who have found business run business for other and run my own business fifteen year ago make commitment to be the voice of experience for good small business in the proud labour movement that we now have in government not least to challenge the claim of the conservatives that they alone represent business interest be proudly pro business and pro worker just as this government be fix the foundation of our economy mean fix the foundation of our employment just as the government be strengthen our economic base they be now lay down strong employment foundation run business be hard work it require an initial leap of faith the courage to embrace risk the ability to adjust the resilience to overcome failure and the perseverance to celebrate success the role of government be to improve life and live for everyone in this country the role of good employment be exactly the same small business be at the heart of this effort that be why the government be right to focus on skill value for money with public spending open up public sector commission to sme and challenger company and crucially the bill make employment more positive rewarding experience insecure work lead to insecure living and neither will improve life in britain we should highlight and support those employer who be already lead the way much of this legislation simply catch up to their high standard the weight of responsibility that come with create somebody else payslip can not be overstate it be humble sometimes worry and never easy it require teamwork and the skill of other but also leadership sometimes lonely leadership it mean shoulder risk and share reward that be why the government ambition for growth be the right one the focus must be on net growth lock in certainty for those in work by uphold right for the many while foster new opportunity to expand our economy want to salute those business and entrepreneur for whom much of this legislation emphasise the good practice they already uphold in bury business such as the lamppost café where declaration of interest madam deputy speaker my daughter work part time life store in ramsbottom wax and beans record and coffee shop in bury bloom avoira msl solution providers ernill bakery wallwork aerospace heat treatment and hargreave these business often family run be the backbone of bury and so they build the backbone of britain root in their community provide stability pride and good honest work for an honest day pay many stand ready to do more to grow invest and create more opportunity be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way could he tell we which of that fine list of business have say that they support the bill have have conversation with the vast majority of they they support the general actually if the right hon gentleman have be listen he will know that the argument be make be that on much of the propose legislation give right on day one be fair minded make work pay they be already do that the point be have just name several the most recent conversation have be with msl solution providers its challenge and argument be around tax credit an argument will make in due course but the conservatives claim of be the voice of small business and entrepreneurship be misguide misrepresent and frankly out of date once we have lay the new employment foundation we must support they in build their business far in particular for some that mean ensure that ai enhance and expand prospect and prosperity in the employment market and the wide economy lastly be proud to highlight my support for extend bereavement leave to those who experience miscarriage compassionate and essential measure that proudly support alongside my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen the bill be not just about legislative process it be about our value it be about recognise that thrive economy and fair society must go hand in hand with tackle our inequality it be about ensure that whether employer or employee the foundation on which our employment be build ensure strength for all rise as former member of trade union and the harsh lesson learn then be what concern about this bill as low pay journalist on local paper have hop that the union would go in to bat for instead it be more interested in cuban socialism and collective bargaining more concerned about traduce mrs thatcher legacy than the tribulation of junior reporter more interested in fund the labour party than support and my newsroom colleague that be why be back amendment such as amendment which seek to defuse what have be call subscription trap where inertia be use to allow political donation take from member to tick up year in year out be this the clean money of which the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana speak in the business and trade committee we have hear that good relation be possible between employer and trade union of course they be not all union rep be agitator any more than all boss be grasp exploiter of the worker but strip out exist protection as this bill do risk tilt the law too far in favour of the union make strike more frequent and more damaging thank to for example low notice period we know that the union be already restive just ask the secretary of state for scotland unable to attend an event with ironically the scottish confederation of british industry in his own office because he would not cross picket line and he have have to cancel at least one other event as the picket strike on if cabinet minister be already at the union mercy what chance do the general public have we have hear about positive trade union benefit but it be not all sunlit upland one rail union refuse to let boss use email for rota insist on fax machine imagine be one of the few member who remember those another left passenger inconvenience when it order member not to use footbridge as it have skim of snow on it no thick than the icing on cake they must be lick their lip at clause that remove previous threshold for strike action such as the turnout requirement and the support requirement think the public will support amendment that would keep exist benchmark as modest guardrail not to crack down on union but to limit the damage that hothead might inflict this skimpy bill cobble together with indecent haste to meet labour first day deadline bear all the hallmark of thank you note from labour to its union backer if it pass the union be go to party like it however labour members pocket supposedly pristine union donation should have care because that winter of discontent see the public lose patience with labour prime minister capture by the union history do not repeat precisely but this do look awfully familiar this afternoon want to talk about point that think many of we across the house would agree on employment right be quite useless without any sort of enforcement mechanism should first mention that be member of the community union and the union of shop distributive and allied workers and refer everyone to my entry in the register of members financial interests on enforcement be very pleased with clause increase the time for bring employment tribunal claim from three to six month it be result of extensive campaigning by pregnant then screw and other organisation include the national aids trust they be very aware on behalf of their member of something use to see regularly as solicitor lot of people who have be very badly treat in their employment be so traumatised that they can not come forward and make their claim within the three month time limit in addition that reduce the potential time available for negotiation between former employee and their former employer which be not in the good interest of either employee or employer it be therefore really good news for both party that we will have this increase in the amount of time available to bring those claim the other measure that be particularly delighted about in the bill be the creation of the fair work agency we absolutely need there to be accountability for employer that be not pay the national minimum wage they be few and far between and those that be not do pay it need to be properly monitor and subject to enforcement in order to create fair playing field for all company be sure that opposition members would completely agree that the national minimum wage be fundamental part of our society and that everyone should be pay it the other matter want to draw attention to be the adult social care negotiating body in my constituency significant number of people need adult social care and have stable workforce be important in deliver that lastly want to speak about the attitude towards trade union that we have hear from opposition members today when work as solicitor advise trade union member some time ago it be clear to both that people really need the advice they be get via their trade union and that the trade union would not continue to back their member with that advice if they do not have claim with reasonable prospect of success that mean that dispute could be settle which be in the good interest of both the employer and employee think the hon lady possibly misrepresent the intent of opposition members we be not anti trade union we be anti the drafting of this bill think it be important to make clear distinction between the two thank the hon lady for her point but think it be very difficult distinction to make that they be pro trade union but anti thing that make it easy for trade union to effectively represent worker to return to my point access to trade union mean access to good quality advice quick resolution of dispute and reduction in unrepresented litigant in person which in my experience can make life genuinely difficult for well mean employer every single thing in this bill will be good for worker but it will also be good for employer and will be very pleased to vote for it later today refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests and declare my unison membership although be also an ex solicitor be go to address the government amendment relate to enforcement rather than trade union right we have large demand for social care in cornwall as be the case in the constituency of my hon friend the member for congleton mrs russell our population tend to an old demographic and with many people leave friend and family to retire to cornwall the availability of care be very important our social care system be close to breaking point due to the combination of year of underfunding and fragmented privatised system skilled care worker be chronically underpaid for what they do often at minimum wage and we struggle to get and retain care worker the bill contain many provision that will help strengthen sick pay parental leave protection from unfair dismissal from day one improved family friendly right and flexible working measure to tackle zero hour contract include for agency worker and worker at umbrella company as well as for direct employee and strengthen redundancy right the bill also specifically give social care worker respect and recognition through fair pay agreement and reinstate the school support staff negotiating body it will be game changer for those low pay worker mostly woman who work in care and school the hon lady will be aware that there be debate on the national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill next week where we will debate whether health and social care provider should be exclude from national insurance contribution would she care to comment on whether labour members will support that amendment make in the house of lords local government funding will of course be increase to take that into account and fund for adult social care be rise and will rise far in the next three year settlement under this government to return to my speech in cornwall we have see the rise of care worker come from other country to work on sponsorship visa scheme these worker be often in financially precarious situation which increase their dependency some have be charge by their employer for induction travel or training in some case worker receive salary below the minimum wage to make up the cost of their flight to the uk refer colleague to my entry on the register of members financial interests my hon friend be make an excellent speech about the situation in her county do she agree that this be national problem that affect all our constituency it be certainly the case in berkshire and in read in particular that we need well pay for care worker and more understanding about the pressure they face in their very valuable work agree with my hon friend this matter affect the entire country unison for example have campaign about migrant care worker so yes this be national issue in cornwall those care worker be often give the early morning and late evening shift with no flexibility some sit on bench strand in cornish village that bus do not pass through wait from their morning shift to their first evening shift many health and social care worker on sponsorship visa be afraid to raise concern about their employment and living condition for fear of lose their employer sponsorship employer in turn can be aware of that and some even use it as an explicit threat that bring to the enforcement provision in the bill enforcement of statutory pay and employment right be poor in the social care sector pay enforcement rely on individual worker report breach his majesty revenue and customs investigate few than of care provider each year international worker and those from minority ethnic background be particularly vulnerable for individual right to become reality collective voice in the workplace and effective enforcement be key the law society report that the backlog in employment tribunal case stand at which be high than it be in this backlog need clearing and investment need to be make in employment tribunal the new fair work agency will have crucial role to play in reduce the burden on the employment tribunal system by provide focal point for advice on enforcement under government amendment in enable the disclosure of information under government amendment and in take on some of those enforcement power under government new clause and on behalf of those worker those power could really help low pay or migrant worker who do not have access to fund or to union representation to enforce their right or who fear dismissal if they take step in that direction government amendment will allow the fair work agency to investigate and combat fraud and exploitative employer thereby tackle the kind of modern slavery of international worker in the care industry that we have see recently government new clause will also give the fair work agency the power to recover the cost of enforcement which would help with the funding of the system however real investment will need to be make into enforcement for the new power to have tooth with timeline resource and fast track procedure for the new fair work agency welcome confirmation of the government commitment in this area may give member brief reminder that we be today talk to the new clause and amendment on trade union industrial action enforcement of labour market legislation and miscellaneous and general provision draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests wish to deal with new clause and which relate to recognition of the poa right to strike therefore also declare that be an honorary life member of the poa the word honorary mean that there be no financial relationship and be assure that would not even get south face cell or an extra pillow new clause and try to restore the fundamental right of prison officer to take industrial action in its various form the union have exist for year and although organise as trade union it have never take any form of industrial action that have endanger the prisoner the officer care for other staff or the wide community through all of its long history there be an industrial relation climate in which negotiation take place and dispute be resolve then in the conservative government under the criminal justice and public order act make it crime to induce any prison officer to take strike action or even to work to rule the trade union be tell very clearly that that would be criminal act and any trade union officer organise action even work to rule could be prosecute what the government then do this be why people become extremely cynical at the time be to plan increase in the pension age make extensive salary cut and cut staff number there be no way the union could fight back in any form to protect its member some hon member who be about at the time may recall that in the poa face high six figure fine in the high court when it take action on health and safety ground by convene meeting of member it be threaten with legal action and the union leader be threaten with imprisonment ironically it would have be interesting to ask who would lock they up but that be another question altogether when the police have their right to strike take away it be almost like covenant and they be give very specific commitment around how they would be protect on pay pension and condition of work that be never offer to the poa and there be never any negotiation like that where it would at least be give some security in return for the loss of that right that be never give the poa take the government to the european court of human rights in and the case be accept the court urge the government to engage with the union in good faith over what remedy would be available the then government refuse to engage and the current government be still not engage so one of the reason for table the new clause be to urge the government to start engage with the union around that particular issue all the union be ask for be that its member be treat like any other worker and for the government to engage the right to strike in scotland be restore year ago and there have be no strike action since that have create an industrial relation climate that be conducive to work together not to enter into conflict but to negotiate problem out think that that be result of both side know that there be the alternative if necessary of take part in industrial action as most people know industrial action in public service be often not strike it be usually work to rule to start off negotiation have be member of trade union for year have be trade union officer lay official and so on every union that have know where there be any form of industrial action that in any way involve public service always put in place negotiate arrangement to protect the people that they be serve that be not just life and limb protection but often ensure standard of service that be still acceptable to people therefore urge the minister to get back round the table with the poa there be debate in committee on this matter which anger people and anger have go over the debate it show shameful disrespect for prison officer and an ignorance of the role that they play and the work environment that they work in there be reference to screw and guard and thing like that and about how somehow if the right be restore the union would allow prisoner to run amok and put the whole community at risk that be never the case it never have be and never would be there be lack of understanding about what those worker put up with as many hon member know there be overcrowd prison officer deal with prisoner with huge mental health issue drug problem and health problem overall there be record level of violence in prison and prison officer be injure almost daily as result of assault have to say that the disrespect demonstrate in the committee be part and parcel of the demoralisation of even more of our worker in those key role therefore ask the minister to re engage to get back round the negotiating table and to recognise that the issue will not go away these member want their basic trade union right back and if necessary they will go back before the european court believe they will win and that we will unnecessarily go through another period in which the demoralisation of worker continue because of people lack of respect for their basic trade union right we be suffer real problem in recruitment and retention so urge the government just to take that one step back to the negotiating table with the poa rise in support of government new clause and refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my proud trade union membership ask the opposition to consider their comment today in what have prove to be very ideologically drive debate on their part feel somewhat as if have be transport back in time to previous reform labour government last upgrade to employment right the minimum wage debate this afternoon fearmongere about productivity growth and unemployment be reminiscent of it we also have see some crossover in the personnel who be part of the conservative opposition the then shadow secretary of state for work and pensions the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith say that the minimum wage would negatively affect not hundred of thousand but million of people official report july vol unless the opposition have since develop policy to repeal the national minimum wage let face it under their current leadership anything be possible must tell they that progress be come be talk about work that pay dignity and job security invite they to get on board with the upgrade to right at work rather than spend the come decade pretend that they be on board in the first place my hon friend will remember that in when the conservatives announce the employment bill that be never produce they say that it would represent the big upgrade of worker right by any conservative government ever would she care to speculate on why they set their ambition so low some comment from opposition members today have make it very clear to the public what the opposition think about people right at work the hon member be make passionate and inspiring speech about the national minimum wage be she aware that just last year the leader of the scottish labour party admit that his family business be not pay member of staff the living wage do she think that be rank hypocrisy think that everyone should be on board with the national minimum wage and the living wage hope that we can encourage all member of all party to get on board be very pleased to hear that commitment and concern from the reform party it be unexpected but respect it on second reading welcome this legislation as central tenet of this government policy of put work people at the heart of our economy and make work pay be delighted to see the bill return to the chamber and pay tribute to those who serve on the public bill committee the bill modernise the uk outdate employment law bring in more than much need and welcome reform include day one right of employment ban exploitative zero hour contract abolish fire and rehire establish bereavement leave

the government have table amendment to strengthen protection for low pay worker include those relate to statutory sick pay in real term million people on zero hour contract will benefit from the guarantee hour policy nine million people who have be with their employer for less than two year will benefit from day one right relate to the unfair dismissal policy because of the fair work agency holiday pay right will be enforce for the very first time the measure before we strengthen the fair work agency new clause will enable it to bring proceeding against non compliant employer in an employment tribunal in place of the worker new clause enable the provision of legal advice or representation for those who have become party to civil proceeding relate to employment or trade union law although the vast majority of employer across the country include hundred in clwyd east will certainly obey the law there be still those that sadly do not citizens advice report state that higher pay worker be more likely than lower pay individual to bring an employment tribunal claim despite the fact that lower pay individual be more likely to have their right violate as unison point out leave the burden of challenge workplace injustice to individual worker seek redress at tribunal compound inequality of power in the uk labour market the low pay commission figure highlight key reason to implement these important measure we know for instance that of worker be pay less than minimum wage in and that nearly million worker do not get any holiday pay the agency will bring together exist state enforcement function and will be single place to which worker and employer can turn for help be pleased that the agency will aim to resolve issue upstream by support employer that want to comply understand from evidence gather by the bill committee that there be considerable support for single enforcement body in place of what be currently quite fractured system on accountability the bill require an annual report on the fair work agency enforcement action and will allow parliament to monitor progress in protect worker right be encourage to hear that to produce its strategy the fair work agency will consult an advisory board make up of trade union business and independent expert it be vital that we continue our collaborative approach in develop employment legislation and policy that be pro business pro worker and ultimately pro growth welcome the new clause and the bill as whole it be an important part of the government strategy to move our economy forward improve work

the service industry essential utility social care transport or health the day of exploitation be now over the labour party be do what we do well and will always do protect work people promote decent pay and work and deliver meaningful change for so many we be put power in the hand of work people the government commitment to grow the economy will be build on rebalancing right at work and raise living standard in every part of this country the two be interweave the government amendment will ensure just that by boost the enforcement of right and give the new fair work agency the power to bring civil proceeding against non compliant employer that seek to underpay staff in one in five worker be pay less than the minimum wage that will stop almost million worker in this country do not

the practice of employer lock out work day window for employer and union to negotiate access and new right for union to access the workplace which could be transformative as it give worker fair voice to improve their pay and condition it be time to turn the page on the combative and unproductive approach adopt by the previous government and it be time to modernise the industrial relation framework the bill and the amendment support much need reset of industrial relation across great britain this government have clear mandate to deliver real change that work people in my constituency of west dunbartonshire can see and feel that change can not come soon enough the employment rights bill be the crucial first step on that path it be the big uplift in worker right in generation and be proud to vote for it and support it today be grateful to be call twice on report and as be customary draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my membership of unite be also the chair of the gmb parliamentary group start with comment that have not plan to make at the beginning of this debate much have be hear about register of interest as the shadow minister the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith who be in his place say at the end of the bill committee labour members have be assiduous in draw attention to their membership of trade union and their declaration in register of interest but believe that the hon member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti be the first conservative member to draw attention to his own donation without be challenge first much of the tone of this debate have focus not on the substance of the bill but on ascribed motivation which believe have be demean to the standard and courtesy expect in this house there be much to welcome in the government amendment wish to concentrate my remark on new clause and new schedule on political fund ballot the year requirement date to the trade union act the requirement do not apply to any political fund that may be maintain by employer association nor do successful ballot in any way infringe on trade union member right to withdraw payment from the political fund at any time so think we can be confident about that policy intention it be to tie up trade union time and resource and in that respect it be successful these ballot be massive abstraction of resource which get in the way of trade union and trade union member core business of represent people at work in year not one union member have vote to discontinue political fund trade union be democratic organisation if there be discontent in union over political fund expenditure any member be entitle to inspect the account and that expenditure can be stop in whole or in part through exist democratic structure there be think contradiction when this house representative democratic institution may seek to instruct other organisation to make decision by referendum to those who have suggest that trade union political expenditure be somehow illegitimate would just like to remind member that trade union political fund expenditure be not synonymous with party political donation in fact many important campaign that have win cross party support in this place be make possible only because of trade union political fund expenditure draw member attention to one such campaign which be proud to be associate with the protect the protectors campaign start with the campaign work of gmb and unison member in the ambulance service and result in the assault on emergency workers offences act if the measure that have be put forward at different stage in this process be successful in restrict that political fund activity it would be hard to deliver that legislative change in this place on behalf of work people much have be say in the debate and do not wish to duplicate it but wish to say few word about the situation at amazon in coventry much trade union work in the private sector in recent year have be focus on the warehousing and logistic sector where focus of trade union activity have be the increasingly intensive workload worker employment be terminate on the basis of unclear and unaccountable target setting and high rate of musculoskeletal injury which have contribute to high rate of people be out of work in the wide economy when the gmb in response to approach from its member initially contact amazon to seek voluntary recognition at that site in december the company report that there be people work at the site the company refuse to engage meaningfully with the union or attend talk at acas to resolve the situation as have be say in the space of just few month the number of people at the site be increase dramatically by some of they be temporary worker transfer from other site it have be report that other be new worker on student visa who be worried about the potential implication for their study and immigration status if union recognition be vote for as consequence of that increase the union could still meet the membership threshold but could not meet the requirement of of the bargaining group be likely to support recognition new schedule remedy that flaw by freeze the bargaining unit from the start of the application similarly the schedule bar the use of unfair practice from the start of that process that will address loophole in the statutory code of practice that have be exploit to the full in coventry the union describe culture of fear bear out of intimidatory tactic and lack of equality of access contrary to the principle that this house have already endorse the recognition ballot fail as we have hear by just vote pay tribute to the gmb officer and above all the member who lead the campaign they come so close in the face of concerted union bust campaign as one amazon worker say do want jeff bezos boat definitely do want his rocket just want to live the opposition argue in committee that we should not legislate in response to individual case but disagree once it have be prove that system can be exploit more will follow amazon action at coventry be clearly contrary to the intention of the house of commons when it establish the statutory recognition regime year ago freeze the bargaining unit be incredibly important as be the extension of the code of practice wish that in the time available could say more about the trade union right of access which build upon successful international system particularly in australia where over the last year it have become an accepted and constructive part of their industrial relation framework and have survive and indeed be enhance throughout multiple change of govern party the digital right of access include in the amendment be important particularly for those employer who do not have traditional physical workplace it be important that the digital right of access do not become the default when application be make and be sure that ministers will bear that in mind as the measure be implement to close my remark in what may be the last debate that back benchers can contribute to on this legislation let say that part of the reason we come to this place be to provide more freedom more comfort at time of hardship and more protection against abuse to our constituent that be as true at work as it be everywhere else of course there will always be other cause measure and change that we individually would like to see but this bill and the change and improvement we will make to it tonight be the reason our constituent send we to this place it have be say that this legislation represent the big advance in worker right in generation think it be perhaps the big step forward since the trade disputes act what we will do tonight be truly historic and will be proud to join the lobby to vote it through refer member to my declaration of interest which clearly state my positive relationship with the trade union movement be member of community and the gmb and that be where want to begin my contribution my father proud usdaw member recruit to his union the very first day that have proper job aged draw real wage with pay packet and pay slip have step into the grow up world and join union be part of my graduation be bring up to believe that union have our back and can help with issue like unfair dismissal discrimination harassment and bullying as an mp when be approach by constituent with problem at work my first question be be you member of trade union in bassetlaw good company and organisation like cargill schutz cinch connectors cerealto autism east midlands and bassetlaw hospital have good partnership with union like the gmb and welcome that as small business woman serve for year on the national executive of the long ago merge manufacturing science and finance union that be where reinforce my value and belief that trade union be force for good in the workplace where partnership work with the employer serve to increase productivity pride and share understanding such partnership mean that many of the key employment measure in the employment rights bill have already be adopt by many major employer who regard good employee relation as key element for their competitive success in the market in which they operate when people go to work but have no certainty about the hour that they will work or what their weekly income will be it be unfair when they go to work with the fear that they may be sack tomorrow for no reason it be unfair when they be pay below the minimum wage for day work it be unfair and when they be ill and face three day without pay it be unfair this bill be about put fairness back into work and put pride into our workplace we need to end the zero hour contract and the trickery of fire and rehire deliver day one protection from unfair dismissal and extend right to sick pay to million people be also member of union the british medical association have find that union to be useful to as it have represent in the past so can see the benefit of union be concern however that the measure that the hon lady be talk about in relation to day one sick pay for example could make it more difficult for those with disability to get job particularly with the change to zero hour contract as well talk to local businessman in my constituency about gentleman he employ who have disability who come and go because his disability make it difficult for he to work for long period of time but he say that he simply will not be able to continue to employ he once the legislation come into force that be what good strong trade union partnership be about ensure that worker have the intervention that they need in order to be able to work will be support the benefit bill that we will be introduce in the future because that will ensure that workplace be open and accessible to people with disability it be important that people have the right to work and the capacity to work when they need to the bill be back by my constituent who want to work hard but also want fairness in the workplace tonight will be vote for strengthen right at work for million of british people we can all stand up and be count to support our constituent who deserve fairness and justice at work to the reform mp who be no long in the chamber support the status quo be betrayal for million of british worker we all have constituent who need well workplace right and this be our chance to deliver change be member of unite the union but rise to make my remark from the perspective of business owner and employer in response to comment make by conservative members who have now wander off about small and medium sized business these be personal comment and will give my personal perspective but know many business large and small that share this point of view before come to this place be run business of various shape and size for well over year do my mba at manchester business school have start and lead several business and have serve on the board of many other so have be about bit throughout that time it be always clear in my mind that whatever the business the critical success factor be always the skill drive and quality of the people that the business employ or contract to succeed any business must attract the good possible people that be why have always feel that the selection and recruitment process be my key role in any organisation that lead will always argue that great business by which mean those with sustained success will always be good employer when look at the measure in this bill all see be the thing that good employer be already do we know that support for employee when they have child pay off in the long term we know that give employee job security increase their commitment and productivity we support our people when they be sick and we know that take holiday be vital to maintain performance we do not unfairly dismiss whether someone have be with we for one day or for many year we have rigorous recruitment process and we make it clear that employee must show they meet requirement for job during the probationary period we pay as well as we can know that employee who feel value will deliver for our business up until now good employer have always feel the risk of be undercut by unscrupulous and short term disruptor look to make quick buck this be real and serious issue have experience it in business and many other business owner have raise it with business do the right thing should not be disadvantaged yet weak and outdated employment legislation have leave they expose this bill level the play field good employer can keep on do what they do know that their competitor can no long undercut they by for instance employ majority of their staff on zero hour contract not give holiday pay fire and rehire or just underpay this bill be good for good business and good for worker it be good for growth and for society it will put more money in people pocket and deliver real tangible benefit for work people and be very pleased to support it draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests which include my membership of gmb unison and the chartered society of physiotherapy when speak on second reading welcome the advancement that this bill would make on statutory sick pay maternity and paternity pay and protection around pregnancy as well as its value of fairness support new clause and it be only right that if someone have do fair day work and business fail to pay they the secretary of state should have the authority to give notice of underpayment no one in britain should go home from an honest day work out of pocket and worried about pay their bill also welcome the secretary of state intervention on impose financial penalty on business that make underpayment believe that poor practice in the workplace should be call out and that those responsible should be hold accountable however we also need an adequately resource fair work agency so support new clause table by the chair of the business and trade committee my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne the agency should be agile enough to tackle issue upstream by support business that want to comply with the law as well as have enough resource to tackle meaningfully non compliant business on the business and trade committee we hear from several business some of which be great employer and some of which be unable to justify their malpractice with evidence of modern day slavery in their supply chain we can not have company get away with poor practice where worker can not use the toilet be not entitle to their break or fail to get their fair pay transparency accountability and enforcement be key but we must remember that most business do their good by their worker and have witness that since second reading have meet with business owner in several sector from steelworker and scaffolder to restaurant owner and retail during my visit and roundtable in my constituency of dudley both worker and employer often tell that they want the same thing the stability to grow and fiscally responsible government who care about they and their future stability be not zero sum game research show that when business look after their employee they create more loyal and productive workforce which in turn strengthen business and help they to grow the economy in digital research by deloitte find that foster trust opportunity for growth and employee well be be the key to increase workforce retention and satisfaction to reassure business we know that the implementation of this bill will be in phase that approach promise to allow step by step upskilling of hr professional and to update employment practice one step at time they will not be expect to be employ until therefore ask the minister to provide road map outline detail of future consultation with two year timeline to help to guide business owner to provide stability for business road map would undoubtedly help to ease grow pain allow small business time to plan the necessary administration upskilling and ability to resource for the fair work agency both worker and business in dudley would benefit greatly from that stability and wholeheartedly support this bill rise to support the bill and in particular government new schedule must also draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my membership of both the gmb and unite trade union should also make clear to the house my employment history both as chief executive officer and manage director of company in the united states the uk and israel and my record as company founder and employer be very proud of have be union member since my first day at work when join what be the association of scientific technical and managerial staffs can probably add few year to the membership of my hon friend the member for derby south baggy shanker but it will be few more year before catch up with my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell be also very proud to be support this bill and the government amendment so that we can deliver reform that be rightly pro business and pro worker the bill will also put more money in people pocket and deliver real life improvement that will be feel by work people key amendment that have be table will strengthen protection for the lowest pay worker extend protection from exploitative zero hour contract and boost the voice of work people in my constituency of mansfield particularly welcome the government new schedule which will update framework for trade union reflect modern work practice and rebalance industrial relation it will ensure that the size of workplace bargaining unit will be freeze and can not be increase during the recognition process recent example of where this new schedule would have support worker occur at amazon when my union the gmb first apply for statutory recognition there amazon report that it have employee work at the site and refuse to have any discussion on trade union recognition amazon worker face david versus goliath fight in have to prove that they have at least support in the workplace for union recognition as amend the bill will vastly simplify that process with the new schedule freeze the bargaining unit at the point of application we want to be able to bring good practice and good employer to our constituency in bh live company base in my constituency be name as not pay of the lowest pay worker in my constituency the national minimum wage ultimately bh live do make payment but do my hon friend agree that it be wrong for anybody to be pay less than the national minimum wage and that through the introduction of the new fair work agency we be go to be able to right wrong like that absolutely agree my hon friend have spell out why enforcement be so important would happily speak far in support of so many of the amendment that have be table but be acutely aware that we be at the end of the debate the hon gentleman be come to his exciting peroration so just want to say that he be absolutely right about the feckless behaviour of corporate business that disregard the interest of their worker and share his view of trade union however do he recognise that there be world of difference between the burden we place on those organisation that can happily deal with they and the effect that some part of the bill will have perhaps unintentionally on very small business imagine that the business he start be such business at least at the beginning this bill have cause fear among small business and microbusinesse there be real distinction between those heartless corporate and the hard work sme in the hon gentleman constituency and mine be there not as small business founder and someone who have grow business recognise the need for balance be grateful to the right hon member for raise that point in my concluding remark put on the record how proud be of my union the gmb and unite for the work that they have do with this government to help deliver this groundbreaking legislation will therefore be vote with pride to support the bill in the lobby later today we have have another excellent debate we might have to deal with few misconception but be conscious that we need to move on to third reading so apologise if do not address every single contribution we have hear today will start with the chair of the select committee my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne and his new clause the bill already require the secretary of state to produce an annual report for employment right enforcement as well as an enforcement strategy every three year both document will be lay before parliament allow for parliamentary scrutiny we be commit to give the fair work agency the resource it need to do its job effectively agree with he that the number of prosecution for minimum wage violation have be pitifully small in recent year we should never tolerate lawbreaker in the business world we should ensure that responsible and well perform business be never allow to be undercut by minimum wage violation my right hon friend amendment would include digital mean of communication with worker in union right of access to workplace appreciate the good intention behind the amendment but the government be already commit to modernise working practice and move away from reliance on ad hoc access arrangement we recognise the importance of provide for digital right of access in addition to the physical access for which the bill already provide that be why we have amend the bill to expand access right allow for access agreement to include communication with worker other than by mean of physical access to workplace such as digital mean my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald talk about procurement his new clause would amend the procurement act to place duty on the secretary of state to ensure that any contract enter into by either government department an executive agency of government non departmental public body or non ministerial department must comply with certain requirement relate to the recognition of trade union we recognise that the recognition of trade union for collective bargaining be an important feature of the previous two tier code on workforce matter the bill contain power to reinstate and strengthen the code by way of regulation and statutory code so assure the house that the government be commit to strengthen trade union recognition and collective bargaining right new clause in the name of the hon member for dundee central chris law would result in change to the scotland act by remove employment law from the list of reserved matter thereby bring it within the competence of the scottish parliament while his perseverance on this issue be not unnoticed it would come as no surprise to he be he here that the government have no intention of devolve employment law to the scottish parliament previous scotland acts have already create one of the most powerful devolve parliaments in the world when there be considerably more snp members here during the last parliament there be ten minute rule bill on this very subject and the snp could not even get majority of its own member to support it so why on earth would we support such measure now do not know will turn to the amendment from my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell on prison officer right to strike thank he for his persistence and his active engagement on behalf of prison officer as he say prison officer be prevent from take industrial action under current legislation their pay be govern by the independent prison service pay review body process which act as compensatory mechanism for that restriction there be limited contingency to deal with industrial action and during such incident the reliance be on narrow pool of operational manager with some potential for very limited support from the police and army in limited circumstance that create operational risk and be not sustainable for any period of time my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington refer to what he class as disrespect to prison officer during that debate in committee just put on record that there be certainly no disrespect show by those on the government benches we value and respect the work that prison officer do know that he will continue to pursue this matter and suggest that he contact the ministry of justice which have the remit hope it will be able to engage on the matter in future let now deal with some of the liberal democrat new clause and amendment the hon member for st albans daisy cooper speak about new clause which would give the secretary of state the power to set out and define in regulation the professional body that could represent employee at disciplinary meeting it be unclear to we where the demand for that would come from and would expect it to benefit some business that have raise the prospect with successive government what be clear however be that expand the type of organisation that could be involve in represent worker at such meeting could lead to hearing require legal representation for both the worker and the employer that would increase the cost of hold hearing would escalate matter and would potentially decrease the chance of an amicable resolution as both party become entrenched in dispute we believe that trade union be well place to represent employee in disciplinary and grievance hearing in the workplace and statutory provision be already in place to enable they to do that the hon member for st albans also table new clause which relate to legal aid for employment dispute be committed to ensure that worker be able to enforce their employment right and we be work closely with the ministry of justice to ensure that happen look into what further improvement we can make to the way in which acas and employment tribunal operate key benefit of move enforcement to the fair work agency be that it will make it easy and quick for worker to secure justice without the need for additional legal representation or legal aid hope that give the hon lady some reassurance that we be look seriously at the issue new clause also table by the hon member for st albans would require the secretary of state to publish review on the impact of part of the bill on sme within month of the passage of this act in the impact assessment the government have set out our initial plan for monitor an evaluation of the impact of the bill as well as some secondary legislation say this with the great respect to the hon lady she have express concern about the burden on business but if we have accept all her party amendment yesterday that would have add several billion pound to the cost of business the liberal democrats will have to decide ideally tonight whether they be in favour of worker right or not let now deal with some of the amendment from the official opposition amendment seek to increase from seven to day the notice period that trade union be require to adhere to when notify employer that they plan to take industrial action our consultation on the creation of modern framework for industrial relation seek view on what an appropriate notice period would be recognise that the repeal of the trade union act would reduce the notice period from to seven day the government have listen carefully to the concern express by respondent to the consultation who fear that seven day notice period would not provide enough time for union to prepare for industrial action in some important sector such as transport healthcare and education with possible knock on impact on other service the government believe that employer should be give enough time to mitigate the most severe effect of industrial action and acknowledge response to the consultation argue that seven day notice be insufficient of course we do have seven day notice between and under the tory government the tories lack of understanding of the bill be clear from the number of time we hear that it would take we back to the whereas in fact it will take we back to when an early version of the bill be introduce the government view be that day provide the appropriate balance in enable employer to mitigate the impact of industrial action and reduce disruption and the knock on impact of strike while also respect the right to strike amendment seek to remove clause which deal with political fund and which think prompt the most heated debate it be notable that when it come to reduce tory red tape it be only trade union that do not receive the same benefit as everyone else there have think be fundamental misunderstanding of what trade union be it be member base democratic organisation design to protect those who be part of it comparison with netflix subscription and insurance contract be bogus because they be not the same thing at all membership of trade union and political fund be not subscription that people sign up to for fix period it be membership of democratically organised and independent trade union which they be free to leave at any time member have control of the organisation because it be democratically organise and they can decide as union whether to have political fund at all people can not email the chief executive of netflix and demand that it make programme star their favourite actor but if people be unhappy with trade union they have the opportunity to get involve and change it it should be note that in the year that we have have political fund ballot no union have disaffiliate from the labour party as result of that there have be no closure of political fund so it be very clear that this be simply red tape of course it be not all about fund the labour party because nearly half of all union that have political fund be not affiliate with the labour party if conservative member be not satisfied with that they should read the bill that be before they because the clause that they want to remove clause set out in subsection how member can opt out of political fund it even set out the way they can do so by post email or electronic mean some of the patronising comment we have hear about people be trap into something that they do not wish to be in do not reflect the reality of the situation or the ability of trade union member to make up their own mind and exercise their democratic right have any conservative members ever be member of trade union they would understand that the repeat insinuation from conservative members that or any anyone else on the labour benches have bring forward this bill because we have be pay by the trade union to do so be offensive and wrong in equal measure they might think money buy you the chance to write the law but that say far more about their approach to legislation than it do about ours on the labour benches we do these thing because we believe in they we believe that everyone deserve fair treatment at work and this bill deliver that it be deliver on our value in conclusion the bill represent generational shift in protection long overdue reinforcement of worker right in this country and tangible proof of how labour government can bring meaningful benefit to people life for many of we it be fundamental to why we be in the labour party so now be not the time to shy away from our effort now be not the time to talk about what might have be it be the time to be bold to be loud and to be proud that this labour government be deliver by put fairness dignity and security back into the workplace question put that the clause be read second time diane abbott jack abbott debbie abrahams shockat adam luke akehurst bayo alaba dan

committee also acknowledge the work of official in the department and in parliament their job can not have be easy give the indecent haste with which the bill have be produce we disagree on much but it would be churlish of not to recognise that today represent personal victory for the deputy prime minister the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner while the secretary of state for business and trade the right hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds and the chancellor of the exchequer the right hon member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves lie low there be no doubt who have be in the drive seat interruption well he be now he here now it be order we welcome he to his place at least the deputy prime minister be honest in her unwavering support for the trade union agenda she be proud to walk in the footstep of neil kinnock michael foot and the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn conviction politician in the proper sense of the word not politician with conviction like the labour member for runcorn and helsby mike amesbury it make welcome well he go it make welcome change from prime minister who pretend the bill be about growth it be

wonder the right hon lady be in favour of make it hard to be sack this be sad day for business and bad day for parliament business will have watch the last two day with they will watch this with dismay as well madam deputy speaker as they struggle with the chancellor job tax and with the business rate hike about to hit next month they see hundred of page of red tape head their way they will have see the minister yesterday ask to name single small business who support the bill reel off the name of three large one two of which turn out not to support it anyway and the third be quote from the chief inclusion officer at the co op my right hon friend the member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke put it well yesterday when he say the government plan to increase the number of small business by start with large one and make they small no one who care about parliament legislate well can be proud of how we have get here rush bill which be introduce at half the length to which it have now grow an impact assessment which the regulatory policy committee describe as not fit for purpose over page of amendment few of which be scrutinize in committee and speech in favour that have lean heavily in support of the trade union who stand to gain so much financially from the bill but my final word go to the can do some more the final word go to the real they do not want to hear it madam deputy speaker the final word go to the real victim of this bill face with this legislation employer will take few risk on new employee as result this bill will hit young people disproportionately hard they do not have the track record to rely on someone give they the chance first step into the world of work unlike so many labour members whose first job be at comfortable desk in tuc congress house my first job be at supermarket that company be able to take risk on young andrew griffith with no career experience it be able to take that chance because it know that could not start work in the morning and then file an employment tribunal claim in the afternoon know that for many labour cabinet member career experience on their cv be sensitive topic but that do not excuse what be vindictive attack on the next generation the truth be that labour do not understand business they do not understand what it take to grow they never have and they never will every labour government have leave office with unemployment high than when they start and that be why we can not support this terrible bill question put that the bill be now read the third time diane abbott jack

educational attainment and experience among ethnic minority pupil and make recommendation to tackle institutional racism in the education system the inquiry lead by lord swann be launch in response to number of campaign against racism in education in particular the high profile scandal of educationally subnormal esn school that disproportionately remove high number of black caribbean child from mainstream education setting and wrongly label they educationally subnormal mixture of education policy and racist attitude be responsible for this shocking discrimination the be time of rise immigration with the post war british empire invitation to the windrush generation of worker from the caribbean and its other colony to rebuild britain it be also time of significant racist backlash with the overt racism of enoch powell and the notion of racial superiority that gain traction in the political mainstream these idea work their way into our national education policy with the aim of create and maintain two tier labour force and deliberately under educate black population to fill all the menial job that white brits do not want this significant miscarriage of justice take place in the and and see hundred of black mostly caribbean child wrongly send to school that be mean for pupil with severe physical and mental disability these school have exist since the due to the provision under the education act of appropriate school for pupil with severe mental or physical disability but by the late almost of pupil in esn school in london be black immigrant child compare with in mainstream school it be clear that decision be be make by teacher educational psychologist and local education authority to place these child in esn school for reason other than mental or physical disability although parent be aware that their child be be force to struggle against racist system most be isolate and not give the information that they need to make informed decision about their child education it be not until an inner london education authority report be leak that the true extent of this shocking discrimination be reveal grenadian educator bernard coard take the initiative to write and publish the groundbreaking pamphlet how the west indian child be make educationally subnormal in the british school system make the leak ilea information accessible to parent and community mass community mobilisation as result of coard pamphlet inspire parent and community organisation to campaign against the now undeniable institutional racism in british school that force the government to respond and these school be eventually shut down in the early publish in march swann report confirm coard analysis the persistence of racist stereotype biased iq test deep misunderstanding of culture and language and bias in teacher expectation disciplinary practice and curriculum content be create significant barrier to education for black child it challenge the racist myth that black child be less intelligent than their white counterpart and recognise instead that the structural racism embed in the british education system be disadvantage they inadequate support for pupil with english as second language lack of diversity in the curriculum and significant disconnect between school and parent from ethnic minority background be identify as further barrier to black child achieve their full academic potential commend the hon lady for secure the debate speak to she beforehand to ask permission to intervene look at the swann report which she have outline very clearly do she agree that although substantial stride have be take since that eye opening report the learning curve for the integration and understanding that we all wish to see must continue as we strive to ensure that each of we can claim the good of british education incorporate our own ethnic background and rich cultural history and heritage thing be well but there be still lot more to do thank the hon member for his intervention however as will say later in my speech do not think that thing have substantially improve as he suggest for lot of black child in our education system the report produce several key recommendation include diversify and decolonise the curriculum more diversity in teacher recruitment anti racism training for teacher more resource for language support well data collection and monitoring and well approach to work with parent and community to build trust and encourage active participation in pupil education predictably the thatcher government do little to progress those recommendation however the follow labour government take some of the lesson learn as framework for our race relations amendment act particularly the introduction of the duty for public institution include school to promote racial equality however we know that many racist barrier still exist in education from disparity in educational attainment to the school to prison pipeline the adultification of black pupil to the presence of police in school and the need for truly anti racist curriculum today pattern of racism segregation and exclusion in education have evolve directly from the policy and attitude that drive the esn scandal the closure of esn school in the lead directly to rapid expansion in the use of school exclusion we begin to see high number incarcerate in prison and the expansion of the use of set and tiere in education whereby certain group of child be increasingly deny the opportunity to sit exam at certain level and then the opportunity to progress in educational setting include university the establishment of pupil referral unit be recognise as another method of systematic exclusion from education we must be clear the use of pru and exclusion be symptom of failure of the education system the disruptive behaviour of child be cry for help not crime an education system that do not respond with care and support be an education system that be break the number of exclusion have soar in recent year with child as young as five be kick out of school draconian behavioural policy disproportionately impact on poor child those live in care and those from black caribbean mixed and gypsy roma and traveller background swann recommendation for an inclusive education system be more important today and we must take this opportunity to update the lesson learn and apply they to our current system the societal impact be still as relevant today as it be in the and lesson must be learn on the anniversary of the swann report in order to put an end to this systemic discrimination evidence of the scale of the injustice of child be force needlessly into esn school in the and be scarce but we do know about the impact that misclassification as educationally subnormal have have on survivor some of whom have join we in the public gallery would like to take this opportunity to thank they for all their work in expose this scandal and campaign

perform and introduce new annual review of safeguarding attendance and pupil movement include off rolling one of the lesson learn through the work that people have do on the esn scandal be about the role of unconscious bias we hear from parent expert teacher educational psychologist and other that unconscious bias have the same cause as exclusion one of the reason why people be call for an inquiry be to look at the lesson that can be learn by ofsted and other agency about how we support school and address their practice the right hon gentleman raise an important point we have learn lot in the past year about unconscious bias and its impact will come on to the point he raise about the public inquiry and the development over the year the protection put in place which we need to work
