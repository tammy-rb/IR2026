it be clear that we be today debate methodology rather than value certainly do not dispute the minister value at all we all want to see the grow need meet and the environment protect the question that we be debate today be the good methodology for achieve those outcome have submit number of amendment cover three area which will rattle through as quickly as can all of which support the theme that my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos advance today and indeed that he have pursue in committee in previous week amendment relate to housing target it propose allow local authority to adopt target that reduce housing need rather than simply target to build home house building target be in many area part of the problem rather than the solution to housing need for example since the cornwall housing stock have be among the fast growing in the united kingdom it have almost treble yet housing problem for local people have get significantly bad over that time simply set house building target result in massive hope value be attach to every single community around cornwall have work as chief executive of charity that try to build affordable home can say that establish house building target make it more difficult to address the housing need of local people target that be about reduce need would change the dynamic of the planning system in place that face these problem unfortunately the approach to house building target that have be adopt by party over the previous decade be build on the delusion that private developer will collude with government to drive down the price of their finished product we can no long carry on in that delusion we can not and should not pursue counterproductive methodology amendment and new clause be consequential on the fundamental change propose in amendment my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington have speak about introduce new class order to address the prevalence of non permanent occupancy in some area the previous government be look at bring in new class order for holiday let but that should be extend to second home and all home of non permanent occupancy new clause which be consequential on new clause propose introduce sunset clause for planning permission to ensure that there be not perverse incentive for people to apply to change property use in order to enhance the value of their property when they sell it this be not about the politic of envy but the politic of social justice think those who represent area or constituency with large number of second home properly understand how these thing operate finally table number of amendment relate to affordability include new clause on affordable development and new clause new clause would prohibit cross subsidy or at least open market development on rural exception site those site should not be call rural exception site they should be call rural norm site that should be the methodology for deliver affordable home in rural area it
