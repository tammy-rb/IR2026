prayer the second deputy chairman of ways and means take the chair as deputy speaker standing order no beg to move that the house sit in private question put forthwith standing order no and negative rare cancers bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time we all know someone who have suffer from rare cancer brain tumour childhood cancer pancreatic cancer liver cancer or one of the other cancer on long list that be unfortunately all too familiar each of they may statistically be consider rare but collectively they be anything but rare blood cancer uk state that rare and less common cancer account for of all uk cancer diagnosis staggering year the irony of the bill title be that so call rare cancer be not rare common cancer deserve attention but so too do rare cancer want to share an example of family in my constituency who be confront with rare cancer tilly first symptom be leg pain and loss of appetite this be in september when face to face gp consultation be not possible on visit she be give ibuprofen it be think that she might have virus six week later she return to and be transfer to the cancer ward where she be diagnose with stage neuroblastoma on diagnosis she be give chance of survival despite undergo over dozen round of chemotherapy and an operation she sadly pass away about year after her first symptom appear tilly be just four year old her father jonathan headteacher in my constituency be in the gallery he reach out to after read about the bill he explain his frustration that the development of new treatment for neuroblastoma have be move at glacial pace for too long the same be true for many other rare cancer this slow pace of change be not respect by these cancer and it mean that tilly miss her seventh birthday yesterday thank jonathan for share tilly story and wish he all the good as he move to northern ireland with tilly mum and big sister emily to start new job thank livingston team jak for their ongoing support for tilly family and many other neither jonathan nor want to suggest that the bill would have save tilly but we hope that it will improve survival rate for other and take they beyond the rate give to tilly that be why jonathan be here today and why be here today nobody tell that the most amazing thing about be an mp would be the people we meet almost daily who want to make their community our country or even the world well place that be particularly true of the people have be humble to meet on my journey to speak about the bill today include cancer patient survivor the bereaved and campaigner all of whom want just one thing justice although the healthcare system in the uk be found on the notion of equality fairness and justice they believe that rare cancer patient be be overlook their demand for justice cover three point the first be that beat rare cancer should not be less likely than beat other cancer have say that of all uk cancer diagnosis each year be of rare and less common type these patient already have the card stack against they as they be less likely to survive an injustice cause by the relative lack of research and development in this field over many year secondly have rare cancer should not mean be less likely to benefit from medical breakthrough accord to in an astonishing of patient with rare and less common cancer be not offer clinical trial and so be deny access to potentially lifesave treatment often that be because such trial do not even exist because there have be so little progress and when they do exist they be not always easy for patient to access let give an example there be remarkable young woman in my constituency know as kira the machine kira have be live with neuroblastoma since she be she have be through it all prognosis of inoperability round of chemotherapy and eight relapse she and her mum aud be fundraise legend locally do not know school or workplace in edinburgh that do not help when they be give just three week to raise for lifesave specialist treatment in the usa now and fundraise for other cancer sufferer kira be an example to we all she owe her life to lung cancer drug not typically provide to treat neuroblastoma and not yet generally available in the uk for that purpose although understand that solve kid cancer be work on that kira appear on my social medium so much and be really well know in edinburgh because of the fantastic campaign that she and her mum run she be bit of celebrity if can use that word she come into my office recently to talk about the bill it be really humble to meet she and because she have that celebrity status in my mind be also quite starstruck tell she that it be like taylor swift enter my office resist the temptation to exchange friendship bracelet with she but she give solving kids cancer badge which be proud to wear today kira story be important because it remind we that repurpose exist drug can unlock great benefit but those benefit can be deliver at scale only through additional medical research effort and clinical trial the nhs have drug repurposing office to date it have repurpose one drug and that be for breast cancer do my hon friend think that be good enough welcome that intervention think that be leading question of course it be not good enough do not think that anybody here think that it be good enough include the minister unfortunately at present there be very few clinical trial in this country for rare cancer treatment family such as kira should not need to crowdfund for treatment overseas we should be build the capacity here in the uk thirdly have rare cancer should not mean that diagnosis be delay when compare with diagnosis of other cancer rare cancer sufferer tell that their symptom be often less likely to be recognise as doctor be less familiar with they thank my hon friend for the powerful way he be introduce his bill my constituent steph be just year old and be mam to two little girl she be diagnose with grade glioblastoma know as astrocytoma on her birthday last year for month prior to her diagnosis she be treat for migraine by her gp steph know that she be not suffer from migraine yet she be rudely dismiss by an doctor and feel nobody be listen to she steph have since have brain surgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy my hon friend know that early diagnosis and treatment be vital can he assure steph and her family and that the bill will help to raise awareness across the medical profession of rare brain cancer absolutely last week attend reception for the eve appeal be really strike by the fact that early diagnosis be big feature of what the charity be talk about and will come on to that in just second as consequence of the lack of recognition of the symptom of rare cancer too many people be diagnose too late last week at an event host by the brain tumour charity meet gabrielle and her wife and child gabrielle tell how the neurologist to whom she be initially refer do not recognise her brain tumour symptom and tell she instead to go home breathe into paper bag and get some counselling if only cure brain tumour be so easy reflect on the comment make by my hon friend the member for south shields mrs lewell buck an observation that have make on this journey be that so many of the people who have talk about late diagnosis have be woman that be purely anecdotal but it seem to be the case when be at the eve appeal reception the point be make that so many woman be turn away the gp tell they that they be hormonal premenstrual or premenopausal my hon friend be make an incredibly important point with which many across the chamber will agree the statistic be particularly stark for woman from black asian and minority ethnic background they be even more likely to be dismiss thank my hon friend and office neighbour for make that point which be also make by eve appeal can not remember the statistic but there be stark difference talk about this issue when meet the minister yesterday and she gently point out to that it be not just in healthcare where woman be dismiss as hormonal premenstrual and so on thank she for remind of that in the gentlest possible way it be cruel irony that rare cancer such as gabrielle tumour be typically less survivable make early diagnosis even more important rare cancer patient require early not later diagnosis have speak about poor outcome lack of progress in develop treatment and late diagnosis my bill focus on the first two point but want to acknowledge the need to improve diagnosis because of comment that have already be make be sure that will feature in the cancer plan be the first to admit that when be successful in the private member bill ballot find it daunt as new mp think have some really good idea for bill but as soon as my ping pong ball be pick from the goldfish bowl be inundate with call from constituent charity and lobbyist each tell that their cause be well than any could think of consider many worthwhile cause over the follow day but while have coffee in colinton mains tesco in edinburgh south west receive email from member of the public who support the campaign of my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh just last week meet oriana one of the people who email it be incredibly move to meet she it take right back to the start of this journey post on my facebook page about meet she and straight away somebody say that they know she and that she have help they when their family have be face with glioblastoma that be reminder that so many people affect by these condition turn their loss into something really positive and help other people my hon friend campaign relate to glioblastoma type of tumour that take my father in law feel that the star have align for really do mean that really do get that feeling want to pay tribute to my hon friend hon member hear hear more more know she to be formidable woman who in this context be drive by glioblastoma take her sister margaret do not know her sister at all which be my loss but do know that she shape my party and she help change our country for the well and know above all that she be love by her sister glioblastoma be typical of so many rare cancer and it start on this journey so want to talk about it far my father in law ivor hutchison be dignified man but glioblastoma do not respect that he be technical teacher at bell baxter high school in fife he be married to sylvia and they have four daughter denise iona my lovely wife audrey who be in the gallery have just embarrass she and sarah in time ivor and sylvia have grandchild andrew our daughter ruth hannah matthew our son ben rory and sophie ivor be not passive grandfather he work hard to ensure his grandchild flourish in september ivor begin have problem with his speech my wife audrey an nhs nurse be concerned that it might be sign of dementia we all hop that that be not the case follow an mri scan in the november we receive the devastating news that ivor have glioblastoma at christmas he be still very much himself and enjoy the festivity ivor never have pound of fat on he but when it come to christmas time he really do hoover up the food and enjoy the christmas meal it be great to see he that christmas but we do feel that it would be his last once we enter the new year he begin to lose his mobility and eventually he be admit to adamson hospital in cupar in surround by his wife and daughter ivor die peacefully eight month after his first symptom he have good life and his daughter be fantastic legacy to he as well as all the pupil he teach at school however as physically fit man ivor should have live long he should have live to see his birthday last weekend and if he have do so he would not have miss two of his grandchild get marry and his first great grandchild fraya be bear in december last year assume that he have be unlucky with glioblastoma it be not until meet my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden that learn that only of glioblastoma patient live beyond month after diagnosis and only one in survive beyond five year despite that awful prognosis as for other rare cancer the drug to treat glioblastoma have not change in decade that be why know in my heart that need to introduce bill that would help equip those work hard to fight against glioblastoma and all rare cancer with the tool they need to further their effort and ultimately save life over the past year thank to the dedicated work of charity survivor and researcher we have see rise in survival rate for those diagnose with cancer globally new treatment be be develop and roll out to patient improve outcome and save life in our nhs every single day however rare cancer patient be be leave behind and need to explain why it be not due to lack of effort by charity or those affect by the disease in fact in the gallery today be member of some incredible charity who be fight against rare cancer in what be often an uphill battle thank they for their hard work in help to develop the bill they really have help which aim to address the injustice face by rare cancer patient and their family for all the people have meet from the charity their work be much more than job for they it be about make difference to people life improve survivability and support family the reason for the uphill battle be that research into rare cancer be much less appealing to pharmaceutical company when compare with more common condition with small patient population there be an increase logistical challenge in bring patient together currently we be lack sufficient development strategy and there be no single source of patient datum mean company must undertake the costly endeavour of find patient and verify eligibility even if they succeed in run clinical trial and drug prove to be an effective treatment company face the challenge of sell drug develop at great expense to small market ultimately these company exist to return profit for their shareholder give choice between investment in potential treatment for rare cancer or more common one too often rare cancer patient lose out have set out the challenge face by those diagnose with rare cancer let now address what the bill aim to accomplish will list four key measure and explain their impact appoint name responsible lead for the delivery of rare cancer research create single registry of rare cancer trial create single registry of rare cancer patient available for trial and define an evidence base for repurpose new cancer treatment let explain in turn why these be important first the bill would place duty on the secretary of state to facilitate and promote research relate to rare cancer patient the appointment of national specialty lead for rare cancer in the national institute of health and care research would provide the secretary of state with advice on the design and planning of research to facilitate collaboration between relevant party that will ensure co ordination and accountability for the delivery of new cancer research in the uk secondly the bill would increase access to clinical trial via service tailor to rare cancer patient through the secretary of state new duty that would be accomplish as part of the exist be part of research registry ensure that all trial be register in single place thirdly charity and clinician tell that more trial would be attract to the uk if we have easy access to patient cohort establish single database of willing patient would remove significant burden on researcher in find and verify eligible people for clinical trial congratulate the hon gentleman on introduce bill on this important subject he mention research can he explain why the extent of clause and be limit to england and wales what be happen in scotland in relation to the research issue the challenge be devolution be huge fan of devolution but often the uk be at its good when it work together particularly on healthcare hope that in time we will see progress and the nation will work together do not want to overstate this but there have be discussion across the uk about how we could work together on the issue so perhaps the answer be watch this space the bill fourth measure be to trigger review by the government of the orphan drug regulation to examine how they can be reform to well incentivise pharmaceutical company to invest in clinical trial for rare cancer specifically it will consider how incentive could be provide to pharmaceutical company to trial the repurposing of new cancer treatment we often hear about how drug development for one cancer can be use to defeat another that be what kira rely on right now my bill aim to build foundation for industrialise that approach via incentive the eu have similar system for incentivise the testing of drug for paediatric use that have already be approve for adult use so the approach have be try and test together these measure will ensure that we have leadership in government and will remove the barrier to run new clinical trial that researcher and pharmaceutical company face thank my hon friend for the powerful way in which he be introduce the bill will he recognise the work of pioneer team such as the one at charing cross hospital under imperial college healthcare nhs trust where professor michael seckl be lead the way in groundbreake treatment for and research on gestational trophoblastic disease and germ cell tumour do he agree that those centre need support to expand and share their research finding with the rest of the nhs absolutely there be fantastic expertise in our university across the uk as say that have to refer hon member to my register interest because of my connection with the university sector there be much more that we can do to attract the good researcher to the uk and build capacity in uk university the bill will provide great accountability for the delivery of new research but please do not just take my word for it brain tumour research have describe it as essential for brain tumour cure do not feel any pressure at all when read that quote no it be quite daunting to be honest the less survivable cancers taskforce say that the bill could be truly transformative moment in the uk approach to research for rare and less common cancer my friend at the brain tumour charity say that the bill be framework for tangible impactful change at this point have to mention my daughter connection with the brain tumour charity she be run marathon in may to raise funding for it and wish she well hon member hear hear thank you let list some of the other group that support the bill they include pancreatic cancer uk which have be absolutely fantastic in its support for what we be do an organisation that represent more than group the angel mums the grace kelly childhood cancer trust and the inflammatory breast cancer network uk inflammatory breast cancer account for of breast cancer diagnosis in the uk each year but of the death the bill be also support by target ovarian cancer brainstrust ammf the cholangiocarcinoma charity the urology foundation the tessa jowell brain cancer mission action kidney cancer and sarcoma uk which meet this week have friend with that cancer and it be fantastic organisation that hope to work more with in the future it be support by maggie shine cancer support solving kid cancer the british liver trust blood cancer uk radiotherapy uk leukaemia uk cclg the children and young people cancer association cll support neuroblastoma uk salivary gland cancer uk neuroendocrine cancer uk melanoma focus myeloma uk hope for tomorrow alike yorkshire cancer research young live vs cancer the tessa jowell foundation the uk mastocytosis support group the bone cancer research trust the neurosciences foundation and the eve appeal the eve appeal have fantastic reception last week and when go along to it have its support feel like real tipping point in the progress we be make in build support for the bill it be great to see the minister as well and have to say this be not trivial point that the cake there be absolutely fantastic do not doubt that when get back to my office and check my email more organisation will have get in touch to say that they want to support what we be do today know that many member in the chamber today will have deeply personal story to tell on their own behalf and on behalf of their constituent look forward to hear those testimony as we debate this bill because it be so important to give those people voice will conclude by say that the bill we be debate today have real chance of make difference for too long rare cancer patient have be leave on the sideline without significant advancement this can not go on tilly and ivor deserve well chance of beat the cancer inside they and those who be yet to be diagnose deserve well chance of full life let we pass this bill today and work across the uk to take the fight to rare cancer and save life commend this bill to the house rise before call the first speaker be aware that this be very personal debate for some member so please feel free to leave the chamber if you need to let look after each other today congratulate the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur both on his good fortune in be draw in the private member bill ballot and on his wisdom in pick this very important issue to take forward have be similarly lucky in be draw in that ballot few week after be first elect nearly decade ago know the barrage of call and email that suddenly come your way the very sudden and slightly fleeting popularity that come from come towards the top of the private member bill ballot and the very many very worthy cause and campaign that come your way for you to choose between the hon gentleman could not have pick well cause than the one represent by this bill and if he be never again quite as popular as he be in the few hour after the publication of the ballot result know that he would willingly exchange all of that popularity in an instant for the difference that this legislation can make to so many life across the country if and when it be pass and implement as we hope it will be stand today not just as member of this house but as friend who be deeply move by the pain of see someone care about someone who have become like family struggle against an insidious disease this bill be not just another piece of legislation it be cry for help it be plea for those who be fight for their life lifeline for family who be watch their love one slip away bit by bit and day after day too often those diagnose with rare cancer be leave strand in system that do not have the answer they need we know the wonder that pharmaceutical company can do in drug development but the horrible truth be that few people be able or willing to invest the enormous amount of money need to take forward drug development know that about one in drug candidate make it to market for condition that will require that drug or time year at most do the hon gentleman agree that there be whole range of new modern immunotherapy drug that could be use on these cancer they already exist they be use to treat other people but they be simply not try the cost of those trial be not overwhelming and we can do they and the nhs repurposing project should be do they the hon lady be obviously right and know that she approach this subject with tragically huge amount of personal experience we have already see drug in some case long market drug be apply for new purpose and new condition without those costly clinical trial they will not be license or approve for prescription and that be why the bill be so important clinical trial be sadly distant hope for far too many currently and many patient be leave with the crushing gut wrench word there be nothing more we can do those word can be death sentence but they do not have to be not if we act many members and house staff will know my senior parliamentary assistant and dear friend dan horrocks he be well know as the owner of bella his therapy shih tzu who he have while he be be treat for his third brain tumour and who be often see roam around the palace and parliament street dan have work for since be first elect in but he be not just my senior parliamentary assistant he have become like family he be father husband and four time cancer survivor for year he have fight this monster each time feel the ground slip more from under he as his option narrow leave he and his family with ever reduce hope we have see he face unimaginable pain have watch he endure brain surgery and radiotherapy and see the fear in his eye each time the disease come back and he hear his doctor tell he that they do not know how much more his body can take and whether he can be put through that next course of radiotherapy dan journey start with something as simple as headache as the hon member for edinburgh south west refer to in another case that no one thought be serious at the time as teenager three gps all misdiagnose that tumour and for unknown reason the gps do not want to send dan for scan simple scan to check that there be no malign cause would have identify those tumour month early it be free voucher for an eye test that save dan life because it be not until by sheer luck an optician notice something wrong in his eye that anyone realise the nightmare he be live that optician save his life what follow have be nothing short of nightmare brain tumour surgery radiotherapy and the heart wrench hope that every treatment might be the last only for the disease to rear its ugly head again now the cancer have spread to his spine his doctor and consultant have no answer his option be dwindle yet dan fight be far from over because dan be not just fight for himself but for his two year old son elijah who deserve to grow up with his father by his side cheer he on at his first football match and guide he through life milestone dan dream of walk his son to school every day and of be there for every moment that really matter whether it be his graduation or his wedding the moment that every parent should have the chance to see he be fight with his wife sonia who have be his rock through all of this sonia have stay by his side through every hospital visit through every sleepless night and through every moment of doubt and fear together they have dream of life grow old together of watch their child grow up and of building memory that will last forever but that future be slip away that be why we be here today to ensure that no parent no family no child have to face the horror of rare cancer without hope this bill be not just about change law or regulation it be about give family like dan fighting chance it mandate review of the orphan drug regulation to ensure that rare cancer get the investment they so desperately need create the national specialty lead to drive research and innovation and establish registry service to help to connect patient to the clinical trial that really could save their life this bill give hope real chance for family who be face the unimaginable stand here today with heart full of hope but also with heavy heart because know that time be not on their side dan do not have the luxury of wait his family do not have the luxury of wait no one diagnose with rare cancer have that luxury that be why this bill be so very urgent we spend lot of time in this chamber talk about politic but this be not about politic it be about real people like dan who desperately need our help cancer do not care about politic it do not care what background we come from our age or gender or what party we belong to it strike indiscriminately it take what it want and it leave devastation in its wake that be why we must respond with urgency with compassion and most importantly with action strongly support this bill and urge all hon member here today to stand with we to stand with the family cling to the hope that there be something more we can do and to stand with those like dan who be fight for more time for more moment for more chance to hold their love one close the cost of inaction be measure not just in money but in precious life lose let we pass this bill let we give people like dan and his family the hope they so desperately need let we give they future future that be still within reach rise to speak about bill that will increase research funding focus on more effective treatment for rare form of cancer thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce the bill like many in this house rise today because have lose family member to rare cancer and also rise as member of the health and social care committee in the last parliament the committee conduct future cancer inquiry which recommend that the uk should be lead on drive up international action to tackle the poor outcome for the least survivable and least common cancer this bill will do that but as say my reason for speak in this debate be much more personal on january this year my brother alex english pass away from high grade acinic cell carcinoma form of salivary gland cancer tell his story to highlight what we can win because this bill can give family the gift of more time with the special people they love increasingly more common cancer be treatable or be illness that people can live with but on rare cancer we still have way to go and without focus we will not get any far there be more than diagnosis of various form of salivary gland cancer each year but my search for related term in hansard find only two mention in this chamber in the past year my hon friend have just make the third one of those mention be from follow my brother death that be why we need more focus in evidence to that select committee inquiry note that while they represent of diagnosis of less common cancer rare cancer account for of death member across this house have our own cancer journey ourselves our friend or our loved one and want to talk about my brother journey not all cancer journey have the outcome that we want and even with this bill we will still lose some people but more investment into research for rare cancer can give we something crucial time would do anything for more time with my brother if you will indulge madam deputy speaker would like to talk for minute about the person who alex be the most important thing about alex be not how he die it be how he live and the mark he leave on the world he fit lot into year lot of we think that our eld sibling be rock star but in my brother case that be literally true the band he join at university call pure tour with band like soundgarden and reach the top in japan have always be tremendously proud to call he my brother be proud of the horse draw narrowboat company he run in hebden bridge which form part of many people happy childhood memory and of his subsequent time at the national trust where he help property to become profitable work to restore nature and work with local authority his last major project be create woodland near lunt in liverpool but most of all be proud of the person he be he be always funny he have surreal wit he be unfailingly kind and the sort of non toxic model of masculinity that the world need more of remember the humour and love in the good man speech he give for and will never not be sorry that have write eulogy for my brother but never good man speech while prepare for christmas in get call from alex and he ask if have minute to talk which be unlike he because he would not generally be over serious he say he have lump on the side of his face that be in his word unsightly but not overly concern it might have be cancer but there be number of other thing that it could have be and if it be cancer it be likely to be very treatable form he instruct to be aware of it but not make big deal of it because typically he do not want to worry our mum later it transpire that it be acinic cell carcinoma but the prognosis be good and they be go to operate the cancer continue to grow his operation take hour the thing about alex tumour be that the version of the illness he have be high grade which mean that it mutate fast it be something that have only be identify in about case and which no doubt could have be identify early have we know more about cancer like his last spring in my mum garden during hush conversation with different family member to the side they tell that alex might only have month to live hug my two year old son who be play in the garden unaware because be try not to make big deal of it but sometimes you need to hug someone every update get bad until take day off during the election campaign to visit he at the christie hospital because his lung have collapse then because it be never straight line his health improve he get to sit up there in the gallery to watch my maiden speech in parliament we go to pixies concert together at the piece hall in halifax then he get bad madam deputy speaker and on christmas eve last year he be hospitalise again when he return home we know he be come home to die can not say enough about his wonderful friend particularly matt and sarah and my incredible family who care for he at the end all of we would have spend more time at his bedside if we could because time with people you love be privilege that be what this bill be about give people more time with those they love perhaps even full lifetime together in case where the cancer be bad and it can not be treat or cure it be about give people more time well health and an understanding of the journey that they be on it be about give people more special moment be it pixies concert or read story to child alex read the good story and time to organise what you leave behind people who develop cancer that be rare still matter and they still deserve more time the work to help people like alex in the future must start today the government have renew emphasis on tackle rare cancer in memory of the sister of my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and of tessa jowell and for countless other campaigner include those in the gallery what we need be focus and determination to respond quickly thank the house for indulge today let we be that world leader that be so desperately need in tackle rare cancer let we give family special time with those they love the most let we pass this bill thank the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for bring the bill before the house and pay tribute to he and to the hon member who have already speak so movingly on this subject include the hon member for calder valley josh fenton glynn also pay tribute to the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for her tireless advocacy the many form of cancer categorise as rare accord to the bill might each strike small number of people but take together rare cancer make up almost one in five of all cancer diagnosis each incident each diagnosis each prognosis have the same devastating impact on family throughout the country my own be no exception my brother in law group captain pip harding who be be diagnose with stage glioblastoma this time last year at the time he be serve in the royal air force with the us indo pacific command one of his many tour include in afghanistan and iraq he be give nine to month to live for his wife claire and his five child the news change everything in september join pip his family and over other love one at raf benson in oxfordshire for what be call dining out or farewell ceremony an event to allow everyone to be together with pip potentially for one last time you can imagine how difficult yet how move that be few week later pip be lucky enough to come across the pioneer brain surgeon dr paul mulholland who have be trialle treatment call oncothermia this employ radio frequency to target and heat malignant cancer tumour cell while avoid healthy cell oncothermia be not currently available on the nhs and each one hour treatment cost tumour like pip require session for most people indeed for almost all of we that kind of money and consequently that course of care be out of reach but the friend and family who attend pip farewell dinner set up gofundme page which be now cover the cost of the treatment we love pip which be why we all put in as much as we could to fund it cancer like this with brutal and bleak prognosis bring people together to fight it want the government to share that resolve since start the monthly oncothermia session in december the first mri scan show that pip brain tumour have reduce in size from cm to cm pip be thank god still alive and watch today european study now suggest that oncothermia can extend life for four to five year for pip five child that time be everything but that be not the whole of my experience with glioblastoma in my husband john good friend ian die from the disease his widow nicola be in the gallery almost unbelievably nicola sister karen who have do so much to help nicola through the loss of ian be herself diagnose with stage glioblastoma last year and die few month later know that other in the chamber and in the gallery have have their life touch by glioblastoma too be sure they will agree that in the past three decade there have be an unacceptable lack of progress make on this disease lack of progress in develop new treatment make they widely accessible and keep those diagnose with glioblastoma here with their love one in the past year cancer survival rate in the uk have double whereas in the only of those diagnose be expect to live year today over half do that be record of staggering success and represent countless life extend make rich and full and even save when it come to glioblastoma however there be far less to celebrate the chance of live decade with the disease be one in the gain in life expectancy over recent decade can be measure in month precious yes but not nearly enough glioblastoma be rare cancer but also an exceptionally lethal one brain tumour be the big cancer killer of child and of adult under the age of yet in recent year glioblastoma have be apportion only around to of uk cancer funding in to honour dame tessa jowell the government announce doubling of funding for research into brain tumour but six year later it be widely report that less than half of the pledge million have actually be spend during each of those year as funding be be delay and sluggishly deploy more than people in the uk be diagnose with glioblastoma will the government update the house on how the remain fund have be and be be spend will the minister assure that as the national cancer plan be develop alongside the nhs year plan deliberate and specific consideration will be give to glioblastoma the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency incentivise research on orphan drug grant exclusivity for manufacturer and make it cheap to bring drug to market once they be develop but clearly when it come to glioblastomas it have not have adequate success have be to see the mhra numerous time and have ask about repurpose drug many pharmaceutical company be worried about repurpose drug the fear be that if glioblastoma research be to affect the main cause for have the drug that might make the drug less successful we have beseech the mhra to treat glioblastoma separately would the hon lady support such move would of course support such move and urge the government to listen and take action get it right on glioblastoma be vital despite minor breakthrough exciting innovation and apparently promise research lead for this disease there have simply not be the improvement in survival rate that most cancer have have to put it bluntly glioblastoma remain death sentence an increasingly common one in the uk cancer diagnosis have increase but although there be some worry sub theme this trend be largely due to increase life expectancy however that be not the case with glioblastoma in the past year rate in the uk have more than double there have be far more of an uptick than be attributable to we all live long more people be develop this disease yet we have fail to make meaningful stride on treatment and cure or even on give those with glioblastoma little more time with those dearest to they now be the moment to do something about that welcome the bill welcome its emphasis on improve research have already touch on drug development and the provision to facilitate clinical trial because the grim reality be that for glioblastoma those trial be hard to conduct there be too few patient and frequently their life expectancy be too limited anything that can be do to connect eligible patient with researcher fast and with less friction be valuable emphasise that there be great opportunity in front of we for accelerate research and make broad advance in the battle against rare cancer along with almost half my parliamentary colleague be proud to have pledge my support for the lobular moon shot project which advocate boost of around million over five year for research on the basic biology of invasive lobular breast cancer with view to develop new treatment despite be the second most common form of breast cancer lobular breast cancer be in many way treat like rare cancer it be under research difficult to diagnose through the standard screening mammogram and often present few symptom than invasive ductal carcinoma which make up the overwhelming majority of breast cancer incident as the hon lady be explain very well invasive lobular breast cancer be not class as rare cancer be concerned that it would not come within the scope of this bill so gently ask if it could be widen at the next stage as she say lobular breast cancer have many characteristic of rare cancer thank the hon gentleman for that intervention yes lobular breast cancer be treat in many way like rare disease recently meet my constituent kate who be diagnose with lobular breast cancer in she explain to that because almost all breast cancer research be base on the ductal variant woman like she be diagnose later and often receive treatment orient towards cancer with different biology from lobular cancer those two factor result in high recurrence and low survival rate kate have be in remission for more than year and have become an advocate for research on her behalf ask the minister whether she have meet with the lobular moon shot campaigner what step be the government take to increase research into the cancer what consideration have she give to update guideline for the national institute for health and care excellence to encourage the use of mri to diagnose lobular breast cancer early the moon shot idea be the right one in fight cancer we should set ambitious goal and we should innovate until we meet they moreover as the apollo project show research into seemingly narrow thing often have spillover effect produce vast unanticipated benefit that be often true when it come to orphan drug to take just one example gleevec have change the game and not just for one rare form of leukaemia it be now use to treat range of other cancer and condition the british pharmaceutical development sector be exceptionally strong and now be moment of potential on genome mapping artificial intelligence biotech immunotherapy and cancer vaccine the uk be in position to transform and save life recognise the limited scope of the bill but believe it to be vital this house must take keen interest in accelerate and incentivise research into rare cancer include glioblastoma this legislation meaningfully advance that goal will speak briefly about young people and child and specifically lovely girl call maddie cowey at the age of maddie be diagnose with an alveolar soft part sarcoma sarcoma be an uncommon cancer that can occur anywhere in the body all cancer in someone of maddie age be consider rare but in her case the classification be ultra rare partly in consequence it take five month for she to receive diagnosis maddie have just start university she recall that at the time it feel like my life be fall apart in many way it be and it do it be very lonely place maddie be diagnose almost year ago now there be no approve treatment for maddie type of rare cancer and she be undergo clinical trial it be likely that she will remain on treatment for life maddie be amazing she be brave and she will not let cancer define she bring up her story because cancer in young people be so uncommon that often it be diagnose later neither medical professional nor young people expect it but the later diagnosis come the more likely the cancer be to be lethal what step be the government take to ensure that the rare cancer afflict young people be catch early finally be remind of something that emily dickinson once write about hope ve hear it in the chill land and on the strange sea we must get this right we must give sufferer hope we owe that to pip family his wife claire and his five child and to nicola in the gallery and she and ian son adam and oliver and to so many other who have suffer and who be here with we believe that we can through you madam deputy speaker want to apologise to the young black man on the northern line tube from colliers wood this morning for have to spend his journey look at sob my heart out it must have be very odd experience want to say to he be not just sad be angry be angry at the nhs be angry at the mhra be angry beyond belief at the national institute for health research it should be rename the national institute for something that do not do very much at great public expense all these institution be bedevil by the desire to carry on do what they have always do it do not get they sack as the former home secretary john reid lord reid constantly tell siobhan nobody ever get sack for continue to do the same thing you be only sack if you do something different my god have this morning not tell we that we need to do something different we have the tool to do something different but the people in position of power and responsibility choose not to we have the good health system in the world for potential drug trial uniform system with well train doctor great scientist great university and great hospital but do we do they no do we fail people every single day yes do we threaten those doctor who try to do something different let tell the house groundbreake oncologist be look over their shoulder wait for the regulator to come and get they when one of their colleague grass they up that be the atmosphere in our intellectual and health service institution could feel sorry for myself and for my loss but do not want that want thing to change all of we from all party need to run fast and break thing and provide challenge to the people run our system we have drug repurposing project in the most universal health system in the world so why be we not repurpose drug for people with rare cancer why be that not be do for glioblastoma why be it that in may we will open drug trial at university college london and university college london hospitals trust in margaret memory to trial one such drug that have be in the system for year we organise dinner with former prime minister tony blair some run marathon and other sell cake and scone in beautiful cornwall village do those thing give we great deal but why under our system do we have to do they why be it that the trial in may under the amazing paul mulholland will be base in only one trust it be because if we have negotiate with all the other hospital trust that be expert in this field it would have take we two year to get start why be we outstrip by israel spain america and any number of country it be because we can not get our act together to start trial as each hospital trust be argue about and seek to renegotiate every trial and every plan this be not new the issue be raise by lord in his great report on clinical trial that report be two year old but we have make no progress we make no progress under the former conservative government and we have make no progress under our government the million give to the national institute for health and care research in for glioblastoma and brain cancer drug trial have not be spend can any member of the house explain to how that be humanly possible do we not have drug that we could trial yes of course we do trial be not that complicated we can do they if we choose to we have the doctor to do they we need to want to change apologise to the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend the member for west lancashire ashley dalton because when she come to talk to in the tea room this morning she get this at very fast pace have now meet four wonderful cancer ministers two conservative and two labour they have all be dedicate and all want to sort this out but we can not do this by edict or by hop and wish unless we change thing and unless dare say some people be remove it will never happen all the institution mention continue to exist because they do not do thing differently someone diagnose with glioblastoma will get the same treatment that they would have get year ago they will have their tumour remove they will be delighted that it be go but it be not go it be come back they will be give eight week radiotherapy it be brutal it will help they for while but the tumour will come back then they get give chemotherapy the drug be temozolomide which be approve at the beginning of the it will help but the tumour will come back they have to be able to withstand that drug themselves margaret could not do that by march five month on from her diagnosis she could not take it her kidney collapse what happen then we have money and good friend at this point would like publicly to thank lord waheed alli for the kindness and friendship he show we through margaret journey the treatment that he have experience from the press be absolutely appalling he help we on our way but what about somebody with no money who can not fundraise their life end at the chemotherapy there be nothing on the nhs but those lucky enough to have the money can find way be really grateful that the brother in law of the hon member for esher and walton monica harding be on the oncotherapy machine my sister fundraise for that machine because we have to go to dusseldorf to have it so we bring it here it be great that he be receive much benefit from it know that many other people be too why be the nhs which be so risk averse that it will not allow slightly alternative therapy for cancer happy for people who be really ill to get on plane and go to different country be it because it do not see what happen in another country so that be okay have tell the story of hold my sister head as she be sick in bucket in terminal at heathrow airport of carry she on to plane in the hope that the air stewardess would not see how she be of lie next to she overnight hop that she would be alive in the morning because what be go to do in hotel in germany where could not speak that language that be my experience but be only one of thousand and thousand of people who do this every year include child because our system will not allow the use of novel treatment why why can we change thing why do we get up every single day and want to cure something do not know about other hon member but since join the labour party and since become an mp in have get up every day and hop that we could make thing well in some way do not understand why our system do not want to do the same thing want to understand but it be beyond if there be drug that could cure or give long life to people with glioblastoma why do we trial they that be not beyond our ability we have the money to do it if we do not have the money we will raise it we just need the opportunity do not know why we do not have that wish to achieve be give some hope yesterday by the propose abolition of nhs england because something need to change do not know whether that be the right or wrong thing to do but we need to liberate people to do thing let we face it in the end only people who be well motivated and willing to take risk can change thing beyond that people will continue to die will continue have to go to other country will continue have to spend large amount of money people not lucky enough to be in that position will just die prematurely thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce the bill and for the courtesy he have always show which must have be difficult at time as sit shout at he in portcullis house about how everything be useless and hopeless in my calm moment understand that progress begin with small step be frustrate that those step be too small be delighted that there will be one database for trial but if there be no trial the database do not get we very far we will have report on the orphan drug act in month time in that period over people will have be diagnose with glioblastoma and many of they will have die why be it go to take we month why can we change thing now why in spite of the huge support we have have for the bill from the secretary of state for health could we not get something much more fierce in it it be not criticism it be an observation know progress begin slowly and be grateful for my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west take up the bill and for have the calm demeanour that lack because do not think the whips would have accept anything that would have come up with as private member bill we need revolutionary attitude we either see and harness progress or we come back next year the year after and the year after that to ask why there have be no progress all of we individually and communally need to dedicate ourselves to that progress and to keep ask the question be angry and simply refuse to accept that nothing can be do thank the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton because have enjoy work with they on the bill we all have our own story should state my personal interest my sister georgie be sit in the gallery she be diagnose with gbm glioblastoma multiforme nearly two year ago would like to say that she be alive and well but let just say that she be alive and she be do well she have be brave determined and an inspiration to we all it be particularly painful as she be mother of three wife daughter and sister we have lot to focus on and it be on we collectively will not rehash too much and will try to resist have cry but it might be difficult our action and what we do as team be what we will be judge on be go to throw it over to the labour side little because they be in government now and they have more power than we do in opposition when we leave the chamber today ask each government mp to ask okay what be we actually go to do the talk in this chamber be nice but it be the action that count will pick up on two point the first be the trial register we have first hand experience with georgie of try to find what trial be out there obviously there be not enough trial we know that and that be something we need to fix also match patient with trial be not rocket science that be basic thing would also encourage the government rather than just start from scratch and take month to reinvent the wheel to find out what be go on in the private sector and what trial and register of people seek trial be already out there and to build on that if there be partnership with some company that be fine but let we move quickly because speed really count the second point be about orphan drug regulation key trigger for get into politic be brexit think it be disastrous idea and still do struggle to find any possible gain from brexit but there be one thing that we could do the eu have regulation on orphan drug our could be more generous we could pull research into the uk by give patent for few extra year which would encourage people to dig into the research in these critical area live in hope of that one potential gain even if product be obtain reimbursement have to be accessible on the nhs which be far from certain ensure that there be robust timely and accessible route to make these drug available on the nhs for patient really count it be critical that that do not fall off the radar also we be really fall behind in the number of clinical researcher active in the uk today if we want to get this research move we must think about what we be do to get clinical researcher work hard in this space and in other because we be not do good enough job on that that be all will say let just return to my first point we need action it be good to have those in the gallery here today thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for bring the bill to the house and join he in pay tribute to our hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for her campaigning and for her powerful speech call for revolution in attitude also thank my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn for his very moving speech as somebody who lose brother much too young be deeply move by his word have come here today to speak on behalf of my constituent katie swinburne she be much love school teacher in fact she be the school teacher of one of my staff and mother of three who be diagnose with invasive lobular breast cancer as be mention moment ago lobular breast cancer be not class as rare cancer in fact it be the second most common type of breast cancer in the world with diagnosis annually in the uk alone but it share many characteristic of rare cancer in the sense that it be very difficult to detect in katie case as in many other it do not initially form as lump in the breast for example it have distinct genetic so be not detectable in genetic test and it be very easily miss in mammogram and ultrasound as consequence many of the woman who get this form of cancer will not be diagnose until long after it have already spread be also tell thankfully katie be watch today receive whatsapp message from she moment before speak that key point that should make to the minister be that because lobular breast cancer present differently from other form of breast cancer and be not separate out in clinical trial there be very little trial datum on it meet recently on zoom with katie and other who have be campaign for the moonshot this be not lot of money it be simply million of funding that the university of manchester could use to well understand the biological architecture of this type of cancer that would lead to the possibility of develop the right treatment because it currently have no specific treatment this be gentle request really that in the next stage of the bill lobular breast cancer be consider alongside the rare cancer for which it already provide finish by pay tribute to katie and all the many brave individual have meet can not imagine what it be like to be young and have parenting responsibility and be diagnose with an advanced stage of cancer many of those campaign know that they might not live to see the day when the well drug and treatment be available but they be bravely take up this cause on behalf of those who come after they katie be bravely do mile day sponsor walk my predecessor in this place join she on one of those mile and although we disagree about many thing politically we have already see today that this be cause that unite because there be little in fact there be nothing more precious in life for any of we than time spend with the people we love money can not buy that nothing can buy that and as my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden make clear the decision we make in this place can have real impact in the life of other have to say madam deputy speaker that as be wait to speak be very pleased that you do not call after the hon member for calder valley josh fenton glynn because do not think would have be able to get through part of my speech so shortly after listen to his story he do really well be diagnose with breast cancer in which be relatively unusual for man and the hard thing ever have to do be tell my two daughter who be and at the time about my diagnosis it be an experience that leave wonder if our family of four be about to become family of three have to explain to all of they that would have an operation to remove tumour and might need another one as thing turn out my cancer have spread and do need to have another operation also have to say that would need chemotherapy and radiotherapy and that that be go to take nine month out of our life not just mine but the life of my immediate family my wide family and our friend consider myself very lucky that my treatment pathway be relatively clear but that be not the case for many rare cancer the reach of cancer be an evil that be grow across our society with nearly one in two of we project to get cancer in our lifetime mean we all know someone close to we whether family or friend who will begin what can be very traumatic journey it be fight that cause your life to be take completely out of your hand and that leave family force to hear rarely use term like malignant or metastasise as if they be common expression cloud the horror of medical jargon it be with these word that be proud to associate myself with the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur and congratulate he on his campaign that demand well for cancer patient and especially on bring forward the rare cancers bill because it be powerful and necessary step forward to end the experience that describe at the beginning of my speech rare cancer be often under research and the regulatory environment simply fail to cope with they they have small patient population which make research and investment less appealing and an evidence base hard to achieve where clinical trial be take place patient often do not know very much about they survey of rare cancer patient find that cite not know about trial as the main barrier to access the trial in the first place the bill seek to rectify those flaw in our system and would like to highlight the power it contain to ensure that patient can get well access and find relevant clinical trial as be highlight in the teenage cancer trust improve young people access to cancer clinical trials report it be also difficult for the clinical trial lead themselves to find the necessary patient mean that they struggle to recruit both patient and researcher want to be in those clinical trial but the system do not allow for that common sense join up hope that as result of the change make by the bill people in my constituency of wokingham and across england will begin to see shift towards prioritise rare cancer because such shift be long overdue last week meet constituent to discuss his wife cancer she have leiomyosarcoma which have an incidence rate of six case per million people annually in the uk he explain to that one of the potential treatment option for his wife be exploit fault in the gene through parp inhibitor however with an estimate new case of leiomyosarcoma every year and only three with the mutation there be too few patient to allow for sufficient clinical trial and therefore nice do not license those drug for that particular cancer what be the minister view on effort within the european union life science industry to develop clear guidance to make cross border clinical trial easy if that be to happen it would address one of the major problem with rare cancer such as leiomyosarcoma individual nation may not have sufficient pool of patient to conduct clinical trial but multiple nation work together could do the minister see cross nation trial as have great potential for development in oncology if the eu be to advance easy cross border co operation would that be something that the united kingdom could potentially negotiate its way into this be no time for government to be isolationist my constituent also highlight that parp inhibitor be available in the united states what effort be the minister make to ask that if drug be approve by the united states food and drug administration nice have the opportunity to take the us evidence into account when consider whether to approve licence for drug in the uk sarcoma be just one tumour type that have poor survival outcome and limited treatment option despite the investment by charity such as sarcoma uk to fund research into new treatment we do not know enough about the disease because so few people be affect other constituent have write in to share their experience of lose love one to brain tumour such as glioblastomas and to blood cancer all have express hope that this bill will create world in which we can well encourage pharmaceutical company to run trial on rare cancer in order to create innovative new treatment so that the pain they go through will not be fate that other must endure in future before conclude it would be miss opportunity if do not ask the minister about the national cancer strategy which will be so important in ensure that long term plan be in place to deliver well service for patient with rare and less common cancer the nhs need to be prepare for the innovation of the future by prepare for an increase in demand for companion diagnostic the turnaround time for exist test be already cause delay in optimal treatment what step be the minister take to ensure that there be enough capacity for the ever increase demand for diagnostic test the national cancer strategy need to be thoroughly scrutinise before its final draft be publish to ensure that the measure demand by cancer charity and patient group and idea from by the life science sector be properly cover nhs performance must be measure regularly over the lifetime of the strategy to see if improvement be actually be make will the minister explain what accountability mechanism be be consider for the national cancer strategy thank the hon member for edinburgh south west once again for bring the bill to the house rise to support my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur know he have put huge amount of effort into bring the bill before the house in collaboration with many other include patient family professional and charity send my condolence to he his wife and family on the death of his father in law and to tilly family to lose child be unbearable and against the natural order of thing the bill be much need and welcome the opportunity to make some observation about it before do so refer to my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn and his brother live in the area of lunt that he refer to where there be go to be remarkable legacy for his brother the area have be rewilde and there will be forest there in due course which be absolutely fantastic invite he and his family to come down will show they around and they can see the legacy that his brother have leave we also want to refer to comment make by the chief executive officer of the brain tumour charity dr michele afif about the context of the bill and why it be before the house in an online article last month she write during my clinical career be frequently move by the courage and determination of my patient and their family it behove all of we to support the endeavour of my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west to help those people who do have voice as dr afif say by give our unambiguous backing to what she call bill of hope we must ensure that that hope be turn into reality that be the job of every member in the chamber we owe it to those affect by rare cancer to champion their need treatment and life the propose legislation would be starting point first base it will enable and facilitate the promotion of research into rare cancer and well access to clinical trial as have be say and initiate review of marketing authorisation for so call orphan product which will explore in more detail it be devastating to have cancer diagnosis we all know family member who have be diagnose with one form or another the shock and trauma that come with such news be hard to take in as the hon member for wokingham clive jones say but then to find out subsequently that the spectrum of intervention with medicine or other ally intervention be limited because of the rare nature of particular cancer surely add to that distress and worry as the hon member for esher and walton monica harding and my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh say with glioblastoma question inevitably sweep through the mind of those affect as to whether an appropriate medicinal intervention be available or even on the horizon orphan product be those drug that be use to treat not only rare cancer but other rare disease the pharmaceutical industry be reluctant to develop the drug because of the cost time and effort when they will not be commercially productive give the number of people who will use they the fact that these potentially lifesaving or life change drug be not produce leave significant lacuna in the treatment option for those with rare cancer although there be public health need of that there be absolutely no doubt there be no resource to enable that lacuna to be fill that resource should be make available be therefore pleased that clause of the bill will place duty on the secretary of state for health and social care to undertake review of the law relate to marketing authorisation for potential orphan medicine note that the bill will require an assessment of regulatory approach in other country which be also welcome that be an excellent and much need step in the right direction link in with the other requirement in the bill relate to research programme and initiative it send clear and unambiguous message to those affect and those who will be affect that could be anybody in this chamber and as we have hear it be some people in this chamber that the government have hear what they have say and be not only listen to that message and that plea but be take practical action to put it into effect which be more than welcome other country have introduce similar legislation in this respect the provision in clause will help to form more progressive informed approach and its requirement will enable information practice and protocol from other jurisdiction to be harvest for example genetic alliance uk point out that there be as many as rare disease possibly more affect one in people with approve treatment available for only one in rare disease more generally although those be not significant cohort of people per se in particular disease category collectively million of people be affect in one fashion or another by rare disease include rare cancer and it be no less the case for rare cancer disease be disease and those affect by it whether it be rare or not be entitle to equity of care and intervention in this case such potential intervention can not simply be leave to market arrangement that be why it be important to facilitate more comprehensive approach to the development of orphan medicine which must be set against the context of for example survey of orphan medicine that receive eu approval between and of those orphan medicine be make available in england compare with in germany in italy in france and in spain while those medicine do not specifically relate to cancer that help to contextualise the difference in number for orphan medicine research programme between and at the university of sheffield fund by the wellcome trust indicate furthermore only third of eu authorise orphan drug be recommend by nice thus the medical need of uk rare disease patient be potentially underserve compare to both the usa and eu indeed the programme be call the orphanisation project clearly as the university put it there be major international debate currently ongoing about how we might improve patient access to orphan drug raise important question about how to value these medicine and the ethic of resource allocation the project set out path for be creative in progress the relatively new concept of orphanisation as way of understand contemporary change in the biopharmaceutical sector specifically the project examine the extent to which orphanisation occur in the eu uk and usa and seek to understand how it be inform by different technology institution and actor address the implication for industry health policy and patient look forward to the progress that it will make believe that the proposal in the bill will help they follow through systemically and consistently to change that scenario for the well international exploration and comparison be one method to inform decision maker about how they can be more proactive in facilitate access to medicine for those most in need of they especially when the size and extent of the available medicinal range be limited that be often the case with the rare cancer we be talk about and rare disease more generally once again thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west for enable the house to debate this issue and for the opportunity to tease out many of the issue affect our constituent and as refer to early to discuss crucial lifesaving and life enhance treatment for disease more generally again pay tribute to all those colleague who have bring their story and their experience to we today include my hon friend the members for calder valley and for mitcham and morden the hon member for wokingham and for witney charlie maynard and other they deserve our admiration and thank but more importantly they need our support to get the job do that point have be make by so many such exposition however painful for the members concerned bring home the real need for this house to act on this issue which be literally matter of life and death finally look forward to see the bill progress through the house in the come week as no doubt do many other thank you madam deputy speaker for your indulgence be here today to support the rare cancers bill vital piece of legislation introduce by our hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur begin by pay tribute to his father in law and all those who have share their story here today my hon friend story like so many be stark reminder of how aggressive and under research cancer can be leave patient with little or no hope it be assume that rare cancer as have be mention today affect low number of people but that be not the case cancer research uk say that rare and less common cancer account for of all uk cancer diagnosis and of all cancer relate death some of rare cancer patient be never even consult about join clinical trial that mean that while each individual rare cancer may affect relatively few people together they make up almost half of cancer case yet the funding and research remain disproportionately low will briefly mention charlie shrager one of my constituent in gravesham like so many she be fight cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct cancer it be supposedly rare but devastating form of liver cancer and there be rise incidence in out of people be diagnose with it in it be some of these patient be diagnose at stage or stage mean that their likelihood of survival be limited histotripsy be non invasive treatment that use sonic beam therapy it be incredible the problem be that we do not have machine in the uk they cost million and let we get one here because for people face this disease or pancreatic cancer it be lifesaver and they desperately need it as charlie put it be lucky enough to afford treatment abroad but know many who be they do have that option why should their chance depend on their bank balance we must recognise that rare do not mean insignificant people across the uk be battle cancer that remain underfunded under research and underserve by clinical trial which be criminal it be pattern that be repeat again and again with bile duct cancer glioblastoma leiomyosarcoma rare soft tissue cancer that demand personalise medicine pancreatic cancer and blood cancer each of these cancer devastate live we have discuss what the bill can do appoint national specialty lead for rare cancer review and improve the uk orphan drug regulation and improve data sharing as research scientist in biochemistry work on neglect infectious disease and come across the drug for neglected diseases initiative it be launch year ago to co ordinate research outcome negotiate with big pharma and test drug that have be develop for other neglect disease and it be now eliminate disease across the globe it can be do we have the blueprint so urge the minister to reach out to that initiative to see what we can learn and implement here for too long rare and neglect cancer have mean rare chance of survival and that must change give the strength of feeling among everybody here there be the will to bring about change look forward to see the bill go forward and to see that people be not leave behind and that we find cure for everybody we have already hear so much move and powerful testimony in this debate but despite the tragic impact that rare cancer have on people across the uk they garner too little attention be under research and lack investment in their treatment though cancer survival rate rise by nearly between and rare cancer still have some of the low survival rate leave too many people without hope thank the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce this bill will argue in favour of it today use three example first the story of constituent suffering from rare cancer secondly the importance of this bill for extremely rare cancer and lastly its importance for future research there be many rare form of cancer that individual suffer often without specialised treatment or public awareness but every rare cancer patient have name and story take that of constituent recently meet in parliament at an event for world cancer day who suffer from cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia although the five year survival rate for leukaemia currently stand at the figure for acute myeloid leukaemia rare and aggressive form be one of the low of all cancer it have survival rate beyond five year after diagnosis this mean that sadly nearly of those diagnose with aml today will not survive until the end of this parliament surgery be not viable treatment option for those diagnose with leukaemia so such patient often depend on the discovery of new and innovative treatment to survive the disease though every cancer have name and story some be so rare that there be little representation of they even in debate like this that bring to my second example composite hemangioendothelioma or che it be first medically identify in only and by have few than case report in english language literature because of its rarity it be hard to treat and garner little attention from company that could develop treatment however those affect by che have name family and story hopefully my mention che in this debate may in small way help raise awareness of its existence this bill will assist we in this matter as it will result in the appointment of name person who be responsible for oversee the delivery of research into rare cancer treatment that will facilitate some political accountability for rare cancer research and encourage an ecosystem that can hopefully lead to future treatment for or at least more attention to even some of the rare cancer such as che talk of treatment early this week meet constituent who be researcher at the university of glasgow she be in parliament for the stem for britain exhibition we discuss her research on novel approach to treat osteosarcoma although it be the most common primary bone cancer only people be diagnose with osteosarcoma each year in the uk few than three people in every million of the population make it rare cancer under the bill current treatment lack specificity in target the tumour and often have unwanted side effect my constituent research look at the potential use of small molecule to create more effective and non invasive treatment for osteosarcoma the bill support for information sharing in the research registry system will help researcher like my constituent it will help with research and clinical trial by give researcher great access to the patient population with rare cancer like osteosarcoma patient survey in find that of those with rare or less common cancer be not offer clinical trial that be why the bill be important the bill will help to foster an environment in which there can be more research and clinical trial on rare cancer such as osteosarcoma for patient like my constituent suffering from cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia for those diagnose with the least understand cancer and for the researcher try to find new treatment the bill represent commitment to the fight against rare cancer therefore urge the house to support my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west and the bill today those of we who have lose friend or family member to cancer will no doubt have hear they describe often think somewhat unhelpfully as courageous but this morning we witness the most courageous exposition have ever hear in my life from my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn thank he for the privilege of allow we to listen to his love tribute to his brother we also hear from number of member include the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood and for witney charlie maynard and most forcefully my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh about the pressure of time and the urgent need to do something to find cure or treatment for rare cancer we have hear number of move speech this morning but will allow hon member to relax and recharge their emotional battery little bit because will address the issue of time and the practical consideration of how we can turn drug discovery into treatment as speedily as possible to do that will lift the lid on our drug supply chain and set out the vital role that the nhs can play in it there be lesson we can learn from the covid pandemic when it come to the drug supply chain we very quickly develop vaccine in the uk in oxford but we see quite quickly that the vaccine be worth nothing until it be in the arm of the population get that do require big effort include in industry as we hear from my hon friend the member for gravesham dr sullivan industry be also important the fujifilm factory in billingham in my constituency manufacture one of the covid vaccine and it will shortly turn billingham into the large biopharmaceutical manufacturing centre in the uk when it be make the vaccine it find that it have big problem this bring into play another town just up the river tees from billingham in the constituency of my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth member may have hear of it it become famous for particular reason during the pandemic but they may not be sight on the reason why will talk about it which have more to do with glass than glass barnard castle be home to glaxosmithkline which bottle the vaccine there be at the time global shortage of bottle for vaccine and in the uk we have only one glass manufacturer capable of do that job although soon there will be another in st helens hopefully after that little overview member can sense that there be big industrial supply chain issue that we need to address before we can get treatment to the people who need they most in fact there be number of researcher work on this area be sure that when we think of research into rare cancer we think of people in white coat and laboratory in place like oxford cambridge and imperial but urge we to also think about the process operator in billingham the bottle filler in barnard castle and the furnace operator in place like glass futures in st helens who be also work hard on research project to deliver those treatment the second issue that would like we to consider be the role that the nhs can and must play want to see transformatively different approach from the nhs in this area month ago in parliament meet representative of pancreatic cancer uk which know support the bill they talk to about pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy which be treatment for pancreatic cancer and about the difficulty in source sufficient quantity of treatment we all know from our constituency surgery that there be the same issue with common drug people suffer with other condition and people who have child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and so on be struggle to get the drug that they need part of the issue be that we rely so much on import we could be manufacture these product in the uk the nhs be the single big purchaser of drug in the world it have the market power to demand that production be centre in the uk that would bring clear economic benefit to the uk but it would also shorten cycle time for innovation because the researcher and the manufacturer would be close to one another and it would ensure security of supply in the uk it would mean that we could be proud of manufacture drug that help to treat people around the world it would also fit in with our industrial strategy my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care be talk only yesterday about the importance of life science to our industrial strategy and about their create british job in research and in factory very much thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce the bill he describe his father in law as dignified man my hon friend give an incredibly dignified speech and be sure that his father in law will be very proud we look forward to the day when people who suffer from rare cancer be not offer such treatment as breathe into brown paper bag as my hon friend describe or take paracetamol as my hon friend the member for south shields mrs lewell buck describe instead we should use the power of our nhs and the efficiency of our uk supply chain to turn discovery into drug and trial into lifesave treatment thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce the bill remember the day my dad be diagnose with terminal cancer remember my mum and dad pick up off the floor be suppose to be support they but that do not happen that day dr lau at blackpool victoria hospital explain that my dad cancer be terminal my dad be initially give chemotherapy to try to shrink the tumour and give we more time later he be ask to take part in trial use immunotherapy it be explain that the immune system do not recognise cancer as alien and as threat immunotherapy teach the immune system to recognise cancer and enable the body immune system to fight back my dad be fighter and he be willing to try anything his body struggle with chemotherapy and after we nearly lose he twice in month it be stop but the immunotherapy continue he finish the course without any complication once my dad start the treatment the cancer there be many never move to this day we do not know whether the treatment cure he and he be leave with just scar tissue or whether the cancer lie dormant what can tell the house be that my dad do not die of cancer it be something else that take he from we my family believe that we be give an extra three year of love and be love by my lovely dad because of immunotherapy we will always be grateful for the christmas day the birthday the celebration and sometimes the tear that we be all able to share with my wonderful care dad people with rare cancer deserve the funding and research trial that the bill will initiate they should have the chance of life that my dad be give that start with ensure that patient can get well access to clinical trial many people miss out on potentially life extend trial because there be just not as much information out there as there need to be recent research have find that of respondent with less common or rare cancer be not offer an opportunity to be part of clinical trial that have to change and the bill would achieve that support the bill because everyone diagnose with cancer should be give every chance of survival without the bill people with rare cancer will die soon than other cancer patient not have be give the chance to fight this terrible disease speak for they so that they can have the chance that be award to my dad thank dr lau my dad consultant for give an year old man the precious gift of life for few year long thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce the bill it may be the most repeat phrase in the chamber but politics be about choice and he have rank so highly in the private member bill ballot an early accolade in this parliament choose bill that would put patient suffer from rare cancer and their family high up on the list of priority as my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn so movingly put it hope that in time the bill will mean that in some instance my constituent in falkirk and family across the united kingdom will get precious extra hour day week and year to spend with our love one every member of the house and every constituent have speak to about this have story of love one who have suffer through the heartbreaking cruelty of cancer diagnosis lose two of my grandparent in their early still remember the seven year of my life that spend with my grandad robin we find plenty of time to exchange robust view on football and be sure that if he have more time with we we would today be exchange view on life and politic too he be lucky though to meet all four of his grandchild thank to the immense care he receive from his doctor and the support he get from his family remember my granny janet who pass away in after month battle with brain tumour remember most fondly she fuss over everyone in the house to make sure they have absolutely everything they need at all time remember hold her hand in strathcarron hospice where she have volunteer for number of year and where she receive care in her final day one thing have draw from those experience be the value of our nhs and hospice staff to those who have cancer and their family those staff day in day out take the bad part of life and allow we to endure they we should arm they with the good possible tool for treat illness and disease statistically half of we in the chamber will have to comprehend our own diagnosis of some type of cancer the definition of rare cancer be for the purpose of the bill one that affect few than one in people we must acknowledge that active intervention be require to ensure that research treatment and clinical pathway for those cancer have parity with other cancer research as have be mention rare cancer account for about of all cancer diagnosis will go through the bill and each of its clause to show why support it clause and the statutory requirement for review relate to orphan medicine will be an essential step to gain comprehensive understanding of the availability of medicine and how they can well be calibrate towards new treatment and new research the comparative approach that the bill put forward for the review acknowledge that while we have proud history of world class research other country have be able to make substantial stride in this area in recent year when we have not in the last six year the uk have drop from be rank second for the availability of orphan medicine behind only germany to england be and scotland be among european country that do not necessarily look like regression but it potentially expose stagnation in advance research that would benefit those suffering from rare cancer the british pharmaceutical industry have state that it be increasingly challenging to develop medicine for rare disease in this country cite among other thing the low prospect of nhs reimbursement for rare disease medicine clause give the secretary of state duty to promote research on rare cancer ensure that patient can be easily contact about such research and ensure appropriate oversight of rare cancer that be progressive move as the duty to promote research will write into law that any health secretary must take proactive approach to maintain and promote rare cancer research it embed in the government job description duty to ensure that ease of contact be properly facilitate and that there be appropriate oversight the bill be not overreach when it say that strategic co ordination be key the appointment of national speciality lead for rare cancer will put into law the requirement for champion who can cut through any silos that exist or that start to develop as the bill take effect clause be critical part of the framework it will aid the building of robust evidential basis for clinical trial by make bespoke register for those with rare cancer the sharing of information from the national disease registration service by the nhs with the nihr be part of research registry so that patient can be identify and contact will improve an issue that have come up several time when have speak to organisation in this space there be not enough people available for clinical trial for rare cancer correspondingly as have be mention by other member clearly there be substantial barrier at the patient end find that of those with rare cancer have not be offer clinical trial that evidence the clear case for the change propose in the bill with rapid advance in cancer treatment there be massive opportunity to take step forward in increase survivability after diagnosis for all these new treatment to be effective there need to be correspond clinical trial currently connect those with rare cancer to clinical researcher involve an amount of luck that the information about the trial will make its way to the patient or that they will be aware of clinical trial organise the register so that clinical trial can get in touch with patient will simplify and improve the efficiency and efficacy of the system save time and increase the chance of successful trial give the bill my full support start by thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for raise this deeply important issue know that speak for everyone here in find his word about his father in law and the story of kira very moving join he in welcome kira family pay tribute to my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for her campaign on this issue her sister would be very proud of she also pay tribute to everyone who have speak for both their bravery and the immense bravery of their constituent and their family member particularly want to recognise the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood and the story of dan the hon member for esher and walton monica harding my hon friend the member for blackpool north and fleetwood lorraine beavers for her powerful speech about her father and my hon friend the member for falkirk euan stainbank for his speech about his grandparent give special mention to my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn be so sorry that do not get chance to meet his brother alex he sound like phenomenal human being be so sorry for my hon friend loss but know that his brother would be very proud of he my heart go out to those who have share their story thank they for their bravery as so many story show the term rare cancer be misleading the cancer we class as rare in total account for almost half of all cancer diagnosis each year and as have be mention tragically they account for over all cancer death give that on average one in two of we develop some form of cancer in our lifetime the chance of experience one of these so call rare or less common cancer or see they diagnose in love one be far high than the term suggest in the come year people will be diagnose with these type of cancer equivalent to the population of city the size of swindon sadly people will lose their life as result the population of city the size of chester behind each one of those tragic statistic lie story of family bereave of mother father sister brother and child lose and of life tear apart that be bring home to when visit chai cancer care in my constituency to hear the story of many people battle to live with cancer their bravery be inspiring and they need our help now commend the government work to improve cancer outcome for all last month they launch the call for evidence to inform the development of national cancer plan and hope that we can pass the bill to support those effort illness classify as rare or less common be among some of the very cruell the bill seek to address some of the fundamental reason why diagnosis of comparatively rare form of cancer can leave patient with disproportionately low chance of make full recovery for start rare cancer be hard to diagnose there be many reason for that some of the more common cancer have screen programme which mean that many people be diagnose before they have symptom sadly that be much less common in the case of rare cancer additionally doctor see the symptom of common cancer more frequently and so be more likely to spot they also currently of patient with rare or less common form of cancer be not offer clinical trial the bill will seek to reduce the knowledge gap on rare cancer propose national specialty lead for rare cancer to advise on research design and facilitate collaboration in rare cancer research and specific rare cancer registry to share information to improve the recruitment of participant for rare cancer clinical trial however although we need to incentivise research it be not the only barrier that we face to improve rare cancer outcome the comparatively low occurrence of many rare cancer mean that although drug to combat they often exist for economic reason they be not develop by the pharma industry despite the pressing and urgent need for they these orphan drug have the potential not only to save thousand of life but to provide hundred and thousand of family with that most valuable thing to which my hon friend the member for calder valley refer more time with their love one under normal market condition pharma company may be unwilling to invest in the research and development of new treatment for disease that affect few people than the most common form of cancer the figure be stark five of the six less survivable cancer receive only of the research funding for more survivable cancer by propose that the secretary of state will be require to review the current law on marketing authorisation for these orphan drug and by place duty on government to support research and innovation far the bill would go long way to achieve something that many of we would view as common sense incentivise the production of these medical product and put they to use where they be so badly need in the diagnosis prevention and treatment of cancer also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west and his team for the work they have do to improve the power of collaboration among member of parliament the charity sector and patient advocate draw on medical expertise and live experience their diligence in bring about the bill be bear out by the widespread support it have gather across the house accord to pancreatic cancer uk the bill have the potential to transform survival for rare cancer by encourage great focus and drive to research and the brain tumour charity have also praise it know from my own experience talk to constituent in hendon and visit hospital such as the royal free just how crucial one word can be hope cancer be one of the defining health issue of our time cause the death of people in this country every single day we know there be no silver bullet we must fight cancer on all front from research to prevention to diagnosis to treatment and know the government be wholly commit to do that thank to huge oncological step forward in recent year outlook for cancer patient have improve dramatically we have reach the milestone of more than of people diagnose with cancer in england and wales now survive their disease for year or more yet this number fall sharply for many of the rare cancer we have talk about today we must recognise as this bill do where the shortfall be in our share knowledge and the resource we put into the rarer form of this disease we have duty to put this right we must ensure that those suffer from rare and less common form of cancer and those yet to be diagnose have as much cause for hope as possible support this bill start by thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for bring forward this important bill thank the many other member from across the house who have contribute so movingly today and my constituent who reach out to to share their view will try to keep my contribution brief because know other will want to speak in particular would like to thank maria and her daughter lauren who tell about maria journey and her fight against leiomyosarcoma be the second person today to struggle to pronounce that word and how that diagnosis during the covid lockdown turn her life upside down navigate the pandemic be hard enough navigate it while one of the people you love most in the world be suffer with cancer must have be nearly impossible maria be still live with leiomyosarcoma and have chemotherapy once month as she and her daughter tell live with cancer be tough enough when it be rare cancer patient live with the fear that the disease will act quick than the research make progress that be why this bill be so important we need to close the gap in the treatment so that more people diagnose with rare cancer have the same chance of survival as those with other cancer another constituent of mine know the cost of that all too well he have ask not to share his or his wife name but instead to tell her story she pass away last year after be diagnose with leiomyosarcoma despite the good effort of the oncology unit the rarity of the cancer mean that it take too long to identify her condition year of chemotherapy follow sadly to no avail although have two example of leiomyosarcoma in my constituency it be incredibly rare one challenge of that cancer be its genetic variability and the fact that it have many different subtype personalised medicine be particularly important for rare cancer with different subtype but because of the small number of patient with leiomyosarcoma it be extremely difficult if not impossible to run robust clinical trial research be possible however and great stride be be make in the us show that well treatment and outcome be possible it be vital that we incentivise research of and investment into the treatment of rare cancer and begin to close that gap thank my hon friend again for introduce this important debate and the bill thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce the bill he have channel his personal experience and that of his family to produce vital piece of legislation hope that he succeed in drive change on this issue he certainly have my support and that of all member of the house it be on day like this that call member of parliament from across the house my hon friend rather than hon member this cause certainly unite we know from read email from my telford constituent that they be fully behind the bill join my hon friend in pay tribute to the many people who have tell the story of love one in their family and community they be far braver than next thursday will be bearer at the funeral of woman who be very special in my life be not quite brave enough to tell her story today but maybe one day will have hear about devastating impact from number of constituent who have contact to share their story hear from one constituent about the mother of his three teenage child she be in her and battle terminal pancreatic cancer after late diagnosis among those story familiar theme arise condition such as pancreatic cancer be be diagnose too late and there be no available treatment my constituent love one be give just month to live focus on pancreatic cancer because it be an example of the scandal of rare cancer treatment it be class as rare cancer by the bill because it affect few than one person in every every year one in every people be diagnose with pancreatic cancer and half of they die within three month there be roughly people in telford which mean that of my constituent will be diagnose with that awful cancer each and every year and nine of they will die within three month of diagnosis that be absolutely shocking owe it to those people in my constituency to speak up in the chamber and demand drastic change it be easy to see how this problem can arise although that do not make it any less galling in healthcare system under strain that be fail cancer patient in particular last year uk cancer survival rate be year behind some other european country decision maker might be face with sophie choice the unenviable task of prioritise cancer treatment when resource be scarce the treatment that will save the most people be prioritise but that be no consolation to the of patient in the uk whose cancer be rare and less common an even more damning statistic be that sufferer of rare and less common cancer make up the majority of cancer death as we have clearly that be not sustainable fair or just we can not let single cancer patient slip through the crack in our healthcare service let alone people each and every year all too often people in my constituency and across the country will as we have hear rally around to raise money for their love one their child to receive treatment on one level that be amazing to see but on another it be depress that that have to be do in order for people to access lifesave treatment the bill be about acknowledge that we can do well the treatment of rare cancer patient be scandal not in the sense that any one individual be liable or culpable but because the system as whole have let ten of thousand of cancer patient down to the healthcare and research sector we say you must do well we want you to do well and we will work alongside you to do well the bill be welcome first step in do that urge the government to be bold this cohort of member of parliament and ministers can do lot on this agenda we talk lot in this place about hope and change well goodness what well example be there than this bill of provide hope and change to million of people across our country let make cancer history there be hardly family in the uk who have not be touch by cancer in some way this morning debate have show how much we reflect the population and the feeling of fear anxiety and heartbreak that come with it but for those diagnose with rare cancer the challenge be even great delay diagnosis few treatment option and the shocking lack of research which mean that these patient and their family be often leave in the dark be glad that we be unite in say that that have to change be so proud to support the bill introduce by my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur think possibly work with his father in law at bell baxter many year ago because we now have the chance to turn the tide and focus on people with rare cancer we have talk lot about the statistic rare cancer still do not get the same investment in research or access to clinical trial as common cancer as result survival rate for some of the least survivable cancer like pancreatic cancer brain cancer and stomach cancer be stick at just which be not good enough seven week ago lose my dad more time have now pass since his death than the time we have between his diagnosis and his passing the grief be still exceptionally raw pay tribute to my hon friend dad he would be extremely proud of she and of the speech that she be make thank my hon friend for that intervention the brain tumour charity and brain tumour research have highlight time and again that just of national cancer research funding go towards brain tumour despite their be the big cancer killer of child and adult under that be totally unacceptable people who be deal with these devastating diagnosis need more than word they need real investment in clinical trial and well pathway to diagnosis the bill be about fairness it be about tackle the lack of funding the difficulty in get patient into research and the absence of clear government leadership in this area people miss out on life change trial because they simply do not know that they exist my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh talk about have universal system in this country we also have one of the most siloe system people in one part of the system often do not know what be go on in other part and we need that to stop we have talk lot about the approach in place like the united states where targeted policy have lead to surge in new treatment for rare cancer but we also need to recognise what else be go on in the united states raft of executive order from the white house be put high education and current clinical trial into tailspin want to pay tribute to the people who have help lot over the last few week in particular my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden she talk about be angry just remember that anger be natural stage of grief but it be also massive driver for change and for get thing do be not at the angry stage just yet but will be at some point and when get there will certainly be join my hon friend it be something we all get somebody say to many year ago that the great gift that any of we can give be the gift of time no matter our political difference on other thing we have chance today to give other the gift of time and to make sure no other family have to experience what we have have to go through please pass this bill thank you thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for bring forward this important bill and for his tireless work in champion the need for great focus on research into rare cancer have work as district nurse for over year have see time and again the devastation cancer bring not just to those diagnose but to their family friend and community the harsh reality be that one in two of we will face cancer at some point in our life it be an issue that touch all of we in some way while we have make significant stride in cancer treatment and survival rate progress have not be equal some cancer like the rarer less survivable cancer have be unjustly leave behind cancer such as pancreatic oesophageal liver brain and stomach still face staggeringly low survival rate currently the least survivable cancer have five year survival rate of just compare with for all other cancer this disparity be not just statistic it be failure in our service and the way these cancer be research which have cost life shattered family and leave too many of we without hope key driver of this have be the chronic underfunding and lack of focus on research into these cancer which have mean that we lack test and the tool and treatment need to give people fighting chance the consequence of this neglect be devastating this issue be deeply personal to have lose love one to pancreatic cancer disease that steal live with ruthless efficiency lose my good friend woman full of life and love to this cruel illness she endure month of uncertainty before finally receive diagnosis in august only to pass away shortly after her story be of delay diagnosis miss opportunity and system that fail she sadly her story be not unique find it truly shock that in more than half of those diagnose with pancreatic cancer will die within three month and only will survive pancreatic cancer be the fifth big cancer killer in the uk but receive only of the uk cancer research budget this lack of investment have mean we be not see the treatment breakthrough that have transform outcome for other type of cancer it do not have to be this way we know that sustained research funding and strategic focus from the government can dramatically improve survival rate we have see it work for other cancer particularly welcome the bill proposal to nominate name lead to focus on these rare cancer ensure that they be no long overlook as well as its provision to give people well opportunity to take part in innovative cut edge trial that be why support the bill the rare cancers bill offer road map to bring real life lifesave change to those diagnose with life threaten disease it be not just about policy but about people it be about give hope to those who have be leave behind as chair of the all party parliamentary group on the less survivable cancer and vice chair of the health and social care committee firmly believe that through the provision of this bill we can start say start to bring forward access to innovative treatment that could turn the tide say to member of this house let we be bold let we make difference let we ensure that future generation have well chance of survival than those who come before they let we send clear message to patient and their family that they be not forget this be our moment to make lasting impact let we make it count let we support this bill pay tribute to my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce the bill and for his work in bring about this necessary debate on rare cancer also pay tribute to all member who have speak today but particularly to my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn for his heartbreaking tribute to his brother like too many across this house and throughout the united kingdom have be on the receive end of the devastating news that love one have be diagnose with cancer but when that cancer be define as rare it be infinitely more terrifying when confront with the reality that there be lack of funding and research dedicate to those cancer therefore welcome the three step in the bill to encourage further research into rare cancer welcome the fact that it will place duty on the secretary of state for health and social care to facilitate or otherwise promote research into rare cancer the bill will ensure that appropriate arrangement be in place for patient to be easily contact about research opportunity and clinical trial and will also ensure that there be adequate oversight of research delivery for rare cancer also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh for her dedication in bring glioblastoma and other type of brain cancer to the forefront of the political debate would like to mention the all party parliamentary group on brain tumour and its work to raise awareness of the issue face the brain tumour community have see at first hand how devastating glioblastoma can be my dear friend and constituent ann and richard lucas lose their son fionn in fionn be diagnose with glioblastoma age in june and his cancer leave he with very short time to live he die two month later the lucas family have support the work of the brain tumour charity to help find new treatment offer the high level of support and drive urgent change give the charity aim of save and improve life and carry out research into brain tumour globally glioblastomas be fast grow brain tumour they be the most common type of cancerous malignant brain tumour in adult yet as have be say there be still lack of funding of the of research that be specifically about rare cancer only be focus on brain and nervous system cancer therefore welcome this bill thank my hon friend the members for edinburgh south west and for mitcham and morden and place on record my support for the aim of the bill to support research and to support those impact by rare cancer will try to keep my remark brief as be keen that other colleague get to speak in this important debate as we have hear rare cancer be define as those that affect few than one in individual in hyndburn that equate to an estimate people be impact behind every number be story as we have hear of patient and those who love they of life cut short that could have be save or prolong have the right diagnosis and treatment be available want to spend few minute speak about constituent in hyndburn who have reach out to and about some of my personal experience be grateful to carol who reach out on behalf of herself and her daughter emma who be battle rare cancer and be the mum of two girl every day and every advancement could be transformational for that family thank janet who lose her granddaughter elizabeth for also reach out elizabeth be real fighter she raise over before she die and she leave her body to research demonstrate what individual be do in this fight it be now the government turn to step in and meet what have already be put in by family and community want to thank sheila who sadly lose her sister margaret and her father in law to pancreatic cancer also want to mention milly the incredible young girl who die of leukaemia when she be just year old not month after be diagnose her mother lorraine always remind to talk about milly life and what she bring while she be with we she should have turn last year but she be the girl with the bright smile who take on life and everything it throw at she and who be brave to the last we owe it to the memory of milly and her mum incredible work with their charity milly smiles to do all we can to tackle this in future and to take action today when be in my late one of my good friend lose both her mother and her sister within year one to melanoma and the other to ovarian cancer the reality be that if they have be live in america for at least one of they if not both we would have have more time that be not good enough refuse to accept that and today we can take step to ensure that people like my friend do not have to be leave literally with none of their family and can have that precious time however long that might be because every day week and birthday really count the rare cancers bill represent comprehensive approach to address the disparity face by individual with rare cancer by revise the regulatory framework promote dedicated research and facilitate patient participation in clinical trial this legislation have the potential to transform the landscape of rare cancer treatment in the uk be glad that this labour government be support the bill as part of the development of the desperately need national cancer plan recognise that the provision of the bill be crucial step towards equity and excellence in cancer care for all patient regardless of the rarity of their diagnosis commend my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur on bring forward his important bill also commend hon member across this house for their powerful and move speech particularly those of my hon friend the members for calder valley josh fenton glynn for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh and for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray who show that the love for sibling or child persist forever and can be harness to bring about change be speak today because my constituent mr peter realf contact about his son stephen who be train to be an raf pilot when he be diagnose with astrocytoma he be just tragically despite his cancer be describe as low grade and despite receive treatment that prolong his life he die six year later age just can not imagine the pain and sense of loss feel by stephen family and friend and my heart go out to they and all those who have face the consequence of this cruel disease mr realf and his family have campaign tirelessly since stephen death to address the baffling paradox that despite brain tumour kill more child and adult under than any other cancer and despite they rob patient of more year of their life than any other cancer only fraction of the government research funding into cancer be use for brain tumour at just of national spend accord to the charity brain tumour research stephen realf case be stark talented hard work and clearly impressive young man who die young lose perhaps year of life and year of potential huge public petition and an article write by stephen sister maria lead in to the then new petitions committee of this house conduct its first inquiry challenge any right hon and hon member to read the report conclusion from nine year ago and not to conclude that in general little have improve since then we should be deeply concerned though perhaps as my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden have indicate the appropriate emotion be strong one we hear of the additional million pledge by the last government and how accord to report million of it be yet to be release to scientist after one of the relevant authority the national institute for health and care research come to see we at the all party parliamentary group on brain tumour recently my colleague and the campaigner patient and family present still could not fathom just why the money have not be spend in all those year be relatively new to this place but have be observe politic for long time and something about this issue do not fit it do not feel right something be profoundly wrong where there should be outrage there appear to be relative indifference not to death and suffering of course but to the need for radical change to get money flow where there should be urgency among the authority for after all people be die often young there appear to be degree of inertia and where there should be action we often get lose in the chilling snowstorm of bureaucracy be not impugn the decency compassion or professionalism of official researcher or clinician they be of course commit to help to cure treat and prevent cancer however as with other example of institutional failure it do not take overt malice just the absence of grip and tenacity in the face of injustice or of challenge the status quo for good thing not to happen or even for bad and preventable outcome to occur do not know why progress do not seem to be happen what reason could there possibly be for the continue paradox of the underfunding of rare cancer research we must find out the reason and overcome those force or perhaps even vested interest because the stake could not be high little have change in term of treatment and survivability since the patient with brain tumour do not have time on their side as many hon member have say sadly most of those diagnose die within five year the following statistic from brain tumour research be stark but before read they should say that be glad of the progress on more common cancer which have affect my family as they have every family brain tumour research state brain tumour kill more child than leukaemia brain tumour kill more man under than prostate cancer and more woman under than breast cancer incidence of and death from brain tumour be increase at the current rate of spending it could take year for brain cancer to catch up with development in other disease and find cure that be why the bill introduce by my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west be so needed it offer practical step to get more funding into research to take on and defeat those cancer finally know my ministerial colleague want only the good for patient so gently encourage they if they have not already do so to ask this question of official why be it that research into these cancer which cause so much death and suffering among the young and rob so many people of so many year of life be receive so little funding minister should keep ask until they get satisfactory answer mp should keep ask until we get satisfactory answer we should work together cross party if possible to overcome obstacle and we should certainly pass this bill the pain loss concern and even anger must be channel into urgent substantive action we owe it to the past current and future victim of rare cancer and to their family thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for bring forward this bill if as we always say politic be the language of priority then my hon friend have get his absolutely correct thank all member who have share their experience and their story some incredibly move they should be what inspire we to take forward all the action we be propose today be strike by the fact that the hon member for wokingham clive jones and have something in common which we probably would not want to have in common in that we be both diagnose with breast cancer in have to say my breast cancer be strange breast cancer and it always feel slightly strange talk about it because no one ever hear of it it be not rare cancer as such because it be breast cancer although there be some who argue it be actually soft tissue sarcoma whatever it be treat as breast cancer it be call phyllode tumour unlike other breast tumour phyllode tumour do not go into the duct but into the connective tissue it present differently from other cancer of the breast and the treatment be also different in that the only treatment that work be excision excision can be anything from lumpectomy to mastectomy the hope be that there be clear margin which mean the patient will be okay but and it be big malignant phyllode tumour be present it can spread and it can be difficult or impossible to treat that be when it become very different outcome mention it today not because it be rare cancer but because it can be difficult to diagnose it do not show up in mammogram for example and there be no definitive explanation why such tumour occur some research be go on just now but it be not conclusive as yet lot more work need to happen and because incidence be so low it be difficult to research the thing we know about it for certain seem random to they tend to occur more often in the left breast why have no idea they usually occur when patient be in their as have say they do not seem to respond to chemo or radiotherapy and they be not think to be genetic or hormonal the reason mention my case be that it can be lonely thing to have an unusual cancer when try to explain it to family and friend you say no it do not show up in mammogram no be not get chemotherapy or radiotherapy no do not know why it happen no have not hear of it either you begin to doubt yourself little and you begin to question what be actually go on for someone with very rare cancer it must be incredibly difficult when there be not background of research not anything that they can read and no one can give they pamphlet about it and tell they what be happen it seem to that we should know more about cancer full stop we have get to and we know some thing about cancer we know how to treat some cancer but there be so many other that we do not have the answer for we need people to be diagnose more quickly which mean that we have to have the research we need people to have the good possible treatment which mean we have to look at the drug and find out what work and what do not work and where drug can be transfer from one thing to another successfully crucially we have to know why it be that some people get cancer and other do not this bill will make huge difference to the life of some of the people we have hear about today for some as we know it will not be soon enough it be the responsibility of every single one of we to make change happen and we have an opportunity today to take that step forward my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh speak about her sister margaret who work with for time in the labour party while be listen to the other speech be reflect on what my hon friend say think we all need to be angry we need to say to shout it from the rooftop that change begin today that be very powerful call leigh ingham be proud to share the benches with all the hon member here the advocacy that we have hear have be incredibly move my constituent rosalind rob mark and michelle ask to speak today they support the bill as do patients with rare cancer face incredible challenge include delay diagnosis limited treatment option and lack of research investment that often leave they feel forget this bill will change that narrative it be call to action for great investment well access to clinical trial and strong commitment to research that will ultimately save life barrier and bureaucracy must not stand in the way of innovation that be why support the measure in the bill that call for comprehensive review of how we approve treatment for rare cancer my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh say that more powerfully than ever will the bill be about fairness dignity and hope it have significant support from hon member across the house not just as politician but as people who understand the value of every life hope that we all get to vote for it today thank all hon member for their moving passionate and powerful speech congratulate my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur on bring forward the bill and on the work he have do with so many stakeholder commend he on share the story of his father in law who will be sadly miss by he and his family the story of my hon friend father in law have prompt significant number of my constituent in edinburgh north and leith who be advocate for the bill to share their story constituent tell about their friend who pass away aged in november they be diagnose with two rare cancer on each occasion they be inform by their doctor that it be cancer that they do not know how to treat my constituent friend tragically die unable to understand why more be not know about those rare cancer despite the large amount of money that have be put into research and the win achieve in cancer care and treatment by scientist and medic over the past few decade in edinburgh many cancer patient be treat at the edinburgh cancer research centre at the western general hospital which border my edinburgh north and leith constituency establish in the cancer research uk scotland centre bring together the very good in cancer research from edinburgh and glasgow work with over team the centre have establish process and have access to two of the large cancer treatment centre in scotland make trial and research more efficient one of the centre six research theme be mesothelioma rare cancer that affect the lining of the lung abdoman or heart be keen to hear from my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west about his engagement with the university of edinburgh and the edinburgh cancer research centre on the bill the bill cross devolve and reserved area believe in pool and share resource just as profit should not be barrier to research neither should the border at gretna be keen to hear from my hon friend or the minister about any discussion that have take place with the scottish government and other devolve administration to ensure that we work across the uk and use the research talent of the university of edinburgh and other across the uk we need join up approach to make breakthrough on the treatment and care of those with rare cancer have there be dialogue with ministers in scotland and other devolve ministers on clause and have devolve ministers give any undertaking to replicate the proposal in conclusion the bill will make difference to our constituent and be delighted to speak in support of it my mum violet die two decade ago within six week of her cancer be diagnose hope that the bill will give hope and time to every family impact by cancer diagnosis thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for introduce the bill many of my constituent have share with their experience of rare cancer and the experience of their family and friend rare cancer make up almost half of cancer diagnosis so the bill be very much welcome constituent write to recently about their seven year old son who be diagnose with medulloblastoma rare form of brain cancer sadly their son do not survive despite that cancer have survival rate medulloblastoma be on spectrum of high to low risk which far complicate ability to predict the outcome of treatment be here to represent that child their family and other family affect by rare cancer welcome the increase in research funding and support for early detection and diagnosis welcome the introduction of the bill and wholeheartedly support it will be brief because understand that we be at the end of the debate but rise to support the bill and pay tribute to my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for bring it forward and for the dignified collegiate manner in which he have go about thing up to people in paisley and renfrewshire south will be face less survivable cancer that is people who will wait long for diagnosis will face postcode lottery to access specialist treatment and will be leave ask why there be so few treatment option available the truth be that rare cancer do not receive the research attention or funding that they need the bill would take decisive action to change that it would introduce measure to break down systemic barrier prevent research and innovation in rare cancer these be not abstract policy change but lifesave reform that would give patient with rare cancer great access to clinical trial researcher would have well tool to study the disease and pharmaceutical company would be give strong incentive to invest in treatment that could transform life behind every rare cancer diagnosis be person fight for their future family search for answer and healthcare professional look for well treatment option we can not allow those individual to be leave behind simply because their condition be consider rare we have the opportunity to change that by support the bill we send clear message that no cancer be too rare to matter and that no patient should be forget be proud to support the bill and thank my hon friend for bring it forward call the shadow secretary of state may start by extend to the hon member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray and her family my sincere condolence on the passing of her father this be an important bill often say to constituent if you wish to see the house of commons at its good tune in and watch on friday say that again today have hear the debate it be it be rare for shadow secretary of state to take to the front bench on friday to respond on private member bill but the debate have reinforce my determination to be here as the hon member for bootle peter dowd say like to call he my hon friend this be bill of hope pay tribute to the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur for his clear and compelling articulation of the case for the bill and for be willing to share something as personal as the loss of his father in law and his family circumstance he speak about that with great dignity with debate of such quality it be always invidious to pick out contribution but can not resist do so have to pick up the contribution of the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh when be minister we often work with each other and speak on matter relate to health although not this subject her passion determination and energy for change and for something well come across in everything she do and that build on the fact that this be bill for hope pay tribute to she for her work and her dedication have be member of this house for year and before the election be minister for six two and half of those year be spend as minister in the department of health and social care during the pandemic in time that be challenge for everyone but have to say that have rarely hear speech as powerful and move or that hold the house so completely as that of the hon member for calder valley josh fenton glynn although do not know his brother suspect that he would have be deeply proud of the hon member today rare in this context be often misnomer because although individually these cancer be rare collectively they be sadly all too prevalent as we have hear from hon member approximately of all cancer death be down to so call rare cancer the breadth of those rare cancer be huge they include blood cancer cancer of the female reproductive organ head and neck cancer pancreatic cancer brain cancer the hon member for mitcham and morden speak about glioblastomas and importantly child and young people cancer which the hon member for esher and walton monica harding speak about we have all see the amazing work by powerful campaigner on these issue and by the huge array of charity campaign in this space the brain tumour charity the tessa jowell brain cancer mission leukaemia uk pancreatic cancer uk and whole range of other dedicated and amazing institution they do fantastic job like other hon member recently meet pancreatic cancer uk to hear about its work the hon member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton may well have do the same initially it be to discuss pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy drug shortage and the urgent need for some sort of solution but we also have the opportunity to talk more broadly about pancreatic cancer and rare cancer pancreatic cancer uk highlight issue that be specific to pancreatic cancer but that suspect be reflective of many rare cancer the challenge of diagnosis the challenge pose by late diagnosis the reliance on single therapeutic or small number of therapeutic with complex supply chain and the challenge of clinical trial sadly so few people with pancreatic cancer even when they be able to enlist on such trial survive long enough to provide the datum that will make real difference the bill will help to address that because each rare cancer be different each rare cancer need focus research and treatment the hon member for bootle set out clearly the orphan drug regime for rare cancer yes there be incentive under the regulation it be possible to incentivise pharmaceutical company that may not be incline to invest in research in area that may benefit only few in comparison with the large number affect by other cancer the regime seek to give market exclusivity right for year help to reduce the cost of market authorisation but we have to ask the question that the bill ask be it actually do the job it need to do to genuinely incentivise company to invest in research in this space the hon member for mitcham and morden mention the nhs repurposing project if we make it work effectively it will be very practical way in which while we wait for specialist research to come through we can still do something believe that the bill go long way towards address the issue the review of the orphan drug regime particularly the international angle be hugely important welcome all the provision in the bill especially those on the specialist registry and on the sharing of information to get more people into trial as with any bill there be some thing that believe would benefit from further explanation but that be what committee be for as shadow secretary of state be happy to confirm that the hon member for edinburgh south west have our support for the passage of his bill through second reading and into committee in this place and in life there be time to act believe that this be it we have huge potential and huge talent in this country let we help focus that on save more life and give more precious time to more people be pleased and proud to offer my support to the hon gentleman for the passage of his bill first let say how sorry be to hear that my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur recently lose his father in law to glioblastoma congratulate he on introduce this legislation less than year after his election his wife and child will be immensely proud to see he in the chamber today he have the full support of many charity such as pancreatic cancer uk the brain tumour charity and cancer research uk as well as people up and down the country who have write to their mp urge they to join this debate and vote for the bill also pay tribute to all those right hon and hon member who have lose love one and remember they so powerfully today thank they for the courage that they have show in share their story particularly do not think that anyone in this chamber or watch from the gallery or beyond could have fail to be move by the powerful story from my hon friend the members for calder valley josh fenton glynn for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray and for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh to whom give particular thank for her tireless campaign on glioblastoma follow the untimely loss of her sister margaret also pay tribute to those who remember their constituent be delighted that very soon will be meet my hon friend the member for hyndburn sarah smith and lorraine to discuss milly smiles let take the opportunity to add my memory of joe chilcott the son of my friend tim and verity and sister to ellie who be diagnose with brain tumour at the age of it be heartbreaking to lose he when he be just thank all the hon member who have speak today will seek to address as many of the issue raise as possible there be so many story recognise the people who be remember in those story those in the gallery and the many more watch at home they be willing the bill to succeed on behalf of the government it be my great pleasure to pledge our support for the bill we be undertake fundamental reform of the nhs people live with rare cancer must be at the heart of that change rare cancer patient deserve well and the bill give they something that have be speak about across the house today new hope let begin my remark on what the bill will do why we support it and our policy on rare cancer more generally clinical research be one of the most important way in which we can improve healthcare by identify the good way to prevent diagnose and treat cancer the bill will encourage the placement of clinical trial for rare cancer in england by ensure that the patient population can easily be contact by researcher streamline the recruitment process it will also ensure government review of regulation relevant to orphan drug designation to ensure that they continue to deliver for patient innovation in the bill will complement the radical action that we be develop through the year health plan and the national cancer plan to fix the nhs on which will expand later research be key part of this effort which be why the department of health and social care through the national institute for health and care research invest more than billion year in health research in the nihr invest million in cancer research as we have hear rare brain cancer such as glioblastoma have devastating impact on people and their loved one that be why the nihr announce in september new package of funding opportunity for brain cancer research and establish in december new national brain tumour research consortium bring together researcher from wide range of different discipline that be in parallel with dedicated funding call for research into wraparound care and the rehabilitation and quality of life of patient with brain tumour we remain committed to accelerate new breakthrough in high quality research to drive improvement in the diagnosis management and treatment of brain and other rare cancer for well survival rate and patient outcome the hon member for esher and walton monica harding my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden and other ask how the million promise for brain tumour have be spend in the five year since the nihr have invest million directly in brain cancer with furth million to enable brain tumour research in study involve people the commitment remain in place can confirm that there be no upper limit on that funding we be explore additional research policy option to encourage more clinical trial in early phase research and the development of medical device and diagnostic we have also talk lot about other rare cancer include lobular breast cancer for which we be support research through the research infrastructure include biomedical research centre we welcome further funding application for research on all condition include lobular breast cancer we continue to consider whether abbreviate form of breast magnetic resonance imagining fast mri can detect breast cancer that be miss by screen through mammography such as lobular and the other type of breast cancer that have be mention we be also support the opening of study on blood cancer provide an online registry call be part of research which allow user to search for and participate in study relevant to they clinical trial be crucial part of cancer research they provide patient with early access to groundbreake and possibly lifesave treatment the measure in the bill align strongly with our commitment to that and aim to streamline clinical trial recruitment process my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden speak passionately about how long it take trust to negotiate contract we recognise that issue and be begin to make progress nhs commercial contracting have be standardise and the national contract value review have reduce study set up time by from day to day in the first month analysis we continue in that work the hon member for wokingham clive jones and my hon friend the member for bootle peter dowd ask how we be work across border we be take forward the most significant reform of uk clinical trial regulation in over year while maintain robust protection and safeguarding for clinical trial participant the mhra already authorise cross border clinical trial include those conduct in the eu and on uk base trial site the be part of research programme use information from national and international source my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden speak so passionately we have all comment on her passion and anger appreciate her frustration and share her desire for radical action think we can all agree that the government announcement yesterday on scrap nhs england demonstrate our willingness to be bold take risk and do thing differently member raise several other matter will come back to they all with more detailed information on those issue but do not have the time to do so today will address the national cancer plan however which be raise number of time it be really important to fulfil our goal of transform cancer care and we will not just cherry pick the most common cancer we need rise tide that will lift all ship as person who be live with an incurable cancer myself can not overstate how deeply feel the honour and responsibility of be ask to drive forward our work in create the national cancer plan it be my absolute honour but while we take stride to fix cancer service be under no illusion that the government or hold all the answer so my plea be for hon member to work with we and share their expertise ask they please to visit shape the national cancer plan on the department website and to contribute evidence the government be commit to make real difference for patient with rare cancer for those affect by this devastating disease every discovery every treatment

and so much more and thank the staff in my office think noel and solomon be here today but it be team effort back in edinburgh be lucie salim xavier evie and hannah hon member hear hear they deserve that in all the contribution today we have hear evidence that people with rare cancer diagnosis face great injustice because their chance be so much slim and they face so much uncertainty we have show that we want change we be not just be angry we be use that anger to get even which be really important we talk in this chamber but often there be no action today we have talk and agree and hopefully there be go to be action that be most definitely parliament at its good question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time to stand committed to public bill committee standing order no free school meals automatic registration of eligible children bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time be very grateful for my good fortune in have the chance to introduce bill in my first year as member of this house and to seek to address in part one of my great policy concern childhood poverty the previous labour government make reduce child poverty one of their most significant mission in office and research by the institute for fiscal studies have demonstrate that without the change they make to benefit child poverty would have increase by more than quarter by instead it fall by more than quarter it be remarkable achievement under the circumstance unfortunately the action of the conservatives in the year since have reverse much of that good work today in one of the wealthy country in the world almost third of our child innocent who have no control whatsoever over their personal circumstance be live in poverty harold wilson famously say that the labour party be moral crusade or it be nothing if this government be to be judge on anything over the next five year let it be how they treat the most vulnerable member of our society like many member of my party have find the decision not to immediately lift the two child benefit cap extremely painful we do not need further report on how this policy be one of the most significant driver of child poverty under the previous government at this point do not believe the bookshelf of the house of commons library could support any more evidence be it to be submit however do accept that billion can not simply be find overnight if we be serious about end childhood poverty we need to consider all the issue in the round and the child poverty taskforce be vital part of ensure that limited public money be use most effectively to address this crisis what can we do here today while we await the finding of the taskforce to try to improve the condition of child live in poverty member will be aware that private member bills can not authorise new expenditure and do not seek to challenge that this bill seek simply to ensure that the child whom this house have already state should receive free school meal receive they automatically unless their parent actively opt out of the system it will not require penny more in expenditure than be necessary to fulfil the social contract that generation of parliaments have sustain with our poor child the requirement to qualify for free school meal be combine household income of or less an income of roughly half the average rent in my constituency find it hard to believe that it be possible to sustain household on such low income it be these child the bill seek to support the story we hear of child poverty be heartbreaking not only because of the hunger and the impact on child performance at school but because of the stigma with story of child pretend to bring food out of their bag so that they can fit in with their friend at school even when there be nothing available us former council leader have to stick together pay tribute to my hon friend for bring forward this bill as mention in my maiden speech be recipient of free school meal myself remember that stigma remember get blue ticket when go to get lunch with my friend while they get yellow one the stigma be still with today it run very deep in do he agree that the government child poverty taskforce have to consider everything in the round we should welcome the government announcement on free breakfast club and the roll out of the trial of those club do he also agree that we need to see urgency from the government and the minister as be sure we will to address this issue and to take systematic look at family and child in poverty absolutely agree be very grateful to my hon friend for his intervention the government be do lot to try to address this issue but that be not to say that we can not do more we hear those story of stigma with child pretend to bring food out of their bag so that they do not miss out or so that they fit in even if they do not have the actual food we should be glad that over the year since the system of free school meal have change so that people can not tell which child be in receipt of free school meal will come back to that point but it hopefully have encourage parent to make use of the option free school meal be estimate to save roughly child against such low income that amount make huge difference for family affect by the child benefit cap it would increase their income by fifth or more why give the difference that it could make to their household be every eligible family not claim there be range of reason in some case there be belief that their child might be bully due to be in receipt of free school meal as my hon friend the member for telford shaun davies mention if there be one immediate outcome of this debate hope it be to reinforce the message to parent that no one can now identify which child be on free school meal there be no stigma in claim please make the application we know also that the same barrier exist as with any other form of state support where barrier of language agency awareness and ability ensure that those face the great disadvantage in our society be the least likely to access the support available these be the family who would benefit most from this legislation this bill be so important exactly because of what my hon friend have just say it remove administrative barrier that get in the way but that can frequently be overcome sensibly importantly it still provide an opt out for parent which be important because not everybody would want to take this up for their child do he agree that this government should do everything they can to remove any administrative barrier it have be while since look at the number but my understanding when last look be that the level of unclaimed benefit in our system be at least time great than the total value of benefit fraud people be choose not to access the support available by and large because of stigma or lack of awareness but the impact within our society be real and we should be do everything we can to reduce that stigma we all pay in so that there be safety net for we when we need it and to ensure that other member of our community our neighbour and the people we care about do not have to go without when they fall on difficult time we should do everything possible to avoid the vilification that be disgustingly often put upon people simply because they be poor beyond the moral argument this measure be about the future of our country education be an investment in the future prosperity of our country and of our citizen it be the bedrock of economic growth and of enable people to live independent and successful life auto enrolment stand to improve educational outcome in three way the most obvious be by reduce hunger the impact of which upon concentration and educational performance be well know school meal be introduce year ago next year to ensure that child receive at least one nutritious meal day so that they could function effectively secondly auto enrolment would improve household income and household income be positively correlate with educational outcome in fact there be double digit improvement in performance at gcse level between child in the low and second low income decile and that improvement continue all the way up in decrease amount until we hit the third high decile where for all the money spend on private school educational outcome plateau across the top of income thank my hon friend for the speech he be make and for put child poverty at its heart on educational outcome do he agree that auto enrol child would mean that school could take advantage of many of the gateway support that be premise on how many child at school be on free school meal be sure that like he will have speak to school carry heavy level of debt that be school dinner debt because they be have to provide meal for hungry child agree with my hon friend be well aware of the amount of effort that local school be have to make directly to deal with the consequence of financial deprivation it be important that we try to ensure that the statistic on free school meal be accurate because it be gateway to support it be also how we measure any number of indicator of poverty in our society if there be statistical link between some group under reporting compare with other group we will have inaccurate figure on where deprivation be in our society and how good to try to address that problem the last benefit of auto enrolment relate to the pupil premium of pupil which be design to counter the impact of deprivation on educational outcome it be payment that school receive on the basis of the number of pupil in receipt of free school meal low uptake of free school meal be now directly limit the funding available to those school where it would make the most difference to educational outcome as government who be ambitious for the education of our child and commit to secure high level of economic growth the failure to address these matter of deprivation be hurdle that we have to clear if we be go to succeed this be well recognise the education committee recently report we consider that the argument for auto enrolment in free school meal for those child currently eligible be conclusive in the interest of alleviate hunger in school and improve health and educational outcome for the poor child auto enrolment must be bring in without delay pilot run by local authority which quite heavily bend the rule set by current legislation to try to get as many of their child register as possible have repeatedly show over recent year the scale of under registration and the impact that auto enrolment could have both for those family benefit and for school funding in deprive community the government own figure suggest that under registration stand at minimum of which be equivalent to quarter of million child although research nationally and in my own constituency suggest that the overall figure could well be significantly high it be worth note that the income threshold cut off the overwhelming majority of child who be live in poverty in this country who still do not qualify for free school meal that should certainly be correct in due course but for now this bill would make the most amount of difference to the very poor child benefit they their family their school and through improvement in educational outcome society at large accept that the mess the new government have inherit from the last government and the economic uncertainty create by decision currently be take in washington mean that it may be too much to expect wholesale adoption of the policy today however hope that the minister who have be generous with his time with on this matter and have demonstrate his commitment to increase the uptake of free school meal will be able to give commitment that auto enrolment will be give serious consideration as part of the work now be undertake to bring an end to childhood poverty in the united kingdom also hope that today debate will underline the support among member of this house for bring about this change on behalf of our most vulnerable constituent surely the very least that our country have right to expect of its parliament be that we will ensure that the nation child be feed it be privilege to follow my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb be so happy that his name be draw in the private member bill ballot and that he have choose this excellent subject and most important topic for his bill as my hon friend say school food have be available for almost year that be thank to an mp for bradford little know by most call fred jowett who introduce the concept in his private member bill in my hon friend follow in the footstep of great man and thank he for that free school meal have exist in one form or another for the good part of year mean that countless generation of child have receive hot nutritious meal at lunch time they be life change for pupil no one know that well than do grow up as recipient of free school meal from almost the day start school to the day leave school the knowledge that there would be food at lunch time give my mam and my brother the security that would not be hungry go into the rest of the school day echo the feeling of stigma that my hon friend the members for crawley and for telford shaun davies have speak about also recall have different dinner ticket and even bad have different meal queue to stand in our queue be serve after the pay for child be serve it be horrify know be glad to say that that do not happen any more child be not separate in such an abhorrent way but the stigma be still very real and alive today no matter how hard school try to alleviate it through cashless system and so on ask any child in school who be the child on free school meal and they will look to they straightaway they all know have be to many school over year always ask they and they always nod sheepishly that they know sometimes because they be that very child but sometimes because they know who those other child be that stigma never leave you it stay with you and in the sixth rich economy in the world we should not be subject our child in school to that stigma any long we be all aware of the countless cross cut benefit of free school meal so will not waste the house time by reliste they all will only say that from increase attendance to attainment and more free school meal be multifaceted policy with widespread benefit across society be proud to be the founder and current chair of the all party parliamentary group on school food since the group be instrumental in shape the universal infant free school meal scheme along with the author of the school food plan henry dimbleby and john vincent and we be still in discussion on the good delivery of the universal primary breakfast club programme we the mps involve and all the stakeholder who think number now all want the early adopter to be huge success the all party parliamentary group meet only yesterday and the wilson room be pack the group be always well attend by school food stakeholder we have around in attendance yesterday but have know we to fill committee room with to attendee and hope the minister know he have an open invitation to attend when his diary allow the early adopter scheme due to roll out to the first school this april will show we where lesson can be learn for smooth introduction to all primary school next year but as my hon friend the member for crawley have already say this government can and should go far we can make marginal low cost improvement to the statutory free school meal scheme that we already have by introduce an opt out system as outline in the bill we will capture around child who be eligible for this crucial support but be not currently receive it admin barrier should not mean that one in student whose household income be already below the threshold before benefit miss out on free school meal support when they need it most this auto enrolment bill can not be see as extra spending government funding already exist for the child who be not claim this statutory support so it be the low of low hang fruit moreover increase free school meal uptake unlock as we have hear whole host of other benefit include vital pupil premium funding of up to extra per child if this house want to talk about well education funding surely unlock funding that already exist be the most logical and economically efficient way of do that in closing extend free school meal by automatic registration to these most needy child should be no brainer for any government and moral imperative for this labour government hope to see this government and this minister rectify that at their early opportunity congratulate the hon member for crawley peter lamb on promote this bill so ably the last conservative government massively expand eligibility for free school meal mean that the proportion of child and young people eligible be much high than be the case under any previous government the evidence here prove that the inheritance we leave behind in this area last july be much kind than that which the last labour government leave we in with one in three child able to get free school meal as oppose to one in six when the previous labour government be last in office despite large fall in the number of workless household we see in the body of child increase stunting with the average year old cm short than they be in how do that square with what the minister be say we see malnutrition crisis when we look at dietary habit in recent decade we see that that be not confine to part of the income spectrum there have be deterioration in the quality of diet go back over several decade that be quite separate from issue of poverty as of january more than million pupil be eligible for benefit relate free school meal which amount to of all pupil in addition more than disadvantaged student in further education receive free school meal at lunch time collectively this support the child and young people who need it most to ensure that they could make the most of their world class education boost their health and save their parent considerable amount that they could not afford will the hon gentleman give way really must continue the government have promise to move on to the next bill at quarter to two so need to keep intervention to minimum we also introduce extensive protection which have be in effect since they ensure that while universal credit be be fully roll out any child eligible for free school meal would retain their entitlement and keep get free school meal until the end of the phase in other word until they complete either primary or secondary school if their family income rise above the income threshold such that that would otherwise have stop on breakfast club we all know that breakfast be the most important meal of the day set people up with the fuel they need to make the most of the day ahead and the evidence support that at this point madam deputy speaker ought to declare an interest my wife be in teaching although she be provide one to one special need teach rather than in classroom at the moment we know that those child who do not have breakfast be more likely to have issue with behaviour wellbee and learn that be why the previous government expand the provision of breakfast invest up to million in the national school breakfast programme that funding support school in disadvantaged area provide thousand of child from low income family with free nutritious breakfast at school to support their attainment wellbee and readiness to learn moreover we trust school leader to deliver build breakfast provision that fit the need of their pupil that involve five different model range from traditional breakfast club to healthy grab and go the programme have have great success in support those who need it most and welcome the minister confirmation that his party will continue to support it until at least next march hope the support extend past that date nutrition do not cease to be an issue outside of term time which be why the previous government roll out the holiday activity and food programme to support during holiday period disadvantaged and low income family in receipt of free school meal since the programme have deliver enriching activity and nutritious food to the child and young people who need it most with more than million each year deliver million half day to child and young people across every single one of the local authority in england the bill require local authority in england to identify each child of school age resident in its area who be eligible for free school meal it also require state fund school that identify child who be eligible to provide those meal we support the desire to ensure that all those eligible for free school meal have an opportunity to receive they so do not wish to prevent the bill from proceed however have couple of question about how the bill will achieve that which hope that the bill promoter can address in his closing remark so that member can consider that as the bill proceed know that the hon member for crawley have extensive experience in local government and think that local authority have now pilot their own auto enrolment scheme at some point in draft the bill what consideration do he give to the burden that will be add to local authority do he have any assessment or measure of the cost for local council tax payer and how that relate to both the saving for local family and the additional income for school through pupil premium the bill would also give power to the secretary of state to make regulation to make provision for the definition of the term state fund school in what circumstance do the hon member believe that change in definition will be necessary will be clear as we be in government that we believe in target support to where it be most need we believe that the state should do less but do it well but that do include deliver sufficient support to those who need it most and particularly to child and young people thank my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb for his bill and for provide the opportunity to consider the importance that free nutritious meal have in break the link between background and achievement he be true champion for his constituent and for child and family across the country be delighted to meet he to discuss the bill and hear how passionate he be about our opportunity mission also thank my hon friend the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson who have be champion for free school meal provision in this place for considerable time also thank she for her leadership on the appg be proud to serve under this mission drive government who be break down the barrier to opportunity for every child in every part of our country we currently spend about billion annually on free lunch for million school pupil under benefit base free school meal alongside over disadvantaged student in further education and about million infant under universal infant free school meal we consider the aim of those measure at their core to be to ensure that those who need it get the support that they be entitle to which be goal that we be supportive of free lunch programme provide pupil with essential nutrition support attendance and ultimately ensure that pupil can concentrate learn and get the most out of their education they be essential to break down barrier to opportunity and tackle child poverty task that be more important than ever as result of the legacy of rise child poverty leave behind by the previous government shamefully there be more child in poverty than in and over million child be now grow up in low income family that be why be proud of new ministerial taskforce that be work urgently to develop child poverty strategy to address that the child poverty taskforce be consider range of lever to tackle child poverty include key cost driver for household such as food to develop comprehensive strategy that will be publish later this year that be in addition to action that we be already take to deliver on our mission to break down barrier to opportunity by roll out free breakfast club in every state fund primary school provide food and childcare to child and to socialise they before the school day as well as put more money back into parent pocket on average year far the holiday activity and food programme which be establish in every local authority area in england and deliver vital support to child and family during school holiday will again receive more than million in we facilitate the claiming of free meal by provide the eligibility checking system digital portal available to local authority that make verifying eligibility for free lunch quick and simple can tell the house that the checking system have be redesign to allow parent and school to check eligibility independently from their local authority this system will make it quick and easy to check eligibility for school meal and have the potential to far boost take up by family meet the eligibility criterion far to that my department be aware of range of measure that be be implement by local authority to boost the take up of free lunch we welcome locally lead approach and be personally keen to learn from they by work directly with their community local authority can overcome the barrier to register and take action to ensure that family have access to the support for which they be eligible subject to those activity meet legal requirement include those on data protection to support those local effort my department be work with the department for science innovation and technology on explore legal gateway that can enable well datum sharing in the meantime we will continue to engage with range of stakeholder include family and young people as have do personally to understand the barrier for household that meet the criterion for free lunch but be not claim they include through work closely with local authority to understand the approach that they have take in conclusion thank my hon friend the member for crawley for bring forward this bill we all agree that it address matter of great importance hope it be apparent from my remark that the government be supportive of the aim of the bill we be work with the department for science innovation and technology to explore legal gateway that could enable well datum sharing and there be further consideration of improve free school meal enrolment through the work of the child poverty taskforce this government be determined to break down the barrier to opportunity for every child our work to simplify enrolment be important to achieve that aim we be confident that the action have outline will improve take up of free meal alongside the local work be trialle by many local authority across the country for that reason hope that my hon friend can be encourage to withdraw his bill while we continue to explore enrolment and keep free school meal under review congratulate my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb on his private member bill on this very important topic and on his excellent speech it be well establish fact that good nutrition be essential for child brain development and learning when child go to school without eat nutritious meal or eat at all it have detrimental effect on their behaviour and educational performance barnardo late research nourish the future find that in school say hunger and food insecurity be impact on child ability to learn include poor concentration tiredness and behavioural problem as school governor know the challenge that school face in deal with challenge behaviour and get child to learn so anything that help improve behaviour and learning be to be welcome free school meal be mean to be lifeline for low income family they be mean to ensure that the most disadvantaged child in society get free nutritious meal every day that they be in school to help they concentrate learn and achieve however accord to the child poverty action group over child across the uk do not qualify for free school meal because of restrictive qualifying criterion accord to the food foundation further eligible child be miss out on free school meal for variety of reason include lack of awareness stigma or embarrassment the complexity of the form the minister refer to the previous checking system or language barrier the fact that obtain free school meal be an opt in process require parent or carer to apply be itself barrier if we want our child to flourish thrive and get the good start in life that need to change as the minister mention one of the labour party five mission be to break down barrier to opportunity and believe this be one of those barrier the solution be auto enrolment for free school meal as set out in the speech by my hon friend the member for crawley however he be not the only person to call for such change that call have come from many quarter in the conservative government commission henry dimbleby co founder of the restaurant chain leon to produce food strategy for the department for environment food and rural affairs recommendation of the strategy be to extend eligibility for free school meal and one of the three way to achieve that recommendation be to enrol eligible child for free school meal automatically the rationale for that recommendation be that even eligible child be often miss out currently fsm be opt in parent have to know about the scheme and apply for it the effect of this be that accord to estimate by the dfe of child entitle to fsms do not receive they in the benefit section of recommendation it be note that this would have benefit for those child health but also for their educational achievement follow one pilot of universal free school meal in primary school pupil make between four and eight week more progress than expect pupil from poor family and those who have previously do less well at school show the most improvement it be state that there be clear education and health benefit in child have nutritious free school meal and that come from the conservative government food strategy sadly as with many of the recommendation auto enrolment be not implement more recently the education committee scrutiny of the children wellbeing and schools bill report of february state at paragraph that the argument for auto enrolment in free school meal for those child currently eligible be conclusive in the interest of alleviate hunger in school and improve health and educational outcome for the poor child auto enrolment must be bring in without delay we be lucky in london that the mayor of london sir sadiq khan have agree to fund free lunch for all london child in state primary school which be already make difference to child educational outcome it be shame that this policy do not apply to secondary school too but in the absence of such policy auto enrolment be the good way to ensure all eligible child get the free school meal that they be entitle to and deserve if we be to ensure that child get the good start in life learn and thrive at school and achieve to their full potential auto enrolling of eligible child on to free school meal be the good way forward we need to remove that barrier to opportunity and this would at stroke make huge difference to those child life the government be already do many good thing in education and the announcement of the breakfast club early adopter be warmly welcome by and be sure colleague on both side of the house hope that the government will adopt this policy because it help alleviate child poverty be good for child and be the right thing to do hear what the minister say about the child poverty taskforce strategy and look forward to it report later in the year on what it would do to challenge child poverty datum sharing be obviously to be welcome and know that the government will do all they can to ensure that all eligible child get the free school meal that they deserve to help they learn and thrive pay tribute to my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb for bring forward this private member bill on process that as former council leader see as bureaucratic red tape nightmare child eligible for free school meal be not access they simply because form be not fill in even though local authority school and community know exactly who those child be bureaucracy be get in the way be pleased to hear the minister say at the dispatch box that he be work with the department for science innovation and technology to look at way in which datum sharing and passporte benefit check could be use to ensure that more child get food however this must be look at in the round hear from constituent this week who have just take their child out of breakfast club because the cost of the club have go up by week sadly that school be not one of the early adopter of breakfast club but it will benefit from that policy initiative as it be roll out it be an excellent initiative and we should be proud of it we should call on the government to go hard fast in implement the policy some more child in working household be live in poverty in than in that mean that child enter poverty every single week for the first year the conservatives be in power in my area telford absolute poverty rise from to between and and we know that huge number of family who be not include in the poverty figure be also struggle to make end meet ultimately we need an economy that be grow and get people into work so that the poverty trap can be remove like the shadow minister declare an interest my wife be primary school teacher in telford she tell about the direct contrast between the child she teach now and the cohort that she teach when she start year ago child be come in with major social issue and those social issue have to be address as whole the government also need to consider the huge regional inequality in deprivation child poverty in some part of the country go down under the last conservative government but in my region it soar we need to engage with council and where applicable with combined authority and mayor to ensure systematic approach my hon friend mention work with region may add point about nation in wales all primary school child have be eligible for free school meal since september last year do my hon friend agree that in design the roll out of free school meal in england the uk government could learn from the experience in wales absolutely agree my county border wales so know wales very well indeed the westminster government should absolutely learn from the welsh labour government approach to child poverty and to inequality more generally we should congratulate and acknowledge the work of welsh labour in that space welcome the previous government household support fund and its extension by this government as council leader and as chair of the local government association work with conservative ministers on the fund the approach and ideal be absolutely right but the one year duration mean that the money be not be use to the good possible extent that go back to the point about the importance of cross ministerial taskforce look at the issue in the round we have hear lot this week from the prime minister downwards about the need for delivery about urgent action and about the ability to make difference and demonstrate change as labour government we can not be in position where in four or five year time we point to bureaucracy and red tape as the reason why we have not make huge impact on the life of the poor child in our country be grateful for the opportunity that the bill provide to put on record the importance of discuss the scourge of child poverty in our country particularly as it relate to child nutrition it be simple fact that the height of an average five year old increase progressively until but have since reverse child age five be short today than in the past we face dual burden not only stunt but obesity we have see increase in obesity since and increase in teenager with type diabete since all of this point to the poverty of child diet in this country when we have this conversation for it be never matter of what we can afford to do we can not afford not to do something about it because the knock on in the nhs be immense and the knock on in future work day miss by the next generation will be immense it be sad reality that as my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb say in typical uk classroom one third of child will be live in relative poverty child be also the group most likely to be live in cold home in this country probably the most startling statistic from my county of durham which really show what austerity have do to our child over the last decade and half be the increase in the number of child in the care system the cost of that for the local taxpayer be immense as be the human and social cost for those child but somewhere between be in the care system and be happy child with healthy life be many child who live in condition of neglect that be why it be so important that the state and school sometimes do the work to provide what child be not get in the home hope that the child poverty taskforce will report soon and we will see some positive change welcome the breakfast club introduce by the government which will make difference not only to ensure that child start the day well feed and have settle but to the cost of living meet constituent few month ago who share with that it cost she month just to pay for her child to be look after from till the start of the school day that be have massive impact on she so for she that breakfast club be an extra month and be grateful for that what be be propose today be modest and sensible tweak that address the challenge of child not be enrol be grateful to the minister for say that the government will look at this issue because we can not afford to allow generation of child to grow up as they be right now the bill aim to make meaningful and lasting difference to the life of child across our country we must come together to focus on the future of our young people understand that the way we invest in they today be how we shape our society of tomorrow the government have be clear in their commitment to address child poverty welcome that and the work already be do through the ministerial taskforce which be shape long term strategy to bring about change that commitment be also evident in the king speech which announce further investment in child wellbee through the introduction of breakfast club which also welcome financial support for the least well off be another key element of our approach as former councillor know that the additional billion allocate in the most recent budget to the household support fund will allow local authority to provide target help to those who need it most we must always ensure that support for family be not just well intentione but well deliver that be why the bill be so important it remove unnecessary barrier streamline the process so that every eligible child be automatically register for the help to which they be entitle no family should have to navigate unnecessary bureaucracy or miss out due to lack of awareness at the same time the bill respect parental choice which be incredibly important it be essential to recognise that the most effective way to reduce poverty and improve life chance be by focus on long term sustainable economic growth by foster strong economy we can boost household income and ensure that public service remain well funded and effective the long term vision must always be to create an environment where family can thrive child can reach their full potential and the cycle of poverty can be break for good while we work towards that vision it be important to continue implement practical well target measure such as those in the bill that can bring about immediate improvement the decision we make today will shape the society we live in tomorrow before enter this place work on poverty for the child poverty action group oxfam and church action on poverty back in there be cross party consensus that we should end child poverty gordon brown refer to it as his guide mission should we return to that time completely agree gordon brown be wonderful prime minister to conclude the bill represent crucial step in our ongoing commitment to tackle child poverty order that the debate be now wakeford debate to be resume on friday july arm length bodies review bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time as you will know madam deputy speaker timing be important in politic when last autumn choose today for the second reading of the bill how could have predict that arm length body which will abbreviate to albs would have be mention four time in the times leader this very morning nor could have predict the generosity of the government whips in allow indeed facilitate debate on this important bill first introduce the bill in the session but dissolution prevent it from be debate have to say do not think the government who be in office at that time would have be very responsive to the content of the bill it be therefore beyond my wild dream that labour government seem to understand at least in part the problem that arm length body present to parliament particularly to the house of commons and the ministers through their unaccountable structure as the times leader this morning put it arm length body have often be favour by minister as way of distance themselves from contentious issue but the result be often duplication of effort result in turf war between whitehall ministry and albs over policy free of the need to answer to voter alb can go rogue as highways england do over its promotion in the face of public opposition of so call smart motorway for another current topical example of that problem one need look no far than the sentencing council early this month on march that independent arm length body issue new guideline for the sentencing of offender from minority group that issue be take up by the shadow secretary of state for justice my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick during the question that follow statement by the justice secretary my right hon friend challenge the justice secretary by point out that the new sentencing guideline would make custodial sentence less likely for those from an ethnic minority cultural minority faith minority community in her response the justice secretary say as somebody from an ethnic minority background do not stand for any differential treatment before the law for anyone there will never be two tier sentencing approach under my report march vol within hour however it become apparent that the justice secretary do not have the control that she think she have over the activity of the sentencing council the new guideline due to be implement from april remain unaltered and unaffected by what both the secretary of state for justice and her shadow have say to this house understand from today newspaper that yesterday there be meeting between the justice secretary and the chairman of the sentencing council lord justice william davis would have expect to have see in the same press release that lord justice william davis have now concede to the justice secretary who think speak for everybody in this house by say that we should not have two tier justice system would have think that he would have accept that he get it wrong and the new guideline would be withdraw before april however that do not seem to have happen yet we now know that the guideline be the subject of quite critical comment when they go out to consultation include from the magistrates association which describe they as get out of jail free card why have we set up system whereby the sentencing council be able to dictate this type of policy override the will of ministers and elect member of parliament respect the point that the hon member be make about the sentencing council but give that this issue have be around for the past few year he say that the guideline be out for consultation why do he think the previous government be unable to take any action on it can not speak for the previous government because be not member although obviously be in the house my understanding be that this have become live issue only within recent week and month and that the present government have be involve in discussion behind the scene be not blame the justice secretary because think that perhaps her official misread what she say or perhaps do not understand the need to consult she they seem to have be to meeting with the sentencing council it be my understanding that the consultation process come to conclusion after the present government come into office we should all agree that we need to try to find way through bill promote by my right hon friend the member for newark which be on the order paper today the sentencing council powers of secretary of state bill would enable the house and the minister to take back control from the sentencing council over issue relate to sentencing policy and guidance would find it amazing if the government seek to block progress on that bill today there be everything to be say for it go through all stage in the house in one day because it be essentially an emergency measure in response to the fact that so far the sentencing council do not seem to have respond positively to the representation of the justice secretary the sentencing council be not unique in be able to ignore the wish of ministers and parliament most arm length body have similar status to the sentencing council they be in three different category executive agency non departmental public body and non ministerial department they have slightly vary relationship with the house and with government but there be far too many of they how many arm length body be there be tell by cabinet office minister in response to my question that on july last year there be arm length body and of those have an annual operating expenditure in excess of million in although the minister duck my other question of how many there be now we know that since come into office the government have remove one quango and create new one although the prime minister have take some decisive action on one quango there be heck of lot of other that hope will come under his scrutiny my bill seek to ensure that the most significant quango be accountable to parliament give the prime minister announcement yesterday do the hon member welcome the announcement that the large of those organisation be to be move within ministerial and departmental oversight be just come to that have to say that be absolutely delighted be not ambivalent about it it be really good news and will give some example of how frustrating it have be in my constituency to try to engage with the organisation call nhs dorset it use to be call the integrate care board and how difficult it have be to get any timely response be delighted that the prime minister obviously agree with the objective of the bill whereas this bill inevitably have to tread carefully around the subject matter the good way of get parliamentary accountability of the activity of arm length body be to abolish those body completely which be what the prime minister announce yesterday be very much aware that the hon member have be member of this chamber for much long than and many of my colleague have give that many of we be elect for the first time last july but do he recall that between and the labour government cut the number of quango in this country by that show what labour do in government wait until the end of the five year and see how many we have cut by then be sure he will be delight by the number be more interested actually in look at the number of people in the civil service there be low point during the blair year but be sorry to report that under the last conservative government and in the time that this government have be in office the number of civil servant have continue to increase exponentially we be talk about between and more civil servant since the brexit referendum the size of the state the government and the civil service be important issue and they be fundamental to this but my bill focus on try to ensure that the official who be pay handsomely by the taxpayer be more accountable than they have be to this house and the government the prime minister say yesterday that these quango and regulator end up block what the government want to do and that be obviously unsatisfactory in democracy we elect government and we expect they to take action on our behalf could the hon gentleman enlighten on slight confusion have with the wording of his bill the government be talk about bring more of these agency back under executive control so that the executive elect by the british people can drive their performance his bill would provide direct parliamentary control which in many case such as with the prison service which be oversee by the ministry of justice would move control and oversight from the executive to parliament may be confuse but would the bill not make some of that hard not easy do not think my bill would make any of that hard what be say be that if the government wish to abolish these arm length body or some of they and to create more direct relationship between the activity of those body when they be under direct government control and this house welcome that have already make that clear however the government have already show that they be intent on increase the number of arm length body later be go to come on to what regard as an egregious example of give substantial new power to an arm length body namely the power for natural england set out in the planning and infrastructure bill that be publish early this week will come on to that in due course what be important be that these arm length body be not able to go on frolic of their own and ignore the wish of the people representative as such my bill attempt to remedy that accountability gap as have be say the most direct way of do that be to abolish the arm length body altogether currently the government be indeed legislate to abolish one arm length body through the institute for apprenticeships and technical education transfer of functions etc bill be chair that bill committee stage yesterday so will not comment on its merit or otherwise but its proposal be dwarf by the announcement of the abolition of nhs england welcome that decision as say early have constituency concern about the way in which nhs england outpost in dorset nhs dorset lack responsiveness to member of parliament to give the house topical example from this week indeed it be still go on the continue healthcare department at nhs dorset have fail over many month to sort out an issue relate to quadriplegic who be one of my constituent he have now move into different residential care home and his social worker be from the nhs continue healthcare team as we speak he be threaten with lose his mobility vehicle this very weekend because of the nhs inability to deal with the department for work and pensions and sort the matter out this very week my constituent mother write to and immediately try to contact nhs dorset have send an email and leave phone message with both the social worker and the organisation and my secretary be busy phone today to try to get response no response be forthcoming from nhs dorset and in my view that be unacceptable that be just small example of the problem which hope will be properly address by bring nhs england back under direct control of the government it would mean for example that would be able to put down question about this matter could try to table an urgent question for the minister that direct accountability be think what lord lansley be try to avoid when he be secretary of state it be an embarrassment to the conservative government the coalition government that they could be ask question by mp on the sort of subject have just raise yet what more important role be there for an mp than try to drive through these bureaucratic block and deliver what our constituent be expect the case of the hon member constituent be really interesting one although do not know the full detail however sometimes when we get rid of quango it be case of be careful what you wish for one of the job have before come to this place be parliamentary officer for the public and commercial services union one much lament former body from the bonfire of the quango be the independent living fund which provide support for some of the most complex case potentially like the hon gentleman constituent and be able to work much more easily in cost save measure that support be transfer into local government and local government be much less efficient at administer it so would say be careful what you wish for when you close quango just because they be quango hear the hon gentleman cautionary tale and be not suggest that anything will be panacea my bill be just tentative step to try to introduce little more accountability my hon friend be make powerful speech and agree entirely with the point he be make as recall from the coalition day one of the reason for the lansley reform be to make the nhs more independent of government which clearly fail my personal view be that all these arm length body quango and so on should be within the departments then as he say we would be able to question ministers on the issue the idea that we should make they independent of their political master be something we need to overturn absolutely that be why although the term independent sound seductive to people outside it quite often mean lack of control by elect representative over the body in question be not go to spend all my time talk about nhs dorset but must offer one other illustration of my concern have letter here from the chief executive of nhs dorset who think receive lot more remuneration than even the prime minister write to she in november and she write back at the end of january about an issue relate to dermatology service in dorset write back to she say what be be do to address this issue you have answer that in your letter it take until march with further query follow up on it for to receive an answer the letter cite my question which first raise back in november as concern over the unacceptably long waiting list for dermatology service what be be do to address this issue by the integrated care board the answer give be as part of commissioning for sustainability programme dermatology be one of the service that be be focusse on the aim of the programme be to recover service to the week standard target whilst maintain sustainability as part of this we be currently review how the commissioning and delivery of service can well achieve this that be after more than four month there be no suggestion of when the review start when it be likely to end or what will happen take that as an example of the member of parliament be fob off by officialdom for have the temerity to raise an important issue on behalf of his constituent could go on with many other example from nhs but will not do that instead will see whether through this debate can encourage the government to go far than just abolish nhs england have have many dealing with the nhs business services authority another arm length body apparently control by the department of health and social care but essentially law unto itself have be in dealing with the nhsbsa on number of different subject but particularly on the subject of the access and treatment of people who suffer vaccine damage and have apply for vaccine damage payment the nhsbsa be responsible for organise and run that scheme yet progress in deal with application be desperately slow as at last november it have more than claim relate to vaccine but of those more than be await resolution and some have be wait more than month to be resolve once claim have be reject as it often be the claimant have an opportunity to go for mandatory reversal application before they can get access to tribunal dissatisfied claimant can go for the mandatory reversal but the nhsbsa can hold up that process as at february this year reject claim have be subject to mandatory reversal some of those be outstanding and have be outstanding for more than year that be intolerable because it can take more than year for someone to have their claim dismiss they then get mandatory reversal and need to go to tribunal after three year someone right to litigate on this subject be take away by the limitation period that be an example of what happen when department and arm length body start take over and be thoroughly incompetent if the hon gentleman be so concerned about that why do he vote for the health and social care bill which include the setting up of nhs england on march be probably in one of my less rebellious period at that stage but the hon gentleman be right to chide because think it be big mistake this be such fundamental issue for the hon member so why should we pay any attention whatever to what he be say to we today be not insist that anybody should pay attention to what be say all be put forward be proposition that these arm length body of which there be far too many should be bring to account more than they be at the moment have just give an example of the nhs business services authority another example be natural england one of the mean by which arm length body be mean to be accountable to parliament be through the publication of annual report with account if one look at the situation with natural england it have not produce an annual report and account for the year end march the last account it produce be in december for the financial year end march that be unacceptable the government guidance be that these arm length body should produce their report and account within three month of the end of the financial year in light of what the hon member be say will he support labour planning and infrastructure bill which take away natural england power to delay or stop the building of vital infrastructure include energy and rail infrastructure and the million home that we need in this country the hon lady tempt to move on to the planning and infrastructure bill before the hon gentleman move on from natural england in my constituency we have get huge problem with the whinney hill tip which natural england and the environment agency be both heavily involve in my resident face horrendous issue with gull the stink and many other challenge from that tip but we have be limit in find an alternative because elect official need to plan for an alternative waste station if the environment agency have great tooth it might have be able to push the issue and find well solution be it not sometimes about have the right power in place rather than remove quango altogether that intervention be slightly broad in scope but it return at the end the environment agency as an arm length body be find want in many respect not least that it argue that it have lack of resource to introduce the necessary prosecution and enforcement of the regulation that it be mean to be in charge of just to illustrate that point this also relate to natural england actually towards the end of the last parliament arrange with the then minister at the department for environment food and rural affairs to have meeting in his office with official from natural england and the environment agency to discuss the state of the avon valley the river the nitrate and phosphate problem and the break in the avon valley footpath which cross the river avon in my constituency but as result of neglect be no long viable the minister set up the meeting in his department the first time go along to the department with he he be sit there with his private secretary and we be mean to have official from natural england and the environment agency with we online on zoom do not know whether they be work from home but nothing happen at the last minute there be message say that they could not attend say to the minister that he should get heavy with they because this be intolerable it be another month or six week before we have an in person meet with they wish that could say to the hon member for hyndburn sarah smith that as result of all that the issue have be resolve but they have not have get meeting with natural england on site on april in the avon valley in my constituency all be not well with these arm length body there be probably different solution for resolve that depend on their specific nature the former paymaster general the right hon member for salisbury john glen say in guidance that alb be closely align but distinct from their sponsor department and so on it continue that albs be each responsible to parliament for their use of public fund be that not contrary to what the hon gentleman seem to be tell we who be right he or the former paymaster general that be the difference between the word and the reality strictly speak be come on to this they have to produce annual report and account which go to what be describe as their sponsor departments in most case the sponsor department lay those account before the house with natural england for example we do not know what have be go on since march so it be accountable but not in what would describe as meaningful sense such that we can ask specific question on the point about arm length body and their accountability to parliament do my hon friend agree that it would be useful to have mechanism to bring they to parliament to hold they to account not just through their annual account if there be gross negligence in department or an arm length body particularly those that deal in medical or other delicate matter or if there be some issue that need to be bring to the fore we could have mechanism for they to come to parliament so that there could be direct parliamentary accountability although it be say in theory that those body be accountable to we there be no evidence to show that that be the case my hon friend take back to the content of my bill which seek to achieve exactly what she request clause state house of commons approval of relevant document within period of forty day start on the day on which relevant document be lay before the house of commons by or on behalf of qualifying body minister of the crown must move motion that the house of commons approve the relevant document that mean that we in the house would be able to decide whether we approve that document the bill go on to say if the house of commons do not approve motion under subsection the relevant document shall stand refer to the committee of public accounts it seem to that the good body that we have in the house to deal with this sort of situation would be the public accounts committee so there would be an automatic referral to that committee if the member of this house decide that they be dissatisfied with the performance of the relevant arm length body have the hon gentleman have any discussion with the chair of the public accounts committee the hon member for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown to assess how much of the committee time would be take up with go through the account of potentially quango which would be directly responsible to parliament quangos be not directly responsible to parliament which be why have bring forward the bill rise be not go to give way any more but will just make this comment the hon gentleman seem to be intent on find reason for not take action in this area and to block progress may suggest that he pursue an alternative career in the civil service because that be exactly the sort of role that he would be well suit to the planning and infrastructure bill be publish this week it give extensive and revised power to natural england which have not even produce its annual report for last year instead of abolish natural england which might have be the right approach follow the prime minister abolition of nhs england so that the relevant responsibility could be take on by the department for environment food and rural affairs directly clause to of the planning and infrastructure bill give natural england an unelected arm length body responsibility for environmental delivery plan the administration and control of the nature restoration levy and whole lot of other responsibility which would be well suit to the government so that there be more direct accountability can see why the government be frustrate at the delay by natural england have experience that in my own constituency where there be ridiculous attempt by somebody to try to build new open air surfing lake although the site be only three mile from the coast they want to build that new infrastructure but natural england sit on the responsibility of advise on the project and refuse to take action keep ask the planning inspector what we could do about that and the answer be nothing we have to wait until natural england get round to decide what it be go to do if anything which add month there be development site in the middle of christchurch former police station as result of natural england faffe about over phosphate the cost of develop the site have increase by over million and there be significant delay of probably two year or more the government need to take these power back into the department rather than as set out in the planning and infrastructure bill give even more power to natural england which be an unelected and scarcely accountable quango the hon gentleman be talk about natural england and nhs england which obviously operate only in england be he aware that in another part of the uk scotland we have see an absolute proliferation of quango under the snp we now have more quango in scotland than there be member of the scottish parliament do he like look forward to the day when the snp no long run the scottish government and labour administration promise to crack down on these thing although be educate at university in scotland will not get draw into scottish politic but there be lot to be say for have united kingdom approach to all these issue in some respect we have probably devolve too much power to the scottish government for thing that should more properly be deal with by the united kingdom parliament we hear in today debate on the rare cancers bill that its clause and be specifically limit to england and wales although it be very important bill about research on rare cancer it would not apply to scotland that be big problem but we will not get into that now because be try to confine my remark to the several hundred arm length body do not have time to go through any more example but the government seem to have undergo conversion suddenly they have see the light and realise that they need to take back control will use an anecdote to illustrate my proposition when be minister in the department for the environment we have storey tower block in marsham street be privileged to be junior minister and nick ridley be my secretary of state for those who do not know he he be passionately in favour of the freedom of people to smoke if they so wish one day he arrive in the tower block and there be big notice in the lift say no smoking in this lift which cause he to say in stage whisper can somebody remind who in charge of this department needless to say the notice be quickly remove when he be secretary of state he give the responsibility of deal with mega quango the property services agency which be responsible for massive delay and add cost to the building of the british library for example he imbue in feeling that minister be in charge one day the permanent secretary who be responsible for the property services agency go behind my back and basically say to nick ridley that be responsible for significant decline in the morale of the people work for the property services agency and he ask whether the secretary of state could intervene the secretary of state say to the gentleman in question sir gordon chris be in charge of the property services agency if you wish to discuss anything with he then be sure his door be always open he report that back to and from that moment onwards the relationship change the minister be back in charge and the civil servant recognise that they be in subordinate and accountable role hope that be exactly what will happen now with nhs england and lot of other arm length body as result of the government conversion to recognise the deputy speaker

question propose that this house do now wakeford be grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue in the house want to focus on the impact that inflation have have on the ability of different institution to deliver the community project and mitigation that high speed previously agree to in mid buckinghamshire the case be many in number but will illustrate the scale of the problem with particular attention to two press concern noise mitigation measure for st mary church in wendover and the provision of new ground and facility for wendover cricket club have be deeply controversial across my mid buckinghamshire constituency and the wide county make no bone about my absolute and total opposition to which be well document many of my constituent have suffer greatly as result of the disruption that it have cause from environmental damage to the impact on home business and local amenity as well as the damage to our local infrastructure that be not to mention the hideous cost to the taxpayer my hon friend mention the cost relate to infrastructure one of the huge impact that go unrecognised be the impact on road and road surface not only be many area of buckinghamshire on flood plain but our road get huge amount of use which be compound by the traffic do he agree that that be not compensate for by the fund in any way my hon friend and fellow buckinghamshire member of parliament be absolutely right day in day out we see the impact of thousand of heavy good vehicle movement have churn up our local road infrastructure these road originate as cart track and do not have deep substructure so they get churn up very easily the impact of such big infrastructure project on our road be considerable have talk about that many time in the house and have great deal of correspondence with ministers on it no matter what the infrastructure project we have to get well as country at understand the construction impact before green light be give so that they be properly mitigate it be incumbent on to fix what it break east west rail to be fair to it have do that it have resurface number of road around the claydon where it have have compound and where there have be hgv movement it be incumbent on to do the same from the outset affected community organisation have be force to negotiate their survival with ltd often at great cost to they and ultimately to the taxpayer but when town village neighbourhood or community be so brutally impact by big infrastructure argue that there be moral duty on the promoter in this case the state to mitigate compensate and treat the place and people affect fairly the rise cost of inflation since phase be approve in have mean that commitment make by the state and ltd indeed by parliament through the hybrid bill process be at risk of be delay water down or even abandon altogether that be simply unacceptable one of the most egregious example of such broken commitment be the case of st mary church in wendover this historical and much love place of worship have serve the community for century not only provide spiritual support but act as hub for local activity and event particularly music concert ltd have recognise that the noise impact from construction and in the future from pass high speed train would significantly affect the church particularly during service and the concert have mention as such it have agree to provide noise mitigation measure above all very sophisticated sound insulation yet due to rise cost and the pressure of inflation since that particular mitigation be agree in we be now be tell that these measure may not be deliver in full if at all after conversation between the church and the project begin more than eight year ago the undertaking and assurance originally give by the department for transport have not be honour through no fault of the church despite the project be contractually oblige to do so as such with inflation the original cost refer to in the will now result in less than of the work be affordable compare with what it would have cover at the time of the this be confirm after intervene to restart discussion which have effectively stall because of the fundamental unwillingness on ltd part to engage meaningfully on what be key community concern an attitude that as have raise many time in this place be evident across affected mid buckinghamshire community this be completely unacceptable commitment be make and the government must ensure that ltd honour it the congregation of st mary church should not have to suffer excessive noise pollution because of failure to manage cost effectively or the basic fact of construction inflation over so many year this be matter of fairness and upholding trust and ensure that historic institution such as st mary be protect for future generation my second example of break promise relate to wendover cricket club as say early could go much far afield in my constituency but wendover town have be particularly affect this historic local club have be an integral part of the wendover community for more than century offer young people and adult the opportunity to engage in sport stay active and participate in community life it be one of the few club across buckinghamshire that offer the wide range of age group for team that compete across the whole country it be part not just of wendover identity but of buckinghamshire identity by evict the club from its ground be drive wedge through everyone and everything there due to construction the club exist facility be render completely unusable indeed completely sever in two ltd originally pledge to provide new ground and upgrade facility to compensate for the disruption to the tune of through another of these undertaking and assurance agreement sign in however the club have now be inform that due to escalate cost the new facility may not be deliver to the standard originally agree upon or bad that they may not be deliver at all because of reluctance to pay the cost as it be in or potentially if it take that long act in good faith the cricket club have already enter into groundwork contract that include approximately worth of self fund item it be also consider pavilion contract that currently include approximately of item again self fund on the basis of receive the resource and its own reserve the state the secretary of state for transport will subject to royal assent require the nominate undertaker to contribute the sum of up to toward the reasonable cost of wendover cricket club relocate both its ellesborough road and witchell ground these delay be wholly the result of so ask the minister for an assurance that at minimum the nominate undertaker in this case ltd honour the spirit of the to wendover cricket club with an inflation adjust figure the impact of this situation on local cricket and community engagement can not be overstate wendover cricket club be volunteer organisation that be try to provide service for the local community and encourage youth and adult sport and fitness its coach teach young people discipline and teamwork and contribute to the health and wellbeing of the entire community the loss of its promise facility would be devastating blow to the area and to my constituency understand the significant economic pressure that our country face the war in ukraine supply chain disruption and other global economic factor have all contribute to rise cost however those factor must not be use as an excuse to renege on commitment that be make to community directly impact by ltd and the government must ensure that fund be allocate properly to deliver on the promise that be make to the people of wendover and beyond in my mid buckinghamshire constituency if saving in ltd need to be find and let we face it they do they should not come at the expense of community project that be explicitly agree to as mitigation measure instead we should look at where efficiency can be make in the wide project to ensure that local community be not short changed urge the minister to take the follow immediate action first will he confirm ltd commitment to deliver the promise noise mitigation measure for st mary church wendover and ensure that no backtracking take place secondly will he guarantee that wendover cricket club will receive the new ground and facility that be pledge with no reduction in quality of delivery due to cost cut measure thirdly will he ensure full transparency from ltd regard how inflationary pressure be impact community mitigation project and explore alternative funding mechanism to safeguard those commitment fourthly will he hold ltd accountable for ensure that agree mitigation measure be ringfence and be not subject to arbitrary cost save exercise that disproportionately impact community my constituent do not ask for but they have have to endure year of disruption environmental damage and upheaval in our community the very least that they deserve be for ltd to honour the commitment that it have make to mitigate the very bad excess of that impact it be matter of integrity fairness and do the right thing by the people of wendover and mid buckinghamshire look forward to the minister response and hopefully to work together to ensure that these promise be keep congratulate the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith on secure this debate on stand up so resolutely for civil society institution in his constituency and on speak so eloquently about they high inflation the pandemic protester action planning appeal judicial review and low productivity than expect have have significant impact on the cost of phase of the government have be clear that we be committed to get grip on the spiral cost as part of that work the secretary of state for transport have publish the first report to parliament under the new government set out some of the immediate action and intervention that we will take to regain control of cost and bring the project back on track for instance ministers have task the new chief executive officer of ltd mark wild with produce an action plan to reset the programme and deliver the remain work as cost effectively as possible we have also reinstate ministerial oversight of the project through ministerial taskforce to ensure transparency and accountability my department will update parliament as the important work of reset the programme and reinstating oversight progress may say on behalf of two of the buckinghamshire mps that we stand in solidarity in support for scrap altogether it be never too late for real cost save minister to scrap the whole thing well it be the former prime minister who come to manchester during the party conference to scrap from go from manchester have never know quite such political insult it be suppose to balance up our country yet we will have reduce capacity and there be an impact on northern powerhouse rail the handling of the project over number of year have have effect both on the constituency it be go through as the hon member have so passionately extoll and on those that be not get it let get back to the point that the hon member for mid buckinghamshire be here to talk about follow discussion with st mary in during the passage of the high speed rail london west midlands act the church be give an assurance and commitment that the project would support it in improve its noise insulation the assurance provide very clearly for contribution up to maximum of with no provision for inflation there be many other assurance on the public register include commitment to fund particular work or activity some of those explicitly provide for index link other do not the one give to st mary do not it be worth note that the house of lords committee set up to hear from petitioner against the bill consider the case of st mary and take the unusual step in of report that the offer be generous furthermore be pleased to report that since the assurance be give have make other improvement to its plan for noise mitigation in the locality of the church that will reduce the amount of noise reach the church in the first place take all that into account it be not consider appropriate to increase the amount of public funding offer to the church or to increase any other financial mitigation that be fix not index at the time they be agree there be no evidence that the sum be no long sufficient we have inherit difficult situation on as the hon member say and our priority now be to get grip of the cost to the government be grateful to the minister for his comment but do he accept as point of principle that that be not an arbitrary amount of money offer to the church as top up for church fund but be very specifically for noise mitigation purpose if in the money promise in simply can not deliver that it be not fair on the church or the many other project in similar position know that it be not problem of his making but it be problem that the department for transport as the sponsor body now find itself with the hon member be right have clearly already put in some noise mitigation but hope he will hear out for second understand that agreement have not yet be reach on the mitigation work to be undertake at the church as result accord to the term of the assurance the fund can not yet be release encourage the hon member and particularly the party of and the church to focus their effort on agree the work that can be carry out and timeline for they to begin so that the available funding can be release and stretch as far as humanly possible encourage the party to get together and begin that negotiation be social member of wythenshawe cricket club although my playing day be long behind so know the value that cricket club and other sport and social club provide not just in sporting term but in the social glue of cohesion and solidarity the hon member speak eloquently about wendover in his constituency the deal that be ask for have an uplift to cover inflation understand that the request be currently with which be look into the circumstance of the club and will respond in due course hope that he will get an answer very shortly if he do not he should please contact will then let the rail minister know and we will follow it up will have hear his impassione plea that this historic and successful club do not miss out the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey raise road condition be aware that ltd have be work closely with buckinghamshire council over the past few year to improve the way that such road repair be manage it have already allocate considerable resource to deal with that problem road repair be measure against the baseline road condition level agree at the start of the project either payment be make to council at current price or the repair be undertake by ltd contractor so they be not affect by inflation be pleased that the hon member for mid buckinghamshire have be far more successful with east west rail on the road repair in his constituency again congratulate the hon member on secure this debate let reiterate that transport be an essential part of the government mission to rebuild britain we will continue to work with hon member and local leader on ensure that we get the delivery of infrastructure project right as say welcome this debate as it be vital that we continue to discuss our transport project openly and transparently question put and agree to house adjourn
