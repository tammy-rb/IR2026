will try to pick out the question from the bluster on the million this be specific issue that affect september onwards where we allocate to local authority week of funding because that be the period from september to march some then say that they pay week to their provider so we have that money in order that they can provide week of funding where that be what they do on the funding rate we announce the funding rate for three and four year old in april last year and for two year old in november give that local authority have to pass on of the money that we give they provider have pretty good idea of what they will receive however while the vast majority of authority will confirm their rate in the come week small number leave it until march we be encourage they not to do that and to confirm their rate as early as possible in the same way as the other the hon lady ask how many family would not be able to access the childcare offer as result of those two issue the answer be none as she know we have increase funding rate significantly neil leitch to whom she refer be in our stakeholder group and we value his input however think it will be clear to people watch these exchange that while we get on with the big delivery of childcare ever the labour party have no plan no policy and no idea how to help family with childcare cost we set our rate by conduct survey of provider in order to understand the cost they face and set the rate accordingly last november we delay publish the rate bit in order that we could provide more money to take account of the government near increase in the national living wage we believe we be get they right in relation to what people be pay but if the hon lady have particular evidence she would like to send will happily look at it set out in my statement the additional money that we have give to the sector in the last financial year and this one to help it to meet those cost pressure that be anchor to the survey of provider that talk about again if the hon gentleman want to send information datum or specific case study will gladly have look the hon gentleman raise an important point about the increase cost pressure that everybody have to face that be why we give an additional million in the last financial year and furth million in the current financial year to help meet those pressure base on the fact that we survey provider in order to understand exactly what they be pay for all the thing he outline
