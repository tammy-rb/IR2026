pride in but the circumstance under which mike decide not to stand for re election be appal we should have be able to face each other on the basis of our idea but mike life and office be threaten by

by make her maiden speech on private member bill that she introduce this be maiden speech she say her sonorous tone echo through this hallowed place but know that the constituency of finchley would not wish to do other than come straight to the report february vol the people of finchley and golders green rightly remain as demand of their elect official today so too will come straight to the point like mrs thatcher be patriot and want our community and our country to prosper and be an influence on the global stage but unlike she fundamentally believe that there be such thing as society society be not an abstract idea to be bury in sociological essay we can see it in the rich tapestry of community that come together across finchley and golders green may be the first female jewish gibraltarian mp from this constituency but would not be here without the support of my neighbour and my community the cypriot community the somali bravanese the kosovan the japanese the irish and hindu community the lawyer and the uber driver the charity worker and the campaigner the spurs fan and the fan of some other north london team whereas in recent time some politician have choose to use north londoner as an insult my constituent and wear it as badge of pride it symbolise place that celebrate diversity hard work and look out for your neighbour our diversity come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the history of our area where else can boast the parish where archbishop desmond tutu hone his ministry in the terrible year of exile during apartheid in south africa and the

large stunt people health and potential many across finchley and golders green be struggle with the spiral cost of living this have to change not just in my constituency but across the whole country our nhs be break the prison be full the police can not respond when they be call out and our teacher be not support to deliver we need to get britain back on track and the bills set out in the king

regeneration development in europe or our brilliant high street business and local entrepreneur all we need to get grow be government who be on our side well we have that government now so to quote my famous predecessor let get straight to the point and let get on with the change that britain truly need thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to make my maiden speech in this debate it be privilege to follow the first female chancellor in history and to follow two inspire maiden speech from the labour benches by my hon friend the members for queen park and maida vale georgia gould and for finchley and golders green sarah sackman it be an honour to sit alongside they on the government benches and their community be both very lucky to have they as hon member can imagine have give careful thought to my remark today but it be safe to say that this be not the most anticipated maiden speech ever associate with welwyn hatfield the reason for that be that on november elizabeth give her inaugural address as queen from hatfield house in my constituency irrespective of how the next few minute go think her place in history be safe be especially grateful to be call in this debate on the economy my constituency be anchor by two new town that flourish under previous labour government hatfield and welwyn garden city be incorporate as new town together under single development corporation on may the growth of hatfield and welwyn garden city play an important role in the rebuilding and reimagining of life in our part of the country after the horror of the second world war believe that if we be to succeed in grow our economy we have to rediscover the ambition and the vision that be embody by those who design and carefully plan our two great town my predecessor as the mp for welwyn hatfield be the right hon grant shapps who serve our community for year and will be well known to all member of this house in fact he will probably be familiar to anyone who be watch morning television news programme at any point over the last five year before talk about grant legacy however want to start with message of reassurance to the labour whips and my colleague have no desire to hold quite so many cabinet position as he do and certainly not in such short period of time want to reflect solemnly on the personal and professional commitment that grant shapps make to the people of ukraine after the russian invasion in he open his family home to provide sanctuary to three generation of ukrainian family innocent people whose life be turn upside down by putin unprovoked act of aggression in the last parliament more than ukrainians be welcome to our country under the ukraine family scheme and the ukraine sponsorship scheme an initiative that believe show our country at its good open and welcome in an hour of grave need we serve in this house of commons at time when our wide political discourse can often be angry and divisive of course we will disagree in the house and passionately so our constituent rightly expect we always to stand up for our community and our value and will certainly try to do just that but think we can too easily forget what unite we where we agree let we have the confidence to say so my predecessor be right to champion the people of ukraine and the cause of freedom and democracy commend he for it and wish he well in whatever come

infrastructure and will be champion for it in this house welwyn hatfield be grow and increasingly diverse community in just the last few month have attend the world street food festival in welwyn

than it already be more than that the name while reference the two large town in each county ignore the other town of haslemere and liphook and the many village that range between the large population centre many argue for and support less specific but more all encompass name for the constituency such as the wey valley take its name from the beautiful river wey that run through it clearly they be not romantic in the boundary commission so farnham and bordon stick the only save grace be that its initial spell fab which sum up the area that represent this fab constituency range from farnham in the north to haslemere and liphook in the south whitehill and bordon in the west and the western village of surrey such as tilford in the east bookende by the north and south down it be an area of outstanding beauty with thrive market town pleasant village and thrive sport and art scene include the prestigious university for the creative arts it also have significant military connection most obviously in bordon which be home to the royal electrical and mechanical engineers until and be home to the longmoor range where ukrainian troop be be train military history be everywhere from

castle street in farnham the resident of this new constituency be ever thankful for the role that our armed force have play in keep we safe from arthur conan doyle to jonny wilkinson king john to flora thompson and graham thorpe to the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice hero and villain have be bear live work and play in this fabulous constituency but it be not the beautiful scenery the historic gem or the famous people who make this constituency the good in the country it be not even the fact that my grandparent run stafford sweet shop in haslemere for many year what little boy would not want grandparent who run sweet shop it be the current resident business and community spirit that make fab special and joy to represent every day there be local event charitable occasion and community festivity to get involve with indeed doubt that anywhere else in this country can rival the number of duck race in the area follow that cook tour of the constituency one might be forgive for think that there be no issue to solve home county garden of eden it of course can not be deny that there be many area of significant affluence but it should not be conceal that there be area of high deprivation and will champion their improvement the constituency location be both benefit and curse within easy commuting distance of london it provide rural haven for those who wish to live outside but work in the city that also make it rich picking for housing developer who look for any open space green or otherwise to build on be not against housing development we need home for our child and grandchild but we need the right home in the right place with the right tenure mix and with the support infrastructure conservative run east hampshire district council have do everything that it can to persuade the new government to modify their housing target to make they more appropriate for our area include write to the deputy prime minister hope that she will respond positively indeed if there be one issue that unite the whole of the new farnham and bordon constituency it be that infrastructure have not keep pace with development that be particularly acute in bordon where thousand of house be go up without the support infrastructure the gp surgery the nhs dentist the school the road and the leisure centre all need upgrade and expand rapidly to meet that housing growth we must not build more house until infrastructure catch up otherwise we will be leave with housing estate devoid of service security and society be deeply concerned about the new government plan on house building labour change to planning impose top down target and remove the right of local people to have their say on development be retrograde step that have be meet with anger from my constituent and resolute opposition from mention the need for health service in our area have spend most of my career in healthcare latterly work for seven year in the nhs improve clinical service and patient outcome know that both locally and nationally thing need to change in the nhs we need to have grow up and honest discussion with the public about how we be go to deliver provide and fund the nhs and social care go forwards for an age population with increase healthcare need and diminish birth rate that is the people who be go to pay for the nhs we need cross party discussion that bring all party together to make long term decision on how we proceed with health and social care in this country if achieve nothing else in my time here start that conversation and hopefully progress it fruitfully will be something to hope for as traditional common sense conservative believe that we can not pay for health and social care unless we have strong economy despite global pandemic war in the east of europe and instability in the middle east and regardless of the picture that the government be try to paint in their press release the most recent statistic show that the economy be turn around and be on an upward trajectory will oppose any measure by this government include the misguided nationalisation of industry and the socialist labour rule that believe will hamper or reverse that trend equally important be to safeguard ourselves from external threat the rise of resurgent russia china and north korea be something that we should all be concern about do not believe that it be hyperbole to say that we be in pre war era and we need to ensure that our border sky and infrastructure both physical and digital be safe from threat that be why absolutely believe that we should move to of gdp spend on defence immediately and increase that to when practical in short we must protect our economy healthcare and national security to ensure the prosperity and safety of our country but mindful that maiden speech be not mean to be controversial shall leave it there and return briefly to the subject of my fab constituency in samuel pepys record that the people of liphook be good honest people give his own moral and motivation be not sure whether he mean that as compliment but assure the house that it be as true now as it be then for the resident of farnham bordon haslemere

minister sir john major who be still hold in the high regard across the constituency it be an honour to receive his endorsement during the recent election campaign famously it be also the former seat of the lord protector oliver cromwell cromwell be the member of parliament for huntingdon in for just over year until charles dissolve parliament records show that he make just one speech in that time so far so equal it be clear that huntingdon expect certain level of stature from its member of parliament notable as sir john major and oliver cromwell surely be arguably they be not huntingdon most famous product it be not even the celebrated diarist samuel pepys who attend huntingdon grammar school in fact that accolade should be award to lunch time staple that everyone be familiar with one that everyone have favourite version of and one that some member may well have have for lunch this very day john montagu three time first lord of the admiralty postmaster general and secretary of

air force bombardment group on july the us eighth air force fly the first american mission over nazi occupy europe from raf molesworth latterly during the cold war raf alconbury see the us air force

of that base be now huntingdon new housing estate alconbury weald surely the only housing development in the country with fully functional nuclear decontamination and washdown facility raf warboys raf upwood and raf brampton have all since disappear but the constituency still retain those link raf alconbury and raf molesworth be still operate by the united states air force and raf wyton be on the

government will look closely at how support itself be provide restructure veterans uk and create more comprehensive holistic offering ease access via an overhauled veteran gateway could streamline access to the welfare service that our veteran need while the cohort of veteran in this house be small than in the previous parliament it be now young and sport member on both side who have more recent operational experience and crucially more recent experience of the often difficult post military transition to civilian life parliament be well place to champion veteran welfare and give the

significantly outperform other part of the united kingdom furthermore be encourage to note that median monthly wage growth in northern ireland be outpace that in other part of the united kingdom position we fifth among the uk region it be imperative that we build on this economic success and translate it into improved quality of life and regeneration in north down we must also be mindful of the fact that most of northern ireland trade be across the vital east west axis with great britain alongside the important albeit less north south corridor with the republic of ireland accord to the northern ireland statistics and research agency sale and export along the east west corridor between great britain and northern ireland be value at billion in in comparison sale and export between northern ireland and the republic of ireland total just billion this highlight why the union of great britain and northern ireland be invaluable and should be cherish as it enhance economic quality of

and supply chain furthermore it have cause political and social tension in northern ireland raise legitimate concern among unionists about their place in the united kingdom contend that by prioritise the eu regulatory framework over the wish of the people of northern ireland to be full part of the uk the protocol disregard democratic principle and subject we to foreign law it need to be change it
