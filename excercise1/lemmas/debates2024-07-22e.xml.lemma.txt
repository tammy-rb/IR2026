challenge such as climate change our voice belong in the room centre stage fight for the national interest my conversation have focus on issue on which the british people want action so would like to update the house on my discussion in three specific area the first be european security in washington tell nato ally that the generational threat from russia demand generational response that be why my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer will set out clear path to spend of our gdp on defence it be also why launch strategic defence review lead by the former nato secretary general lord robertson to strengthen our armed force and keep our nation safe also take the opportunity at the nato summit to confirm that we will deliver billion worth of military aid to ukraine each year for as long as it take and together we confirm ukraine irreversible path to full nato membership because it be clear to that nato will be strong with ukraine as member something reiterate to president zelensky in person in downing street on friday secondly want to turn to the middle east because that region be at moment of grave danger and fragility have speak to leader in the region and ally around the world about our collective response how can we deal with the malign influence of iran address its nuclear programme manage the threat from the houthis ease tension on israel northern border and work with all partner to uphold regional security fundamental to that of course be the conflict in gaza have speak to the leader of israel and the palestinian authority have be clear that fully support israel right to security and the desperate need to see the hostage return have also be clear that the situation in gaza be intolerable and that the world will not look away as innocent civilian include woman and child continue to face death disease and displacement mr speaker it can not go on we need an immediate ceasefire hostage out aid in huge scale up of humanitarian assistance that be the policy of this government and an immediate ceasefire be the only way to achieve it so we will do all we can in pursuit of these goal that be why as one of the first action take by this government we have restart british funding to the un relief and works agency to deliver that crucial humanitarian support we receive the international court of justice opinion on friday and will consider it carefully before respond but let say that we have always be oppose to the expansion of illegal settlement and we call on all side to recommit to stability peace normalisation and the two state solution recognise palestinian state the right of the palestinian people alongside safe and secure israel thirdly want to turn to illegal migration this issue have now become crisis and in order to tackle it we must reach out hand to our european friend we start that work at the epc agree new arrangement with slovenia and slovakia deepen co operation across europe for our new border security command and increase the uk presence at europol in the hague to play our full part in the european migrant smuggling centre the crisis we face be the fault of gang no question but to stop illegal migration we must also recognise the root cause conflict climate change and extreme poverty so have announce million of new funding for project across africa and the middle east to provide humanitarian and health support skill training and access to education because the decision that people take to leave their home can not be separate from these wide issue we will work with our partner to stamp out this vile trade wherever it exist and focus on the hard yard of law enforcement with solution that will actually deliver result have see that in action tackle counter terrorism as director of public prosecutions and we can do the same on illegal migration but let be clear there be no need to withdraw from the european convention on human right that be not consistent with the value of that blood bond so we will not withdraw not now not ever the basic fact be that the priority of the british people do require we to work across border with our partner and government of service at home require government of strength abroad that be our role it have always be our role britain belong on the world stage commend this statement to the house call the leader of the opposition thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement and join he in praise president biden for his long career of public service both at home and abroad work together we take our aukus partnership to the next level support israel after the terrible event of october defend our country from the houthi threat and lead global effort to support ukraine as it resist russia assault on personal level it be pleasure to work with he to strengthen the partnership between our two country and wish he well as the prime minister indicate the world be increasingly uncertain the most dangerous it have be since the end of the cold war russia continue its illegal and brutal invasion of ukraine iran continue with its regionally destabilising behaviour both iran and north korea be supply russian force in ukraine as we speak and china be adopt more aggressive stance in the south china sea and the taiwan strait together that axis of authoritarian state be increasingly work together to undermine democracy and reshape the world order in those circumstance our alliance take on ever great importance commend the prime minister on his work with our close ally at both the nato summit in washington and the european political community meeting at blenheim across this house we build strong consensus on foreign policy in the last parliament which have stand our country in good stead in this transition our ally particularly ukraine know that although our government have change britain remain an active involved and reliable partner be glad that the prime minister also share our view of the value of the epc community as forum be pleased by and welcome the fact that he use the summit to discuss illegal migration because it be one of the most pressing problem face our entire continent when it come to illegal migration we all face the same fundamental question how to deal with people who come to our country illegally while respect our international obligation of course it be not feasible or right to return afghans to the taliban syrians to assad or iranians to the ayatollah but nor can our country accommodate everyone who would like to leave afghanistan syria or iran and come here be pleased to hear the prime minister say that he be pragmatist and that he would look at what work when it come to square that circle urge he in his conversation with other european leader to keep the option of further third country migration partnership on the table as other country have be discuss know the prime minister be also interested in pursue security and defence co operation pact with the european union and here just urge he to be alert to the off involve hope he can reassure the house that any close co operation with the eu will not adversely affect the technological and procurement aspect of our other alliance such as aukus of course we be pillar of european security as our leadership on ukraine have show but we also have alliance and interest that extend beyond the european continent turn to the nato summit it be good to see the alliance reaffirm its commitment to ukraine with the uk at the heart of that leadership hope the prime minister will keep the house update on how the new unit to co ordinate our collective support to ukraine will indeed lead to an increase in vital support urge the prime minister to continue stress to our ally that now be the moment to increase not to pare down our backing for ukraine as the uk have continue to lead in do in the year of its existence nato have establish itself as the most successful defensive alliance in history the good way to strengthen the alliance be for its non american member to do more to show that we do not expect the americans to bear every burden and welcome the prime minister indication that the chancellor will soon set out clear path to invest of gdp in our armed force hope by that would both show the americans that the other member of the alliance be serious about boost our own capability and show president putin and our adversary that we be serious about defend our border and ally from russian or any other aggression the prime minister also speak about the situation in the middle east we all want to see progress towards two state solution where israelis and palestinians can live side by side in peace prosperity and security however as we make progress towards that goal our friend and ally israel must have the right to defend itself against the threat that it be face threat demonstrate by the drone strike on tel aviv at the end of last week by the iranian align houthi rebel in conclusion thank the prime minister for come to update the house today can assure he that we on the opposition benches will work with he on these question of foreign policy and national security we will ask question probe and push for answer that be our duty as the official opposition but we will always act in the national interest and work constructively with he to ensure the security of our country thank the leader of the opposition for his welcome comment in relation to president biden which be sure will be well receive and for what he say about the consensus on foreign policy in relation to nato and the epc that be important and be glad that we have manage to get that consensus over recent year because we be in more volatile world and the world be look in to see unity in the united kingdom particularly in relation to ukraine have commend the role of the previous government in relation to ukraine and do so again take the deliberate decision when be leader of the opposition not to depart on ukraine because take and continue to take the view that the only winner in that circumstance be putin who want to see division it be very important for ukraine to see that continue unity across this house we will of course work with other in relation to the point make by the prime old habit die hard on the point make by the leader of the opposition about security and co operation with our eu ally do believe that be to our mutual benefit but can assure he and the house that it do not cut across or come at the cost of other alliance we be fully commit to aukus as make clear in opposition and take this early opportunity to affirm it in government because it be an area on which there be an important consistency across the house in relation to the conflict in gaza the more that we in this house can be unite the well it be an issue of great complexity but the approach that have be show be the right one and we take it forward in that spirit congratulate the prime minister on his fly start on the world stage and on his determination to build not simply rule base order but right base order root in what churchill call the great charter and we call the european convention on human right we want its freedom and liberty to be enjoy by the people of ukraine but that will take victory over russia it will need more than courage it will need resource do he discuss with international colleague the need not simply to freeze russian asset but to seize and put they to work in defeat once and for all the tyranny of president putin thank my right hon friend for that question on the centrality of the ukraine issue yes of course that require resource and more pressure in relation to sanction but it also require resolve key issue come out of the nato council in washington be the real sense particularly in relation to ukraine of big nato with more country than ever at the council strong nato and unity of resolve in stand up to russian aggression particularly in ukraine resource and sanction be central to the agenda there call the leader of the liberal democrats thank the prime minister for advance sight of the statement close co operation with our european neighbour be absolutely essential whether on russia illegal war against ukraine or on tackle the criminal gang responsible for the small boat crisis and welcome the new government change in approach also welcome their support for an immediate ceasefire in gaza clearly we need to put an end to the humanitarian devastation there get the hostage home and open the door to two state solution uphold international law be also crucial to that end hope the government will respect last week ruling of the icj when they consider it on the nato summit year on from the foundation of nato the alliance have never be more relevant we support the nato summit pledge of long term security assistance for ukraine as well as increase support now to ensure she can resist russia attack and liberate her territory be pleased that in this new parliament this house will continue to stand unite behind the brave ukrainians oppose russia illegal war just as we have do together in recent year however hope member of this house will not be complacent about the impact that the upcoming us election could have not just on the security of the uk and our ally but on the security of ukraine we must hope that the leadership of president biden continue with his successor echo the prime minister tribute to president biden but whatever happen in the us part of the answer be for the uk and europe to increase defence spending the previous conservative government have leave legacy of the small army since the age of napoleon and play fast and loose with public money make our share ambition to spend of gdp on defence much more complicated route we look forward to the chancellor of the exchequer plan hope this government will start by reverse the plan cut to the army of troop that be vital first step so will the prime minister reassure the house and the country that it will be priority within the recently launch strategic defence review we also urge the government to move far and fast in take step to seize frozen russian asset of which there be billion worth on our shore and the same amount on the continent hope the prime minister recognise that we have an opportunity to lead within europe on this vital issue if the us can not europe must thank the right hon gentleman for raise those three issue on the international court we respect the independence of the court and international law let be very clear about that will not get tempt by question about the us election later this year save to say that it will obviously be for the american people to decide who they want as their president and as member would expect we will work with whoever be the president after they have make their choice take the right hon gentleman point about the low number of troop which will be look at in the strategic defence review that we be carry out into threat capability and resource it be incredibly pleasing to see the prime minister both at nato and welcome leader from across our continent to blenheim palace at historic moment for reset with europe after the disastrous legacy that the depart government leave behind do the subject of youth mobility for student and suchlike arise and could his government look into repair it for its soft power cultural exchange and growth boost property that have be so value as we be now in post erasmus era thank my hon friend for her question the reset with our european ally be well receive and there be clearly an appetite to work in different and well way with the uk which think will stand we in good stead as we go forward we do have discussion about close relationship with our eu ally but make it very clear from the outset as have do in opposition that that do not mean rejoin the eu it do not mean go back into the structure of the eu and it do not mean freedom of movement take the early opportunity to make that clear to our european ally so that we can move forward progressively but with the right framework in mind may congratulate the prime minister on his election victory and particularly on the very strong commitment he give at the beginning of his campaign to the maintenance of the strategic trident nuclear deterrent in the future do he agree that if there have exist in or in an organisation like nato that commit america to the protection from day one of country such as belgium in the one case or poland in the other those two terrible conflict might well never have break out do he therefore share my concern that the virus of isolationism be again on the move in certain part of the american political spectrum thank the right hon member for that question first be able to make clear our unshakeable commitment to the nuclear deterrent something do in opposition have be able to make that absolutely clear as prime minister and it be very important that do so from the outset in relation to what may have happen in the past will not speculate but believe that nato be the most successful alliance the world have ever know and that it be as need now as it be when it be found the then labour government be very proud to be founder member of nato and it be very important for to reaffirm our unshakeable support for nato the world be more volatile place the challenge be great now than they have be for many year and think that nato be as need now and as relevant now as it have ever be in its history congratulate my right hon friend the prime minister on the leadership he show not just at nato but at the european political community work together and collaborate be important not least in the unstable world that we be in could he set out what discussion he have about the eu uk trade and co operation agreement in the light of its renegotiation deadline next year be able to have early discussion about the eu uk trade arrangement of preliminary sort there be an appetite for that discussion no one pretend that it be an easy discussion and be pleased to have appoint minister the paymaster general and minister for the cabinet office who will take responsibility for that important work it do not involve rejoin the eu it do involve reset and improve the relationship we have with our eu ally can first congratulate the prime minister on his election win and wish he the very good in his new role build on the last question the epc summit seem very positive how do he see use this political locus to get the uk in the good possible position for the renegotiation of the tca in thank the right hon member for his comment there be an appetite now for different discussion about our future relation with the eu whether that be trade education and research or security co operation particularly in the light of what have happen in ukraine there be shared sense that there be room for close work and close tie there they be the three main area it be at the very early stage but the reset be well receive by many european ally and be pleased to have that early opportunity to set out our case the prime minister statement will be warmly welcome by the people of rochdale particularly the ukrainian community which have flourish in our town for nearly year so can pass on to he direct message from olga kurtianyk who be the chair of the rochdale branch of the association of ukrainians in great britain who tell yesterday that she be very grateful for the prime minister continue support for president zelensky in the fight against the illegal war that putin have wag be very pleased to hear that and to be able to make that clear commitment but want to emphasise that this be the continuation of the work of the previous government which we fully support before and fully support now what be also important for our community and certainly important for the international community be to see the unity that we have be able to maintain here in this chamber the world watch in relation to our unity and it be important therefore that we maintain it as we go forward may also add my personal congratulation to the prime minister on his election win the international rule base system be the cornerstone of peace and security the prime minister talk of ceasefire in gaza and the application of the rule of law what measure be he willing to take to make sure that be implement furthermore be outside the eu make we less safe the populist who want we to turn away from the eu and towards trump style isolationism be play straight into putin hand so what be we do to get close to the eu in relation to ceasefire obviously talk be under way at quite an advanced stage and we have already urge all side in the international discussion that have have to move forward on ceasefire because without ceasefire it be very difficult to envisage the circumstance in which further hostage can come out safely and aid can go in at the scale that be desperately need also ceasefire can be foot in the door for the beginning of process however remote it may seem at the moment to two state solution in relation to the eu we have share interest in safety and security with our eu ally and that be very much the topic of discussion we have at the epc summit last week for my constituent in makerfield restore control over our border be key issue of concern it have become matter of public trust do the prime minister agree that the new border security command be an opportunity to show how the uk can play lead role in tackle criminal smuggler gang yes do and the command be base on the work do as director of public prosecutions work with law enforcement and security and intelligence sharing with our ally in the case be work on to deal with counter terrorism have never accept the argument that the only gang that apparently can not be take down use the same technique be the gang run this vile trade there be real interest in what we be say at the epc summit last week and an understanding that if we share intelligence datum strategy and approach we can all do more to bring down these vile gang welcome the prime minister reiteration that the uk remain the strong supporter of ukraine against russian aggression but what support can we also give to another former soviet state armenia both in resolve its conflict with azerbaijan and in pursue its ambition to move close to nato and the european union in the face of russian threat and intimidation be grateful for that question this come up in the discussion last thursday as would have be expect with joint resolve to provide the support and framework need for peace and security across the entire region again there be share intent with our ally to work together on this because it be of such importance thank the right hon gentleman for raise it be one of newly elect member on this side of the house who have serve in the armed force and in plymouth so many of my friend and neighbour have serve as well all of we be deeply concerned by the ongoing illegal invasion and inhumane increasingly barbaric tactic russia be use will the prime minister agree with that in an uncertain world one thing we can be sure of be that ukraine have no firm friend than the uk yes can confirm that and emphasise just how important it be we have the honour of host president zelensky at downing street on friday where be able to make that clear and again to take the opportunity to say that we be build on the work of the previous government not depart from that work think the support of the uk in particular to ukraine have be lead important and provide at difficult time which have often lead to other move in accordance with the move we have make as country president zelensky be grateful for the role we have play in the past and that we continue to play now my constituent in sleaford and north hykeham be very concerned about level of illegal migration particularly people cross the channel be pleased to hear the prime minister say that he want to tackle it he mention two measure million to tackle root cause and the focus which be arguably already present from law enforcement in the last seven day people cross the channel how many of they would he expect to have be deter by the measure he describe this be real problem that we have inherit because not enough attention have be pay to border control in my view record number have come this year the measure take by the last government be patently not work so we need to address that that be why we have take early step to set up the border security command it be also why we have already move more staff into the return unit so it can get on with the job of actually return those who have no right to be here one hundred staff have move already in the early day of this government but we have to recognise that we also need to address the reason that people move in the first place which be very much to do with conflict poverty and climate change if we ignore those upstream cause we will never fully get to grip with the problem that be so obvious to so many people in this country thank the prime minister for his statement and thank he particularly for his commitment to reset our relationship with the european union it be regrettable that the deal sign by the opposition when they be in government do real damage to our economy it put up barrier to trade with the european union and increase red tape do the prime minister agree that now be the time for new relationship and to take practical measure such as the mutual recognition of professional qualification to increase our alignment with the european union so we can help our service and get our economy move again do not think the deal we have be good enough if we talk to any business that deal with the eu they complain it be not good enough for they and have make trade hard not easy and that be real problem we can do well than that the epc be an early opportunity for we to reset our relationship and begin progress towards that well relationship whether that be in relation to trade or defence and security which be both very important to we welcome that the prime minister say that there be an appetite for reset in our relationship with our european neighbour core element of collective european security be collective economic security he know that be outside the single market and the custom union have cost the uk economy almost billion how will he remedy this toxic tory legacy by continue to refuse even to consider rejoin those economic structure think the relationship can improve we can have well relationship but do not think we can simply ignore the referendum and go back into the eu in the discussion have with our european ally none of they be urge we to take that course they be interested in the argument we be make about well relationship and how that could work in relation to trade education and security and defence that be why want to be clear from the outset about our approach the hexham constituency as the prime minister will know be home to the otterburn range which have play key role in train our armed force for decade what step will the prime minister take to improve the work relationship between our armed force and those of our nato ally our armed force provide huge resource to nato particularly in europe and across our armed force we be fully commit in almost every respect to nato there be huge room for further such work build on what be clearly work already the prime minister have give we fine word about the importance of our membership of international institution particularly international court and agree with he it be profoundly in our national interest that we be member of these organisation but he will know as well as that those court be only as good as the action and consequence that flow from their judgment without action and consequence their judgment just become hot air in relation to israel gaza and in particular the occupation of the west bank can he please assure we that he be consider hard consequence for the very obvious flagrant breach of international law that be take place daily in that part of the world be grateful for that question because believe in international law and think it be very important that we keep to our commitment on international law we be know for that as nation and it matter to the world in relation to the court respect their independence obviously we will have robust discussion about particular action judgment that they might publish and decision that they come to but for those who believe in international law it be important to be equally clear that we support the independence of the court without that anchor we do not have the framework that be so important to we in term of enforce international law welcome the prime minister statement and very much echo his word about president biden do the prime minister agree with and the people of newcastle under lyme that the only way to stop illegal migration and the subsequent tragic loss of life be by our united kingdom work more closely with our european neighbour to smash the gang who run this vile trade yes do we have already be able to put further resource into europol last thursday we have very live discussion about share datum and intelligence and about an overarching strategy on prosecution with our european ally who be keen to learn more about what we be propose and how they could play their part with we to smash the gang because the gang operate across border that can be do only in conjunction and collaboration with our eu partner the last government spend quite some time engage with isolationist in washington they seek to influence conservative think tank in the us that be listen to by republicans such as the heritage foundation appreciate the prime minister point that it be for the american people to decide who govern they later this year but what more can his government do to stress to republicans and to candidate trump that european and american security be indivisible on the first part of the question luckily do not answer for the last government answer for this government we will work with whoever the american people elect as president but specifically on the question the special relationship between the uk and the us be forge in the most difficult of circumstance and have endure for many year and it be important both to the us and to the uk to maintain that special relationship have have an early opportunity to make my position clear on this again it be continuation of the position of the last government that special relationship matter to we whoever end up be the president of america do the prime minister agree that we need nato first defence policy in the face of grow russian aggression as see in ukraine will he join in pay tribute to the doncaster ukrainian centre in my constituency which have work tirelessly around the clock to support ukrainian refugee demonstrate the true community spirit of doncaster let start by join in that and make it clear that this work do in so many community be really important in term of the support give and the welcome show to refugee the point about nato first be important as say we be proud to have be among the found member of nato and the review that we have put in place have framework principle one of which be nato first that will inform the way in which we conduct the strategic review why do we continue to limit ukraine ability to take the fight to russia the approach to capability take by the uk remain the same as it be three week ago no different decision have be take and be base on the principle of recognise ukraine right to self defence and the parameter of international law think that be right and that be why no new decision have be take do the prime minister agree that the strength and unity of purpose express by our international alliance be mirror and enhance by the solidarity and friendship that the british people have show by accommodate ukrainians in this country would he join in praise the work of the rugby ukrainian community and assure that his government will continue to support such group yes on both point number of month ago in swindon be strike by the incredible contribution of ukrainian woman who be lead workshop on business and success on the main point about the attitude of british people it be good to be able to say to president zelensky that we have just have an election and we have be all over the united kingdom and pretty much wherever we go we see the ukrainian flag and people support ukraine irrespective of party political difference there be real sense that the whole country as well as the government and the opposition support ukraine and be determined to do whatever they can to stand up to russian aggression we should be proud of the fact that we see that right across the country congratulate the prime minister on the office that he have achieve and thank he for his statement be pleased with the decision to remain part of the european convention on human right in all his meeting with both the eu and nato be the issue of global war consider not just the war in ukraine and palestine but those in sudan congo and yemen and the possibility of involve the un much more in look towards more peaceful future rather than continue great expenditure on arm be pleased that the prime minister have call for ceasefire in gaza but surely if we be to follow international law we need to go bit far and call for the withdrawal of israeli occupy force both from gaza and the west bank and an end to our complicity by supply arm to israel order may say gently to the right hon gentleman that have lot more to get in today and as important as his message be need to make other hear let deal with both point first conflict resolution do come up because we have full discussion about illegal migration the law enforcement aspect of it as have explain and the root cause of migration conflict poverty and climate change be key among they the prospect of ceasefire be there be urge all party to take that opportunity it be an important foot in the door for the political process which believe be the only process that will bring about last peace and resolution in the middle east congratulate the prime minister on very successful set of meeting last week do he agree that the shift relationship with the european union lead by the previous government have make we economically poor and undermine small business such as the toy shop in horsforth in my constituency which close will he ensure that small business and their need and prosperity will be at the heart of any renegotiation deal in two year time business across the country that deal with europe feel that the deal that the last government negotiate be not good enough for they and have make trading much hard that be why they be encourage we to reset that relationship and get well deal well for our country our business and our economy our no mission in government be to grow our economy so it be very important to see this in that context too congratulate the prime minister on what be obviously successful series of meeting last week he have set out some of his new policy to deal with illegal migration across the channel and to return illegal migrant from this country in what sort of timescale could the british people reasonably expect his new policy to start have real effect we have take early measure because the british people want to see an impact and difference they feel very much that in recent year there have be loss of control of the border that be matter of border security and actually national security that be why we have act quickly to begin the step to set up the border security command it be why we have already begin to put more staff in the return unit and take decision on the upstream work need to reduce the likelihood of migration in the first place they be early step and be not go to put an arbitrary date on that but do understand the thrust of the question this be an area of great importance where british people want to see material change in the situation in gateshead central and whickham and across the north east those who have flee putin war in ukraine want to make the most of their time in our community but above all they want to know that the british people stand with they so thank the prime minister for his ongoing support for the people of ukraine but can he expand far on ukraine future entry into nato which be so critically important yes can and be grateful for the opportunity to do so the north atlantic council commit itself to an irreversible path to membership of nato that be material step forward from year ago and be among the reason president zelensky say that the council be success in relation to membership of nato that be why say what say in my statement that path be now irreversible and that be good thing welcome across the nato ally the level of infiltration by hamas of the united nations relief and works agency be well document from unrwa staff take part in the pure evil that be the october attack to unrwa fund school be use to store weapon and harbour terrorist and to terror infrastructure be find under unrwa headquarters in gaza city before the prime minister take the decision to re commit uk taxpayer money to unrwa what advice do he receive on that infiltration and what step have he demand be take so that uk taxpayer money can never be use to fund terror or preach hate as the hon member would expect we take the most careful advice and subject it to the most careful consideration because we be concern as anyone in this house would be by the suggestion and allegation in relation to october we look at that really carefully take it very seriously and give it the utmost consideration there have of course be an independent review and step put in place but there be vital role for unrwa many other country have restore funding for unrwa it be the right thing to do but can give an assurance that the most careful consideration be give before that step be take as the hon member would expect warmly welcome the announcement that the uk will lead an initiative to crack down on russia shadow fleet of sanction evade ship which be help to generate dirty money to fund russia war machine will the prime minister continue to make sanction enforcement priority and update the house on the state of international negotiation on use frozen russian asset include those in kensington and bayswater to support ukraine now be grateful for that question important progress be make at nato on sanction and it be important for the house to have regular update so we can commit to give the next update as soon as it be appropriate to do so think across the house there be resolve to use sanction as effectively as they can be use as one of the weapon in relation to russian aggression hope the prime minister enjoy welcome fellow european leader to blenheim palace in my constituency one of my constituent rose be study spanish and french at southampton university she would like to spend her year abroad work in spain to strengthen her language skill and improve her employment prospect yet as it stand she have no right to work there hope the prime minister see the benefit of work with his european counterpart and perhaps make few new friend hear his response on not rejoin the political structure but as specific measure to improve opportunity for young people will he open talk with the european union on youth mobility scheme it be very good to be in the hon member constituency at blenheim palace can not tell he how many european leader say to that they have previously visit usually while they be study in the uk but have only pay the to get into the ground because they have not have the money to get into the building that they be then enter that be common theme as for the substance of the hon gentleman question we be not return to freedom of movement understand the desire of people to work in other country but need to make it clear that there be no rejoin the european union no rejoin the single market or the custom union and no return to freedom of movement however do believe there be well deal that we can work on and think that the more we can work across the house on that the well because then it will be the more enduring as the proud home of the royal military academy sandhurst my constituency know the vital importance of our armed force in keep britain safe so warmly welcome the government commitment to set out path towards spend of gdp on defence can the prime minister update the house on conversation that he have have with our nato friend and ally to encourage other to match that target be proud of the commitment that we already make to nato on as would be expect we do have discussion at the nato council on the need for all nato member to make that contribution and to increase their contribution and there be commitment to do so our commitment to will be set out and the path will be set out by the chancellor at future fiscal event can the prime minister confirm that in seek to reset britain relationship with the european union his government will not accept the automatic application of eu rule in britain unless they have be specifically agree by this parliament yes thank the prime minister for the leadership that he have show in his discussion at blenheim especially those on nato be proud to hear he recommit we to two state solution in the middle east and to an immediate ceasefire in gaza do he agree that this conflict be dire but urgently need sober and considerate solution rather than extreme rhetoric from those who might seek to sow further division yes do and be grateful for that question because there be the prospect of ceasefire it be desperately need for the reason that we have already discuss but it will only happen if there be international agreement and sober assessment that provide the framework for the release of the remain hostage shudder to think of the state of some of they for the aid that be desperately need to be allow in at the scale that be need and for the beginning of the process in my view the only process that will lead to last resolution of this awful conflict it be not just in all our interest but our duty to do everything we can to ensure that that come about border security and asylum order before call the home secretary may just say this to she the statement do not arrive in my office in time it be late and believe that it be also late for the opposition quite rightly the home secretary make big thing of this when she be the shadow home secretary so remind she of her own word statement do need to arrive on time this be the second time so far and know it will not happen again because what have say will be take on board may thank you mr speaker for stand up for the opposition front benchers as know you have often do for in the past apologise to the shadow home secretary for the delay in the arrival of the statement most people in the united kingdom want to see strong border security with properly control and manage asylum system where our country do its bit alongside other to help those who have flee persecution but where rule be properly respect and enforce so that those with no right to be here be swiftly remove at the moment we have none of those thing border security be be undermine by criminal smuggler gang and the asylum system be in chaos tragically life have be lose in the channel so far this year include child no one should be make these perilous small boat journey criminal gang have be allow to take hold along our border and they be make huge profit from undermine our border security and put life at risk they should not be able to get away with it crossing in the first half of be up by on last year the number be go up instead of come down at the same time the asylum backlog be get bad as decision making in the home office have drop home office spending on asylum support have increase sevenfold in the space of just three year this can not go on since my appointment two week ago have review the policy programme and legislation that we have inherit from our predecessor and have be shock by what have find not only be there already serious problem on current policy the chaos and cost be likely to get bad on our border security it be clear that the security and enforcement arrangement we have inherit be too weak criminal gang network be operate with impunity along our border across the continent and beyond and across the uk too action between britain and france in the channel have improve and be prevent some boat crossing the work of the small boat operational command in the channel be important and will continue but we need to go much far we should be take far more action upstream long before the boat ever reach the french coast co operation with europol and other european police force and prosecutor be far too limited and enforcement against exploitation and traffic in the uk be far too weak information share with our european neighbour have reduce rather than increase as result of these weak arrangement be extremely concerned that the high level of dangerous crossing that we have inherit be likely to persist throughout the summer let turn to the rwanda migration and economic development partnership two and half year after the previous government launch it can report that it have already cost the british taxpayer million in order to send just four volunteer that include million on payment to rwanda and the cost of charter flight that never take off detain hundred of people and then release they and pay for more than civil servant to work on the scheme for scheme to send four people it be the most shocking waste of taxpayer money have ever see look forward the cost be set to get bad even if the scheme have ever get go it be clear that it would have cover only minority of arrival yet substantial portion of future cost be fix cost for example the annual direct payment to rwanda the contract for escort the staffing in the home office the detention and reception centre and more the taxpayer would have still have to pay out no matter how few people be relocate most shockingly of all over the six year of the migration and economic development partnership forecast the previous government have plan to spend over billion of taxpayer money on the scheme they do not tell parliament that thank the rwandan government for work with the uk in good faith because the failure of this policy lie with the previous uk government it have be costly con and the taxpayer have have to pay the price turn to the illegal migration act which have be in place for year we be tell that it would stop the boat but it have clearly fail the legal contradiction in the act be so great that they make it unworkable indeed month on the central duty have not even be enact it be also cost the taxpayer billion of pound under section of the act people who arrive in the uk can claim asylum and get asylum accommodation however under section if they arrive after march and meet key condition in the act no decision can be take on their case they just stay in the asylum system even if they have come here unlawfully for economic reason and should be return to their home country they will not be because the law do not work only small minority might ever have be send to rwanda everyone else stay indefinitely in taxpayer fund accommodation and support the home office estimate that around of asylum case since march should be cover by those illegal migration act condition the remain under the previous government policy should still have be process and clear in the normal way however even though previous ministers introduce this new law month ago they do not ever introduce an effective operational way for the home office to distinguish between the case cover by the illegal migration act and the other case where decision should continue that is between the and the as result decision can not be take on any of they have be shock to discover that the home office have effectively stop make the majority of asylum decision thousand of asylum caseworker can not do their proper job as result the backlog of asylum case be now go up this be the most extraordinary policy have ever see we have inherit asylum hotel arrive in the asylum system and they never leave the previous government policy be effectively an amnesty and that be the wrong thing to do it be not just bad policy it be also completely unaffordable the cost of this indefinitely rise asylum backlog in hotel and accommodation support bill be astronomical the potential cost of asylum support over the next four year if we continue down this track could be an eye water billion to billion that be double the annual police budget for england and wales this newly elect government be not prepared to let this chaos continue so let turn to the action we be urgently take to restore some grip to the system to tackle the chaos and to get cost down first have inform the rwandan government that we will be end the migration and economic development partnership we will save million on further direct payment to rwanda over the next few year and we will immediately save up to million that have be put aside by the previous government to cover the medp this year secondly we will invest some of the save money from the migration partnership into new border security command instead it will bring together the work of the border force the national crime agency the small boat operational command and intelligence and security officer the recruitment have begin for new commander and we will put in place additional cross border officer investigator prosecutor and intelligence and security officer with the new counter terror style power against organised immigration crime announce in the king speech last week we be immediately increase uk officer involvement in europol and the european migrant smuggling centre thirdly we will replace the rwanda migration partnership with serious return and enforcement programme we have immediately replace the flight planning for rwanda with actual flight to return people who have no right to stay to their home country instead we be immediately redeploy home office staff away from the fail rwanda partnership and into return and enforcement to reverse the collapse in removal that have take place since have task the immigration enforcement team with intensify enforcement activity this summer target illegal work across high risk sector fourthly we will end the asylum chaos and start take asylum decision again so that we can clear the backlog and end asylum hotel the new border security asylum and immigration bill announce in the king speech will bring in new replacement arrangement include fast track decision and return to safe country in the meantime be lay statutory instrument that end the retrospective nature of the illegal migration act provision so that the home office can immediately start clear case from after march make this one simple change will save the taxpayer an estimate billion over the next year fifthly as the prime minister have just set out we will work closely with our european neighbour to tackle the upstream cause of migration include through the rome process this country will always do our bit alongside other to help those flee war and persecution but we need proper system where rule be enforce there be no quick fix to the chaos create over the last year it will take time to clear the asylum backlog to bring cost down and to get new enforcement in place to strengthen our border and prevent dangerous boat crossing but there be no alternative to serious hard graft we can not waste any more time or money on gimmick the country vote for change and that mean it be time for sensible serious plan commend this statement to the house this very important statement overrun slightly so be more than happy for the opposition spokesperson also to run over if need be call the shadow home secretary thank you very much mr speaker welcome you back to your place on my first opportunity to do so in my time as home secretary and before that foreign secretary you be very kind about my minor indiscretion at the dispatch box my late deployment of statement and my slight overrun you have always be very kind to my family in sometimes quite try circumstance which very much appreciate also take this opportunity to congratulate the right hon member for pontefract castleford and knottingley yvette cooper on her appointment as home secretary it be challenging but incredibly rewarding job and because the nation security be now very much in she and her ministers hand genuinely wish she all success in everything she be look to do the right hon lady inherit dedicated team of home office civil servant who will help she to keep the country safe and secure they help when be in her position and although it be disorderly to recognise their presence if be to wave my hand vaguely in their direction might take the opportunity to thank my previous private office civil servant my note say that want to thank the home secretary and her team for advance sight of her statement but will put line through that the labour party and indeed the home secretary like to talk tough on border security but today statement despite all the hyperbole and the make up number be basically an admission of what we know all along which be that the labour party have scrap the rwanda partnership on ideological ground remove deterrent that the national crime agency say we need the level of discourtesy direct towards the people and government of rwanda be quite breathtaking to have they read about this decision in the paper before anyone from the uk government have the good grace to formally notify they be an error and no one in this house believe for moment that this level of discourtesy would have happen have the partnership be with european country labour have give an effective amnesty to thousand of asylum seeker who be ban under conservative plan labour plan amount to do less than the conservatives be do when we be in government merely change the sign above few desk in the home office with its so call border security command and return unit before the election the right hon lady say that she would create return unit and now the narrative be that she will redeploy some staff not increase the number of staff but redeploy some staff which show that the return function already exist there be no safe third country to which to return people who can not be return home so where will the right hon lady send people who come here from country like afghanistan iran and syria have she start negotiate return agreement with the taliban the ayatollah of iran or assad in syria if she be not go to send to rwanda anyone who arrive here on small boat to which local authority will she send they we be close hotel when be in government so wonder which local authority will receive those asylum seeker if not rwanda will it be rochdale romford or richmond most importantly can the right hon lady now confirm that people who arrive here illegally in small boat will be able to claim asylum finally how long after the right hon lady brief the medium that she be scrap the rwanda partnership do she have the courtesy to speak directly with the rwandan government it be because we now have no deterrent that nobody want to head her new so call border security command neil basu former senior police officer for whom have huge respect be labour no choice and he have rule himself out we now learn that general stuart skeates highly respected former general in the british army who be in large part responsible for deliver the albania deal which cut small boat arrival from that country by have resign from his position as director general for strategic operation to misquote oscar wilde to lose one border commander could be see as misfortune to lose two look like even incompetence notice that the new job advert it be available online for those who be think of apply for labour border security command say that the role be not locate in kent where the channel be but be flexible from belfast bristol cardiff durham glasgow liverpool or manchester none of which the last time check be anywhere near the english channel the reality be that everybody know include the people smuggler that the small boat problem be go to get bad indeed have already get bad under labour because there be no deterrent people be be sell lie when they be be smuggle into this country across one of the busy shipping lane we need to stop they too many life have already be lose sadly six more have be lose in the channel in the last few week and our heart go out to they and their loved one we disagree on many thing but we can agree that we need to put an end to this evil trade sadly the initial decision make by her government have make the problem bad not well welcome the shadow home secretary word about the dedication of home office official and about the importance of work on national security as he know when be shadow secretary of state always work with he and support he around national security issue know he will do the same and welcome he to his shadow post presume what we hear be the first of the conservative leadership contest speech will respond to some of the thing the shadow home secretary say we need to be clear about what we have inherit from he and his party under his party we have have the high level of spring crossing ever gang have be leave to wreak havoc not just along the french coast but across our border through our country and back through europe asylum support cost be set to rise to billion to billion over the next four year as result of his and his party decision as for the idea of deterrence be sorry but four volunteer be send to rwanda be not deterrent to anyone for anything at all the idea that he would spend billion on this fantasy this fiction this gimmick rather than ever do the hard million have already be spend on send just four volunteer in two and half year we have often warn that frankly it would be cheap to put they up in the paris ritz as it turn out it would have be cheap to buy the paris ritz as for the amnesty do not know if the right hon gentleman have ever understand the illegal migration act which he vote for and he inherit from his predecessor he ask if people who arrive illegally can claim asylum that be exactly what happen under section of that act they can all claim asylum enter the asylum system and be entitle to asylum support that be what happen in the system which we have inherit that he have preside over and run since he become home secretary the problem be that people enter the asylum system but never leave he do not bring in operational arrangement to try to take decision properly his home office effectively stop take the majority of asylum decision in may perhaps he do not know that but that be what happen in his home office this party and this government do not believe in amnesty we think that the rule need to be respect and enforce his party be the one that have give an effective amnesty to people who can end up stay in the asylum system forever we believe that the rule should be enforce the problem be that that be what the shadow home secretary believe too he do not believe any of the stuff that he have just say he be only say it for his tory leadership contest he be just too weak to tell his party the truth he think that the whole policy on rwanda be batshit and then he go out to bat for it it be just not serious welcome my right hon friend to her place and thank she for her statement we all suspect that policy in the home office under the previous government be bit of mess but we do not realise how much of an expensive mess it be until she provide we with the detail in her statement let ask the home secretary about the attraction for people to come here illegally to work in the black economy if people have suspicion they have to go to his majesty revenue and customs the gangmasters and labour abuse authority uk visas and immigration and the police to get action to deal with those activity note that the home secretary be look to try to combine the approach to deal with illegal working in the car washing sector will that be systematic change of approach and will it be apply to other sector as well it would be very welcome if that be the case my hon friend be right we must tackle the illegal working and also the exploitation that can often drive lot of what happen that be why we be intensify the immigration enforcement which be part of our new huge expansion to the return and enforcement unit he be right that the process which have become too complicated and too bureaucratic need to be simplify to make sure that the rule be be enforce we have set out the high risk sector on which we wish to focus this summer but we need more systematic approach we have talk about single enforcement approach and we will be set out more detail about those plan call the liberal democrat spokesman in the number of small boat arrival stand at in last year the number have rise to more than what happen in those intervene five year one thing that happen be the closure of the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme which be introduce by the coalition government in and be design to select some of the most vulnerable people from refugee camp in jordan near syria what we have see since the closure of that scheme be people choose instead to make for these shore rather than apply in refugee camp will the home secretary rule out the offshore processing of asylum seeker or will she consider introduce scheme similar to the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme which could incentivise asylum seeker apply for asylum close to the war zone afflict they welcome the hon member to his new post he be right to talk about the importance of the uk do its bit to help those who have flee persecution and conflict it be why strongly believe that the homes for ukraine programme be immensely important personally it have be important to our family it be important that the uk have do its bit include in previous year around hong kong and afghanistan that must continue to be the case but that help must operate alongside properly function system otherwise criminal gang will continue to exploit the system whatever it be at the moment those criminal gang be get away with it let turn to the specific issue of offshore processing in fact the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme be form of offshore processing just as the homes for ukraine scheme be there be different way to arrange these thing our approach be always to look at what work as long as it meet proper standard in term of international law we should be serious about what it be that work in order to tackle the complex problem that we face thank my right hon friend for her statement think that my constituent will be incredulous when they be inform of the extent to which the previous government waste so much money on this scheme what commitment can she give the house that we will be able to rescind our commitment to spend further money on any such programme and that no further public money will be waste my hon friend make really important point welcome she to parliament and welcome she ask question on this issue we have to take strong rigorous and robust approach to value for money in every department it can not simply be the responsibility of the treasury it have to be the responsibility of the home office and of every government department that be the approach that this labour government will take be frankly shocked that under the last government not just the home office but the treasury the then prime minister and his cabinet colleague all sign off on these incredibly high payment and cost they must have have the modelling that would tell they how much the cost would go up by yet they sign off on they our government be determined to pursue value for money at every stage if the number of small boat crossing be high next summer than this summer will she resign realise that the right hon member be keen to get rid of before have even finish stand up at the dispatch box unfortunately we have see succession of conservative home secretaries eight think in the last eight year none of whom resign two of they be sack under the last government actually those two be the same person look we have to be serious about this because the dangerous boat crossing be undermine border security and put life at risk nobody should be make those journey and we have to work not just here but across other european country to stop boat before they reach the french coast in the first place to ensure that life can be save and the gang be hold accountable for their terrible crime thank the home secretary for her statement on the shocking figure that be symbolic of the failure of conservative members to restore control over our border note that despite that spending of taxpayer cash removal of fail asylum seeker and foreign national offender collapse under the conservatives what be the home office do to ensure that those who have no right to be in the uk be swiftly remove and the rule be properly enforce my hon friend make an important point and welcome he to his seat in parliament he be right that removal of fail asylum seeker have fall by third since removal of foreign national offender have fall by quarter that be not good enough it mean that the rule be not be respect or enforce and it be why we will set up new return and enforcement programme we have commit to additional staff to work on return and enforcement to ensure that the rule be respect not only where we have return agreement in place but look at individual case as well we must ensure that we have system that people have confidence in there be lot of chaos to tackle but we be determined to do it the home secretary be absolutely right to lay into the conservatives for their shamble of an immigration policy which will define they for year to come but all be hear be she be hard on asylum seeker enforcement seem to be her priority when will we hear about the safe and legal route that asylum seeker access to come to this country and will she stop the dehumanising and scapegoate language and pledge to take no quarter from the belligerent behind as say in response to the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord ensure that the uk always do its bit to help those who have flee persecution be really important we have do so through different programme in the past we have the syrian family programme back in which be important but we also have to ensure that the system work and have credibility and that the rule be enforce too often at the moment the rule be not enforce but they need to be so that everyone can respect the system also too often we have criminal gang cause havoc able to undermine border security and make huge profit it have become criminal industry along our border and that be deeply damaging agree that this can not be about rhetoric nobody should be ramp up the rhetoric especially alongside gimmick that do not work we have to be serious about this issue and put in place sensible plan that work welcome the home secretary the labour home secretary to her place we have inherit an almighty mess with asylum accommodation cost million per day it be absolute chaos and accord to the sunday times there be even middleman and middlewoman take advantage and profiteer through the system how be she go to get grip of this chaos we have inherit from the previous tory government my hon friend raise an important question as well as failure to tackle the criminal gang take hold along the channel there have also be too much of focus on gimmick and failure to have practical planning in place for example there be failure to ensure that there be proper long term contract on asylum accommodation so that instead the chaos at manston couple of year ago lead to last minute hotel procurement which be completely inappropriate accommodation and cost fortune as well we have to tackle that that be why we have set out plan and we be determined to make sure that we can get that backlog down and end asylum hotel use as result of the chaos with the illegal migration act and the fact that the home office have stop take decision that will now take time and it will be difficult to sort out but that be why the statutory instrument we be lay before the house today be so important that alone should save the taxpayer billion know the labour party manage to go an entire election campaign without answer this question and the home secretary fail to answer it again when ask by the shadow home secretary but will give it one more try where do the home secretary intend to send fail asylum seeker from afghanistan syria and iran the hon gentleman obviously do not understand the system that his party and his government put in place all the people who be in the asylum system be stay there under his policy for those individual they be now be send all around the country into asylum hotel that be the system the conservatives have leave we with we do not think that be the right thing to do we think that asylum decision should be take on case by case basis that be the right thing to do we also think we should have proper return agreement and do what his party should have be do under his own policy for the of people who continue to be entitle to asylum decision but be not get they under his illegal migration act what we will do be run the asylum system effectively which his system should have be do congratulate my right hon friend on the forensic work she have be do in her department what consideration have she give to humanitarian visa for people in gaza to be reunite with their family if they be study in the uk or work in our nhs my constituent have wife and two little child in gaza at the moment he can not return home yet the last government refuse to make provision for they to come and be reunite with he in the uk my hon friend will know that there be long stand arrangement for family reunion and for refugee there be also different concern that have be raise around gaza because there be real importance to people be able to return to their home in the middle east too if she have an individual case that she would like to raise with my hon friend the immigration minister she be very welcome to do so when be in the migrant camp in northern france last year the migrant tell and some of my colleague that one deterrent that would stop they come would be if they be turn back in the channel or send back the same day we see the border force agency take boatload back just last week will the home secretary now with that advice grow political backbone and order the border force to send the boat back the same day the hon member refer to an incident in the channel where there be co operation between border force and the french authority that also involve return people to the french coast that operational co operation be important but would just say to he that co operation be the really important word if we want to prevent gang operate and organising and prevent boat from reach the french coast in the first place we have to work closely not just with france but with germany and other european country and with the country through which some of the supply chain be operate it be that co operation that he and some other in his party have quite often refuse but it will be important and be our good way to stop the criminal gang in few short day my right hon friend have simultaneously save the taxpayer tremendous amount of money and get more people in the home office work on get the system sort than in previous year congratulate she on that do she agree that it be entirely in keep with labour value to ensure safe refuge for those flee war zone and at the same time to ensure that those who be not entitle to be here be repatriate save the uk taxpayer money my hon friend be right there be principle here about do our bit to help those who have flee persecution while also ensure that the rule be enforce so that people who do not have right to be here should be swiftly return at the moment none of those thing apply or be work properly we have to restore order to the asylum system so that we can go back to the principle that go back many year the uk have always stand for it be huge relief that the vile rwanda scheme have be scrap have listen carefully to the home secretary statement give that of people seek asylum in this country be ready and eager to work to support themselves and that freeze they out of work leave they in destitution and mean that the uk miss out on tax revenue from their work and on much need specialist and professional such as the nurse meet recently in an asylum seeker project in bristol will the home secretary take the advice of the united nations high commissioner for refugees and urgently lift the ban on asylum seeker work no do not believe that be the right approach because we need to make swift decision and ensure that the rule be properly respect and enforce be concern about employer who exploit those who have sometimes arrive as result of criminal gang traffic or smuggling do not believe that employer should be able to exploit those kind of route and journey if people who have flee persecution be grant asylum in this country of course they should be able to work and to do so swiftly but if they be not entitle to be here if they have not flee persecution and should be turn down and return to their home country they should not be able to work in the uk my constituent take this issue seriously as they be at the very frontline and the conservatives have leave we with open border thank my right hon friend for deal with the matter with such seriousness how long will it take to put the border security commander in place and what sort of impact will they have in assist law enforcement thank my hon friend and welcome he to his position know that his dover and deal constituency have face real pressure as result of the criminal gang and the small boat crossing thank he for his work and experience in tackle these issue he know very well the work of the national crime agency for example in tackle the criminal gang we be put in place the step for the border security command straight away we have already begin recruitment not just for the new commander but for additional staff hundred of additional cross border police security and intelligence officer and specialist investigator and prosecutor that work will start straight away we have already immediately increase the uk presence in europol and its european migrant smuggling centre so that we can get on with that work to build those partnership and take action be sure the home secretary agree that this be moral issue we must never again see people die in the channel however do she also agree that deterrence must be part of the panoply of measure that we put forward be not clear on what deterrent measure she be go to put in place or because this question have fail to be answer number of time what will happen to fail asylum seeker from country such as syria iran and afghanistan agree with the hon member that it be devastating that life be be lose include child we have see increase violence from some of the gang crowd more people on to these overcrowded boat which have result in seven year old girl lose her life the hon member talk about deterrence the problem with the rwanda scheme be that it be clearly not deterrent four people be send over two and half year be not deterrent at all there be also no deterrent at all for any of the criminal gang which at the moment can operate with impunity so we have to start by ensure that the criminal gang can face justice and that action be take against the supply chain early on that we have consequence and that there be deterrent there would also say that system whereby people can arrive in the uk and stay in the asylum accommodation system forever which be the situation under the illegal migration act which the hon member party vote for mean that there be no disincentive for anyone it make it very easy for people to stay indefinitely and work illegally even if they have no right to be here that go against the rule and mean that the system be just not work thank the home secretary for her statement which contain some really quite revelatory point about the state of the finance sandiacre in my constituency have be home to two asylum hotel one of which be very pleased to see close recently but the best western hotel remain open this be huge cost to people in my constituency and across the nation and it leave asylum seeker catch in an endless and inescapable limbo what step will the home secretary take to ensure that we can close asylum hotel once and for all my hon friend make really important point we need to clear the backlog not just let it grow and grow which be what the conservatives be do but clear the backlog so that we can end asylum hotel which be inappropriate and extremely costly have discover that the home office have effectively stop take the majority of asylum decision under the shadow home secretary the right hon member for braintree mr cleverly who do not seem to know what his own department be do as result of his own policy be extremely concerned that that will now take long to do but it remain an immensely important thing that we have to do the other thing we will have to do be tackle the backlog in the appeal process that the conservatives have allow to grow which be also slow down the system congratulate the home secretary on her appointment and on her statement to the house follow on from previous question but perhaps with nuance will asylum seeker perhaps after initial registration be allow to work and pay taxis while their application be pende if people have right to be in the uk if they have flee persecution and be grant refugee status or they have come to be here on visa through the normal process we will of course have they contribute to our country that have be the case for generation but if people be not here lawfully if they have not flee persecution and should fail the asylum process and be return they should not be work in the uk this be simply about have swift system so that we can make decision quickly and ensure that the rule be enforce be delighted to see my right hon friend in her place on the government benches be proud that bradford be city of sanctuary and of organisation such as bevan health set up by gp in my constituency which work to deliver vital healthcare to asylum seeker who be await decision sometimes for over month and in many case in hotel can my right hon friend provide an assurance that asylum seeker will continue to have access to essential healthcare as our government work to clear the asylum backlog so that in future few people will be leave languish in hotel my hon friend be right it be really important that we try to clear the backlog as rapidly as possible it include some people who be very vulnerable and may be in need of support it also include people who should not be in the uk and the system should operate fairly so that they be swiftly return but we actually have to get back to decision making think would be come to this dispatch box and say well what we want to do be to speed up or accelerate decision making do not think would be stand at this dispatch box say no no we actually have to restart asylum decision making in the first place because the conservatives just stop it really have not expect that it really be far more shocking than have imagine and really think have good imagination when you take drug dealer off the street corner guess what another one appear because of the vile drug trade and the amount of money involve my constituent in boston and skegness believe it be exactly the same with try the home secretary policy of smash the gang if she smash one gang it be like game of whack mole another one will appear and then another one because there be so much money involve here be the point how long will the home secretary give her policy before realise that the only policy that will work be the one she actually start last week which be to pick people up and take they back to france which we be entitle to do under international maritime law it will help british citizen help british taxpayer and help the french and it will reduce the magnet factor say to the hon member that no one should be make these dangerous journey and the criminal gang be make massive profit from organise these boat just do not think they should be able to get away with it and they be at the moment we should be take action against those criminal gang and simply do not accept that it be impossible to go after they we must ensure that we take action not just on the gang themselves but on their supply chain the route the boat be take and their finance and that we properly and substantially increase law enforcement resource as hon member will know we have have case where journalist have identify smuggler and those responsible for be involve in some of the smuggler gang and think those gang member should be face law enforcement it be essential that we do this this be about properly stand up for the rule of law as well as make sure that we do everything we can to prevent these dangerous small boat crossing be very pleased to see the home secretary take her place my constituent in aylesbury have two concern first that we re establish control of our border and secondly that we remember the need for compassion for vulnerable people flee conflict and persecution on that point will she commit to ensure that there be resettlement route for people flee desperate and dangerous circumstance and what will she do to ensure that they be viable my hon friend be right and welcome she to her place in this house think what people in this country have always want be that combination of strong border security and proper fair system so that we do our bit alongside other country to help those who have flee persecution but also so that the rule be enforce and those who do not have right to be here be return she will know that there be series of different resettlement route or different form of support for example the homes for ukraine scheme which continue and some of the afghan resettlement scheme we be concerned about the operation of some of the afghan scheme and we be look far at that to ensure they be function properly thank the home secretary for her statement the tragedy of desperate people die in the channel be compound by desperate people die in the mediterranean and the aegean as human being flee all kind of horrible situation seek place of safety be she co operate with other european country on safe route for asylum seeker be she prepared to look in much more humane way at the desperate situation face people flee human right abuse and war around the world the right hon member make an important point about what be happen in the mediterranean and about the pressure we have see and the fact that as the prime minister say in his statement we have see not just conflict war and persecution but the impact of climate change make people travel and sometimes lead they to make dangerous journey we should be work to prevent the need for those dangerous journey in the first place that be why the prime minister announce last week at the european political community summit that we will invest over million alongside work with other european country also as part of the rome process both to tackle some of the wide criminal gang network that still operate in the mediterranean and to ensure that we address the injustice and serious crisis that lead to people make such dangerous journey in the first place warmly welcome my right hon friend the home secretary to her place one of the consequence of the collapse in our asylum system over the past few year have be the increase and intolerable pressure on local community my constituent in hartlepool raise this with time and again will she outline how the step that she be take will begin to reduce that pressure on community such as hartlepool welcome my hon friend to his place there be real challenge from the chaotic way the asylum system have be run which have lead to the last minute procurement of hotel and have end up be extremely costly everybody lose out from spend billion of pound on this system but also from local authority often not have time to work with community or accommodation provider to ensure that thing be manage in the right way because asylum decision stop be take there will now be some challenge in get the system work again which mean that bring down the backlog will take long than we initially anticipate but we be determined to do this it be the only way to get back to have functional system that everybody across the country should be able to support welcome the home secretary to her place and wish she well for the future and thank she for the helpful and confident answer that she have give there be of course glaring issue regard border security much close to home the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland this border be patrol by republic of ireland official and understandably so as their right to protect their nation be paramount however it be also clear that the good friday agreement do not preclude the need to conduct check on the border what discussion have there be with the police service of northern ireland and security force in northern ireland to ensure that the open border with the republic of ireland do not become free route for uk immigration it be pleasure to get my first question at the dispatch box from the hon member and look forward to very many more he raise important issue the border issue between northern ireland and ireland be of course different we rightly have different arrangement that reflect our long share history but we also have very close co operation we have close policing co operation close information sharing and additional information sharing that be not currently possible under the arrangement we have inherit with other european country it be important that those information share arrangement continue and hopefully we can build on they with other european partner thank the home secretary for her statement share her astonishment at the scale of the mismanagement of the asylum system by the previous government my constituency of colchester have host many asylum seeker and refugee over the year we be city of sanctuary our local authority have play full part in support that work will she confirm that those local authority will be fully engage in the work go forward to ensure that we have more effective support system my hon friend be right to raise the importance of work closely with local authority we be determined to do that the immigration minister already have work in chain look at how we can have well work co operation between the home office and local authority it be also important to recognise that through many generation refugee have come to this country and contribute to our economy and society and be hugely important part of that it be partly because we have that important history that it be crucial to get the whole system function again instead of the chaos we have at the moment which undermine everyone confidence thank the home secretary for her statement the people of burnley padiham and brierfield want to see these crossing stop and these gang smash and they will welcome her tough action today because of the previous government complete failure to control our border they spend million of pound week on asylum hotel what will she do to speed up the processing of people in these hotel and end their use welcome my hon friend to parliament we have to do all these thing we have to take action on the criminal gang exploit the situation in the first place which involve much strong co operation with european colleague that must include the new counter terror power that will be in the new legislation as part of the king speech to strengthen power against organised immigration crime alongside that we have to get the basic right we have to start take decision again as well as speed up asylum decision and make the system work again crowdstrike it outage on friday july we see crowdstrike software update on microsoft system result in major global it outage it cause significant impact around the world impact be see in the transport sector with flight ground in europe and the us and delay and cancellation here in the uk live train departure board be impact during

many firm be able to get back online quickly and the remainder be expect to restore operation this week official from the national cyber security centre quickly establish that the outage be not the result of security incident or malicious cyber activity the cause be instead identify to be flawed crowdstrike software update that cause windows machine to crash on friday morning crowdstrike issue guidance on how to solve the problem give user manual fix for each affected device or system now believe that crowdstrike be in the process of implement an automate update which can be apply remotely and should therefore speed up recovery however there be still residual impact from the fail update and it be important that we continue to monitor the situation and the long term impact to uk sector and secondary impact from international disruption ever since the incident occur the government have work closely with both microsoft and crowdstrike my cabinet office official have be lead co ordination of the government response across all impact sector of the economy that include close monitoring of affected public service to ensure that business continuity plan be enact and service be

normal way as it system be complex we can expect that minor disruption will continue in some area while system continue to recover but my official expect those to be resolve in the next couple of day would like to thank everyone who have work so hard to get system up and run again and all staff who have work tirelessly to support individual impact by the outage follow this incident the cabinet office will work with the national cyber security centre and other partner across government to review the lesson learn the central digital and data office will work with the ncsc to implement any improvement to the exist response plan to cover both technical resilience feature as well as cyber the cobra unit will work with departments to support their process for establish how the organisation and sector they represent manage the impact of the outage and what lesson have be learn as soon as the government be elect we take immediate step to begin legislate to protect public service and the third party service they use our cyber security and resilience bill include in the king speech will strengthen our defence and ensure that more essential digital service than ever before be protect for example it will look at expand the remit of the exist regulation put regulator on strong footing and increase reporting requirement to build well picture in government of cyber threat technology failure can be as disruptive as cyber attack and the move to create the centre for digital government within the department for science innovation and technology be aim at create more resilient digital public sector what this incident show be how dependent the modern world be on complex and interconnect it system and how essential preparedness for such event be include business continuity planning notwithstanding the immense frustration and inconvenience that the outage have cause be pleased to see that effective contingency plan mitigate the very serious impact that the outage could have have be pleased also that there be to be comprehensive process to identify the lesson from this episode hope that they will lead to improvement that both help prevent similar incident and far improve our resilience to system outage and the impact they can have in that spirit commend the statement to the house may begin by welcome the hon lady to her role and thank she for advance sight of the statement in that role know she will be support by dedicated team of civil servant who represent the very good of public service have no doubt that they will serve she as well as they do the hon lady will be aware of the enormous challenge face this government and those around the world in relation to cyber security as warn when be the responsible minister threat to public service and critical national infrastructure come from range of challenge from hostile state actor to human error and design flaw last week we see those challenge vividly bring to life follow the corrupted antivirus update by crowdstrike on friday million microsoft device globally be render unusable that left airport disrupt patient record temporarily lose and gps unable to access important patient datum create significant backlog that be more than an inconvenience pay tribute to all those work in our public service for the effort they undertake over the weekend to restore those service and to the work of dedicated cyber specialist across government include in the national cyber security centre in government we undertake wide range of measure to enhance the nation cyber security create the national cyber security centre introduce secure by design set cyber resilience target launch govassure and transform the oversight of governmental cyber security note as the hon lady say that the government intend to build on that progress by bring forward cyber security and resilience bill will she therefore outline the timetable for the bill and will the government consider mandatory cyber security target for the uk public sector be the government consider obligation to ensure that infrastructure be design to be resilient against common cause problem such as this one what step be be take to enhance cyber security in the devolved administrations and in part of the public sector such as the nhs which be operationally independent specifically in relation to this incident what assessment have be make of the prevalence of crowdstrike within critical national infrastructure what further reassurance can the government give in relation to the timetable for full recovery of key system and datum in particular can the minister assure employee that this month payroll will not be adversely affect britain cyber industry be world lead cyber security now employ more than people and bring in nearly billion worth of revenue annually this transformation be in part due to our billion investment which launch the country first national cyber security strategy therefore urge the government see the chancellor in her place to continue such investment incident such as that of crowdstrike should not deter we from the path of progress we must embrace digitalisation and the huge improvement to public service that it offer the adoption of artificial intelligence across government be the close thing we have to silver bullet for public sector productivity however if we be to command public confidence people must be assure that technology be safe secure and reliable such incident demonstrate how reliant the government and public service be on large technology company and how much responsibility they have for the service that have become critical to people life and livelihood that be why in government call for we to work more closely with lead technology firm to address these share challenge the good solution be partnership to that end what further engagement will the minister undertake with microsoft crowdstrike and the wide sector to ensure that there be no such recurrence the task for we all be to build on exist progress that have transform britian cyber defence and to enhance protection for british family business and the very heart of government in that mission the government can rely on the support of the opposition thank the shadow minister for his contribution and his question in particular echo the thank to all those in departments across the civil service who be involve in deal with the outage last friday and in mitigate its effect set out in my statement that our cyber security and resilience bill which be include in the king speech will strengthen our defence and ensure that more digital service be protect that be priority for this government the bill will look at expand the remit of regulation put regulator on strong footing and increase reporting requirement so that the government can build well picture of cyber threat we will consider the implication of friday incident as we develop that legislation but rest assure that we be work across government to ensure resilience as the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster say in his statement on the covid inquiry module report he will lead review assess our national resilience to the full range of risk that the uk face include cyber risk it be great pleasure to see my right hon friend the minister in her place as she say the crowdstrike outage be reminder not only that technology be so integrated into all our life make they well but also of our dependence on the standard of development deployment and integration of new technology which be largely not visible to we be reassure to hear about the step that the government and business have be take to mitigate the impact but fear that small business and consumer do not have the same resource do she agree that people should not have to be able to reboot from blue screen in order to enjoy the benefit of technology will her government move to ensure that consumer be well protect thank my hon friend for that contribution and want to acknowledge all the work that she have do in this area it have be hugely valuable she make really important point about ensure that consumer and small business be protect as well as government departments and big business be sure that will form part of the lesson learn from this incident and will feed into the bill that we will introduce this be my first opportunity to welcome ministers to their place thank the minister for advance sight of the statement want to focus on the impact on the nhs my thank and be sure those of the entire house go to all nhs staff who have be scramble to deal with urgent inquiry from distressed patient wonder if might press ministers for assurance on two patient group who need time critical care first some patient require blood test result before they can commence urgent treatment or have operation be there any assurance on the attention that they will be give by the nhs both now and in any future scenario secondly there be patient at great risk of become extremely ill from get covid since the previous government scrap the covid medicine delivery unit many vulnerable patient have be struggle to get the anti viral that they need from their gp in time that situation be make much bad when this kind of disruption happen can the hon lady provide assurance about any attention that nhs england have give to those two patient cohort if not be she willing to meet to discuss what we might do in future thank the hon member for her question highlight the issue face vulnerable patient be pleased to report that there be no reported impact on or service and that patient be able to access emergency care the majority of the impact on gp service be in access patient record gp appointment and prescription patient who could not access gp appointment be able to attend urgent care service and gps be able to issue paper prescription however will pass on the hon lady concern to my colleague in the department of health and social care because they be incredibly important issue and we need to ensure that vulnerable patient be protect go forwards may take this opportunity to welcome you madam deputy speaker to your very temporary position and to welcome my hon friend the minister to her role can she give the house any further detail of the impact of this outage in scotland and what conversation have her department have with the scottish government in recent day welcome my hon friend back to the house it be fantastic to see she rightly in her place thank she for the point that she raise which be important and will be take into account in the review of the lesson learn congratulate the minister on her appointment do she agree that these event demonstrate that we be very far from be in position to move to cashless society give that the chancellor be present will the minister confirm that her government will do everything that they can to support the continue use of cash which be so important to some of the most vulnerable people in society cash remain the second most commonly use form of payment in the uk and we remain committed to ensure that individual and business have access to it we have commit ourselves to provide banking hub so that cash remain available to they it be pleasure to welcome the minister to her position particularly as she be sit alongside the chancellor of the exchequer welcome the point make about resilience in public service but can she assure that similar effort be be make to ensure resilience of it in defence context as say in answer to an early question as soon as this government be elect we take immediate step to start legislate to well protect all our public service and the third party service that they use and the cyber security and resilience bill will come before parliament welcome the minister to her position congratulation be due to she understand that she be in charge of the labour party election campaign so she can take some credit for its success it be good to see reward for endeavour and for hard work say to she well do on airline as flight be cancel some of my constituent be stick in london and could not get home to belfast when it come to bank some of my constituent who be out shopping find that their credit card do not work because the system be down when it come to the health system the department of health in northern ireland say that hospital service and about two third of gp surgery face problem there have be for instance problem get patient into operate theatre and with access staff roster the whole system be in absolute chaos do the minister not agree that the issue have underline the necessity of ensure that we be prepared for cyber breakdown whether cause by an intentional attack or cause unintentionally can she say something about our preparedness for situation such as this and about our resilience in move forward from these technological problem for the benefit of those in all part of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland thank the hon member for his kind comment be sorry to learn that some of his constituent be unable to secure flight home or gp appointment in my statement speak about ensure that we expand our cyber resilience put regulator on strong footing and obtain clear picture of cyber threat and how they can be deal with and he raise important point in that regard this be an extremely serious incident that suspect may well be detectable in the next gdp figure that come out of the office for national statistics have two question the hon lady say that she be pleased to say that government service and the online service that the government provide be and remain largely unaffected could she tell we which service be affect or be largely just euphemism for not affect at all secondly it be quite difficult for member to get handle on the full impact and spread of this contagion will she commit to lay before the house some kind of report detail the sector that be affect how seriously they be affect include government system and whether and how there will be any resolution in the future obviously we need to report to our constituent that these thing be less likely to occur in the future set out the impact that the incident have on for example gp service but thing like the emergency service remain unaffected as far as we be aware we be learn the lesson from the incident and be sure that we will report back once that have be complete like so many other gps in my constituency be affect on friday and thank they for the work they do even though patient be not able to get test result and appointment be miss gps manage to make sure that people receive the good care possible what assurance can the minister give that the lesson learn from friday will mean that patient can continue to receive care when they need it welcome the hon gentleman to the house and place on record my thank to gp surgery in maidenhead which do what they could to make sure that the disruption for patient be at minimum we will undertake the lesson learn exercise from this incident hope that offer some reassurance to his constituent as well as the bill that will be go through parliament be aware that the minister be new to her role so will ask she to consider thing rather than to commit to do thing will she please consider continue with the annual statement to parliament on civil contingency and risk which the previous government commit to when she look at the cyber security and resilience bill will she consider assess whether there be widespread use of certain software or hardware that could cause mass outage in the event that it be affect as happen with crowdstrike be not aware that we have see an analysis of that in previous output by the cabinet office and it would be incredibly helpful for we to be aware of where those risk be thank the hon member for those suggestion be very happy to consider the point that she have raise can not be the only member who think how proud mr and mrs reeves must be today debate on the address day debate resume order july question again propose that an humble address be present to his majesty as follow most gracious sovereign we your majesty most dutiful and loyal subject the commons of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in parliament assemble beg leave to offer our humble thank to your majesty for the gracious speech which your majesty have address to both houses of parliament economy welfare and public services inform the house that mr speaker have select amendment table by the leader of the opposition beg to move an amendment at the end of the question to add but humbly regret that there be no mention in the gracious speech of the improved economic condition the government be inherit with the fast record growth in the inflation at the bank of england target for the second month in row and unemployment at half the rate that it be in far regret that there be no mention of how to make necessary saving on welfare urge the government to meet the commitment set out in the labour party manifesto not to raise taxis on work people regret that the gracious speech fail to make commitment not to use change to relief to raise taxis and call on the government to increase income tax threshold to prevent income tax from be charge on the state pension it be an important and rather painful part of our democracy that today be shadow chancellor respond to the king speech in exactly the same way that the new chancellor respond to just few month ago so start by congratulate she as well as mr and mrs reeves as the father of two girl one of whom have her birthday today warmly welcome the smashing of glass ceiling by britain first female chancellor as say on election night she have lead the labour party on difficult journey which have change it for the well her stated commitment to fiscal responsibility stability and economic growth have be consistent and be sure not always easy unfortunately for we her success in hold the line mean that we face rather lot of labour mp on the government benches but wish she well in her new role also commend to the right hon lady the superb treasury official she now inherit and put on record my gratitude to they the excellent work they do for stay up in the middle of the night ahead of fiscal event engage in tense negotiation with spend departments and occasionally it have to be say with no bring endless flat white and pret lunch to keep go and most of all make my family feel welcome in the goldfish bowl that be downing street it be part of the magic of democracy that those same official have seamlessly transfer their allegiance from to she and know that they will serve she extremely well in opposition we will not oppose for its own sake and there be number of bills in the king speech that we welcome the right hon lady be right to focus on growth and the improvement on planning will build on many reform introduce by the last government include the growth measure introduce in last year autumn statement any boost to house building be also welcome we deliver million home in the last parliament and she will soon find out that if she be to deliver million she will not be able to duck reform environmental regulation change that labour block in the last parliament but will deliver an extra home caution she not to over rely on bring back top down target in the end we will build more house only if we change attitude to new housing and that be unlikely to happen if unpopular target be steamroller through local community we will also look carefully at the right hon lady budget responsibility bill we be proud that conservative government set up the office for budget responsibility and commend the work of richard hughes and his team we do not always agree but in the end that be the point of an independent watchdog we all understand the politic of bill that allow the government to make endless reference to the mini budget but if the right hon lady be really commit to fiscal responsibility alongside growth hope that she will today confirm that she will not fiddle with the five year debt rule to allow increase debt through the back door we and it have to be say market will be monitor the overall level of debt very carefully to make sure that that do not happen also hope that she will commission the obr to do year forecast of our long term growth rate rather than five year forecast as at present in order to bake long term decision make into treasury thinking the shadow chancellor be talk just now about fiscal responsibility during the election campaign he commit to series of tax cut but notice that yesterday on laura kuenssberg show he say that it would not have be possible for he to proceed with those tax cut what have change and why do he make that commitment during the election campaign know full well that he could not afford to carry it out be grateful to the hon gentleman for that intervention because it allow to explain why he be completely mistaken in what he be say we offer set of carefully and fully fund tax cut unlike the billion of unfunded spending commitment that come from the labour party but we always say that they would be bring in over time over the next parliament we do not make commitment that they would come in immediately and indeed they would not have we would have do it in responsible way when it come to dubious claim the new chancellor herself have be make some that do not withstand scrutiny she say for example that the economy would have be billion big if we have match the average oecd growth rate but she know that the oecd be diverse group of country include many with economy very different from our own such as turkey mexico or luxembourg much more meaningful comparison be with other similar economy which show that since we have grow fast than france italy germany and japan indeed the international monetary fund say that thank to difficult measure take by the last conservative government we will grow fast than any of those four country not just in the short term but over the next six year one reason for that be our record on attract investment since greenfield foreign direct investment have be high in the uk than anywhere in the world except the united states and china in the last year alone nissan jaguar land rover tata bmw mini google and microsoft have all vote for the uk with their dollar not least because of cut in business taxation such as full expensing introduce by the last government if the chancellor now look for back door way to increase business taxation as many fear she will risk the uk attractiveness to foreign investor of which she be now the beneficiary that investment be very important to my constituent in stockton north where many company be poise to make billion of pound of industrial investment they tell that they prize economic stability above all else so will the right hon gentleman now commit to support the budget responsibility bill to give those investor the security they need yes we be minded to support the bill subject to have have close look at it because we think it be perfectly sensible whether it be completely necessary be different question but it be perfectly sensible we have grave concern about some element of the king speech with times editorial this week describe some of its bills as dose of traditional socialist dogma tony blair come to office have remove the old clause iv of the labour party constitution because he know that state run business be rarely successful and usually end up be bail out by the taxpayer last week with their railway and energy plan the government bring forward more nationalisation than blair ever do indeed more than any government in modern time if the chancellor really care about fiscal responsibility she should beware the reason why union like publicly own utility be that they give they more leverage on pay and more ability to demand bail out unlearn the lesson of history will mean more strike and big bill for the taxpayer an even big concern for business be the impact on job of labour new deal for worker we have see the creation of almost million job since which be nearly job for every single day that conservative governments be in office the president of the confederation of british industry describe the uk as job creation factory but like many other he express concern that the deputy prime minister new labour law could put that at risk day one right sound attractive but employer fear they will mean flood of tribunal claim mean it be safe not to offer job at all that be why the federation of small businesses respond to the king speech by say that company be worried about increase cost and risk in the end french style labour law will lead to french level of unemployment which be nearly double our own indeed they be close to what they be when the last labour government be in office by contrast the conservatives nearly halve unemployment over the last year and it would be tragedy for work family up and down the country if the new government turn the clock back finally the most dubious claim of all be this nonsense about the government have the bad economic inheritance since the second world war which everybody know be just pretext for long plan tax rise people can see what nonsense this be by simply compare it with the last time we have change of government in inflation be compare with today unemployment be compare with today growth be forecast then to be among the slow in the compare with the fast today instead of an economy in which market and the pound be face meltdown the chancellor have inherit an economy in which the office for national statistics have say that growth be go gangbuster that have be back up by even more datum since the election may gdp figure show that britain growth be double the rate predict by economist and the fast in more than two year new figure from show that in february british business be among the most optimistic in the world top of the league again accord to the ons inflation have remain at its target level in her bbc interview yesterday the chancellor gloss over those figure put on the most shocked expression she could muster to pretend that public finance be bad than she expect but the root cause of the pressure on public billion in pandemic support and billion in cost of live support be never secret indeed the labour party support those measure and in some case call for we to go far nor be the difficult decision we have to take to pay for they secret either when we have to increase borrowing increase tax and reduce spending plan in the autumn statement of labour do not oppose we like all chancellors she face fiscal challenge welcome to the job but that job be whole lot easy because face with an economic crisis two year ago conservative take decision that her predecessor labour government duck completely after the financial crisis that be why she have deficit of this year compare with leave behind for the conservatives in she do not just compare her inheritance to she claim to have the bad inheritance since the second world war be she really say that she face condition bad than geoffrey howe in with winter of discontent stagflation an top rate of tax and labour government who go with begging bowl to be bail out by the imf the chancellor know perfectly well that that claim be nonsense otherwise why in her first week would she announce billion of spending on her national wealth fund without spending review budget or any external validation from the obr as paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies say thank to the obr the nation book be wide open and fully transparent so pretend thing be bad than expect really will wash as she establish her reputation it be surely unwise to base her big central argument on claim so patently ridiculous but we all know exactly why the chancellor be do it she want to lay the ground for tax rise she have be plan all along which lead to two major concern first she say she no mission be growth but all around the world evidence suggest country with high taxis tend to grow more slowly low taxis when fund properly boost growth as we see with full expensing and the national insurance cut last year both of which the obr confirm add to our gdp however keep taxis down be hard work see the number the chancellor have see just few week ago and the official advice be clear with public sector pay restraint productivity plan such as those we announce in the budget and welfare reform it be perfectly possible to balance the book without tax rise it be not easy government never be but not impossible yet all those three thing pay restraint productivity improvement and welfare reform be glaringly omit from the king speech instead she have choose an easy path what labour party source tell the guardian be doctor mandate to raise taxis the chancellor have rule out raise income tax national insurance and vat but she should not think for one second that other tax rise will not impact work people capital gain tax destroy the pension people build up over their lifetime business tax rise be pass on to customer lead to high bill and taxis on bank and energy company lead to few company operate in the uk low tax take and less money for public service such as the nhs that be the big contradiction in the new programme government who say they want the fast growth in the but in the very same breath plan tax rise that will make that growth hard if not impossible to achieve even if such an approach be misconceive it be none the less legitimate choice for govern party what be not acceptable be just day after the election to be lay the ground for tax rise after the chancellor promise we time in the election campaign that she have no plan to raise they every labour government in history have raise taxis and raise spending if she want to do the same she should have have the courage to make the case for that before the election instead she be soften we up for colossal turn that will lead to low growth less money for public service and massive public anger which be why commend to the house the amendment in the opposition name it be pleasure to open today king speech debate on behalf of his majesty government always enjoy debate with the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt though must say rather prefer do so from this side of the chamber hon member hear hear appreciate the shadow chancellor generous word on my appointment and also his tribute to official who can confirm be indeed first rate it have be more than year since labour government be in office for state opening of year of chaos year of economic irresponsibility year of waste opportunity and year since there have be labour chancellor of the exchequer stand at this dispatch box today pay tribute to my most recent labour predecessor the late lord darling he be an outstanding chancellor kind man and good friend mr speaker it be also the very first time that there have be female chancellor of the exchequer on my arrival at the treasury learn that there be some debate about when the first chancellor be appoint it could have be year ago when one ralph de leicester be give the title of chancellor of the exchequer for the first time or year ago when henry the treasurer be reference in the domesday book it could even have be year ago when alfred the great be in effect the first master of the mint whichever it be be sure the whole house would agree on one thing that we have wait far too long for woman to be the chancellor of the exchequer hon member hear hear stand here today proud but also deeply conscious of the responsibility that now have responsibility to woman across the country whose work be too often undervalue and responsibility to every young woman and girl who should know that there be no ceiling on their ambition and no limit on their potential seven tory man have stand at that dispatch box over the past year and the result have be an economic crisis crumble public service and cost of living crisis can we expect change of approach from the new female chancellor of the exchequer one thing be that hope to be in post for bit long than some of my predecessor as tempting as it be do not intend to conduct full sweep of the past year of economic history from the dispatch box member ah be sorry however we must talk about the past year warn that whoever win the general election would inherit the bad set of circumstance since the second world war and have see nothing to change my mind since arrive at the treasury will update the house on our public spending inheritance before parliament rise for recess hear what the shadow chancellor say from the dispatch box now and on the television yesterday which be to claim that should be grateful for what he have leave we that be unbelievable because he know the truth and be now try to rewrite history in do so he have remind the british people why the conservatives lose the election they be out of touch delude and unable to defend the indefensible in the week ahead it will become clear what those in his party do they store up problem fail to take the tough decision and then they run away leave it to we the labour government to pick up the piece and clear up their mess today want to focus on one thing above all else economic growth since conservative chancellor after conservative chancellor include the now shadow chancellor stress the importance of growth we have have more growth plan than we have have prime ministers or chancellors and that be quite lot but growth require more than talk it require action like so much else with the previous administration when we scratch beneath the surface the façade crumble and all that be leave be the evidence of year of failure congratulate my right hon friend on her appointment she be make an excellent speech friday ons report show that public sector borrowing be high than forecast do she agree that that underline why it be so important to have fully cost and fully fund manifesto to restore confidence in the public finance and that it be surprise that certain other party do not follow the same route thank my hon friend for that question he speak powerfully and pay tribute to his work in the last parliament particularly around education and skill this be really important point for the most important page of the manifesto that we stand on be the three grey page at the back of it which set out all our spending commitment and how they would be pay for that be important because to earn the trust of the electorate party must be really clear about where the money will come from and what they will use it for that be what we do in our manifesto and it be what we will do in government the shadow chancellor make some point about gdp compare ours with that of other country but since uk gdp per capita that be the most important measure because it reflect how people feel and the money that they have have grow slow than the average slow than the eu average and slow than the oecd average treasury analysis that request when become chancellor show that have the uk economy grow at the average oecd rate these last year our economy would be over billion big today that could have bring in an additional billion of tax revenue in the last year alone money that could have be use for our school hospital and other vital public service growth be about more than just line on chart it be about the money in people pocket and treasury analysis show that achieve the rate of growth of similar economy would have be worth more than for every household in britain the shadow chancellor stand up and once again claim that he bequeath great legacy seriously the last parliament be the first on record where living standard be low at the end than at the start the high level of debt since the the high tax burden in year mortgage through the roof the economy only just recover after last year recession economic inactivity number last week show further rise and borrowing number last week show over billion more borrowing than the obr expect that be the conservatives legacy if that be good inheritance would hate to see what bad one look like think deep down the shadow chancellor know that in fact he do know it yesterday the shadow chancellor admit what we all know that the manifesto that he campaign on be undeliverable and the money for the tax cut that he promise simply be not there if he want to show the country that his party have listen and learn from its mistake he would have use his speech this afternoon to apologise but he do not and that tell we everything that we need to know about this conservative party party first country second political self interest ahead of the national interest irresponsibility before the public good let say this to the conservative party we will not stop hold you responsible for the damage that you have do to our economy and to our country never again will we allow the conservatives to crash our economy they fail this country they shy away from tough choice and we will not repeat their mistake it fall on we this new labour government to fix the foundation so that we can rebuild britain and make every part of our country well off we will govern through action not word and we have already begin to do just that because there be no time to waste less than hour after be appoint as chancellor put growth at the very heart of our work work alongside my right hon friend the deputy prime minister set out reform to our planning system reform that the conservative party do not deliver in year our reform restore mandatory target to build the home that we desperately need end the absurd ban on onshore wind to deliver home grow cheap energy and recover planning appeal for project that sit on the desk of ministers in the last parliament for far too long those be tough decision that the conservative party already oppose why be that my first act as chancellor because get our economy grow be urgent and this king speech show that we be get to work on the matter of mandatory housing target have be constituency mp for year and see they try in number of different way may humbly offer the chancellor this with all sincerity there be such thing as good development but it only work if it be something that we do with people and not to people this stalinist approach will not work have be compare to lot of thing madam deputy speaker but have never be compare to joseph stalin our approach be brownfield first approach we will reintroduce those mandatory target of course it be up to local authority and local community to decide where the housing should be build but the answer can not always be no if the answer be always no we will continue as we be with home ownership decline and mortgage and rent go through the roof on the government side of the house we be not willing to tolerate that this king speech show that we be get to work as my right hon friend the prime minister set out our programme for government be found on principle of security fairness and opportunity our no mission be to secure sustain economic growth in our great country through new partnership between government business and work people that prioritise wealth creation for all of our community we will fix the foundation of our economy so we can rebuild britain and make every part of our country well off there be number of important piece of legislation in the king speech that will help we to grow the economy in this speech will focus on three in particular the budget responsibility bill to restore economic stability the national wealth fund bill to drive investment and the pension scheme bill to reform our economy those bills speak not just to our programme for government but also to trust in politic they show that we will govern as we campaign and that we will meet our promise to the british people in the election campaign say the first step we would take would be to restore economic stability because stability be the precondition to healthy grow economy it be how we keep taxis inflation and mortgage as low as possible after year of irresponsibility we be put our economy on firm ground once again we introduce the new budget responsibility bill on thursday to deliver on our manifesto commitment to introduce fiscal lock so that can keep an iron grip on our country finance the chancellor and sit on the treasury committee together many year ago and she will know from our time together that economics be as much art as it be science give that she be effectively give veto over economic policy to the obr through this bill she must recognise that we need to understand what the people in the obr believe what their theory of economic be and what principle they attach themselves to what further scrutiny of the chair of the obr and the people do the forecast will be available to this house give that effectively they will be co chancellor with she during the next few year the treasury committee as the right hon gentleman know can call in the chair and other member of the office for budget responsibility but his comment show exactly why we need this bill so that never again can we have repeat of the mini budget the bill will require every announcement that make significant permanent change to tax and spending to be subject to an independent assessment by the office for budget responsibility why because unfunded reckless commitment do not just threaten our public finance they threaten people income and they threaten people mortgage we see that in the wake of the mini budget preside over by the former member for south west norfolk understand that she have take umbrage in recent day at the idea that that episode be disastrous well if any conservative member would like to dispute that fact today would be more than happy to give way hon member come on then they cheer it at the time but they be not cheer it now and do not imagine that they would put it on their leaflet the conservatives should be ashamed of what they do because people up and down the country be still pay the price for the chaos that they cause we say never again the budget responsibility bill will enshrine that commitment in law during the pandemic the friend and family of conservatives be award contract for work that be never fulfil my constituent would love to know how we can get their money back perhaps through the covid corruption commissioner enjoy campaign for my hon friend in york outer and it be great to see he in his place today stability mean tough set of fiscal rule but it also mean spend public money wisely as he say the last government hike taxis while allow waste and inefficiency to spiral out of control at no time be that more evident than during the pandemic especially when it come to personal protective equipment the former prime minister when he be chancellor sign cheque after cheque after cheque for billion of pound worth of contract that do not deliver for the nhs when it need it that be simply unacceptable today can announce that be begin the process of appoint covid corruption commissioner to get back what be owe to the british people that money which be today in the hand of fraudster belong in our public service and we want it back the commissioner will report to work with the secretary of state for health and social care and their report will be present to parliament for all member to see will not tolerate waste will treat taxpayer money with respect and return stability to our public finance the second bill will speak to be the national wealth fund bill we know that economic stability be vital for investor and for business the small business look to grow the global business look to expand in the uk the entrepreneur look to take their first step to support they stability must sit alongside investment on the effective use of public fund be the chancellor aware not only of the alleged corruption in the way that covid aid be distribute but of the large number of tax loophole in this economy for example in cornwall over million of taxpayer money be hand out to holiday home owner not only through covid aid but through the small business rate relief scheme and other tax loophole at the same time only third of that amount have go into social housing for first time user will she look at the whole issue of parity in the way public fund be use to support people who need housing welcome the hon member back to this place enjoy spar with he in my early day in parliament and it be great to see he back in the house he be absolutely right that we need to get value for money for all tax incentive will ensure that the treasury and the ministry of housing communities and local government look at the change that he suggest the last government record on investment be dismal we now sit behind every single member of the when it come to business investment as share of gdp that be not an abstract economic problem weak investment hold back productivity and hurt living standard it leave household poorer and wage lower the king speech deal directly with the need to unlock private investment through new national wealth fund bill that will be support by an injection of capital part fund by an increase to the windfall tax on oil and gas giant it will make transformative investment in industry of the future such as carbon capture and storage and green hydrogen it will mobilise billion of pound worth of additional private sector investment in our industrial heartland and coastal community while generate return for taxpayer the national wealth fund will work with local partner include mayor as well as the devolve administrations in scotland wales and northern ireland to develop an investment offer that meet the need of all our nation and region it will simplify complex landscape of support for business today align key institution such as the uk infrastructure bank and the british business bank under the one banner of the national wealth fund heartily applaud what my right hon friend be say about the renew windfall tax will she also look at the fact that in this country we have the low basic rate of tax on oil and gas company anywhere in the world the average be in this country it be as my hon friend know we commit in our manifesto to three percentage point uplift to the current energy profit levy which we will use to fund the national wealth fund that fund will power job and prosperity in all part of our country and that work be already well under way in my first week in office welcome the report of the national wealth fund taskforce and thank the former governor of the bank of england mark carney and the whole taskforce for their outstanding work this bill will put the national wealth fund on statutory footing with clear objective crowd in private investment to create wealth across britain under the conservatives business and work people be hold back by complete and abject failure to build the new home that my constituent in ealing southall be cry out for the laboratory space that will provide the job of the future or the national infrastructure need for business and work people to prosper will my right hon friend assure this house that under her chancellorship we will finally get britain build again welcome the election of my hon friend in ealing southall think her constituent and the whole house can see what strong advocate she will be for her local community she be absolutely right we have to get britain build again we have to build the home and the transport energy and digital infrastructure that our country desperately need thank the chancellor for give the chance to intervene when it come to rebuild and the house building programme that she have suggest should happen in the paper today it be suggest that people on wage of can not get mortgage in northern ireland those on small wage can not get mortgage either so can ask the chancellor this direct and hopefully positive question which will hopefully receive positive answer what can she do to improve access to mortgage for those who want to own their accommodation rather than rent it what can she do to make sure that everyone in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland can benefit as she have clearly say they will thank the hon gentleman for that intervention one of the big challenge people face with get mortgage be build up the deposit that be why we have commit to mortgage guarantee scheme to help those people who can not rely on the bank of mum and dad to get on the housing ladder that be really important commitment as be our commitment to build the home unless we build more home home ownership will continue to go backwards as it do over the past few year alongside stability and investment in our economy must come reform because deliver economic growth require tough choice it mean take on vest interest and confront issue that politician have too often avoid the last government refuse to engage with those choice and refuse to level with the british people about what be require this government will be different we have already demonstrate that through series of reform to our planning system and be bring forward further legislation in the king speech to get britain building today want to focus on another area of our economy where reform be vital our pension scheme people across our country work hard to save for the future they want well more secure retirement with the most generous pension possible at the same time british business with high growth potential need capital to support their expansion pension fund be at the heart of this there will soon be over billion of asset in define contribution pension scheme but for too long those asset have not be target towards uk market that have impact british saver and it have impact british business the last government also say that this be problem and welcome that acknowledgement but they never introduce the legislation need to make the change we believe in deed not word so we will strengthen investment from private pension provider by bring forward the pension scheme bill in the king speech it will boost pension pot by over through new and improved value for money framework through an investment shift in dc scheme just shift in asset allocation could deliver billion of new productive investment into the uk economy to ensure that the bill be as strong as possible be today launch pension investment review lead by the first ever joint commons minister appoint between the treasury and the department for work and pensions my hon friend the member for wycombe emma reynolds the pensions minister this will include review of the local government pension scheme the seventh large pension fund in the world to ensure it be get the good value from the saving of nearly million public sector worker the majority of whom be woman and the majority of whom be low pay they deserve pension that be work for they together these reform will kick start economic growth by unlock investment that have be tie up for too long will the right hon lady give way have already give way to the right hon gentleman order could just urge the house to think about intervention there be very long list of member who want to speak and lot of people who want to make their maiden speech and it would be great if they could all get in madam deputy speaker you will be pleased to know that will not apprise the house of every bill that support economic growth in the king speech needless to say there be many more from the english devolution bill to transfer power back into the hand of local community to the employment right bill to make work pay and the great british energy bill to take back control of our country energy and create new job across the united kingdom grow our economy flow through almost every word of this address the british people put their trust in we on july to fix the foundation of our economy to rebuild britain and to make every part of our great country well off do not take that trust for grant we will not let people down and be ready to deliver the change that we need know it will take time and know it will require hard work but we be already get on with the job by end reckless chaotic approach to economic management by put politic back in the service of work people and by make economic growth our fundamental mission commend the address to the house call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to see you in the chair it be real pleasure to contribute to the debate on behalf of the liberal democrats not just because be speak on behalf of so many more of they than use to but because it give an opportunity to welcome the chancellor of the exchequer to her place and express my personal congratulation on become the first woman in the uk history to hold the position be personally delighted spend many year work in banking and finance and know how male dominate those industry still be wish she well in her new role and look forward to work with she over the come parliament the liberal democrats will be vigorous in scrutinise her plan but we will always work in the national interest and can assure she of the support of the liberal democrats on all those matter on which we can agree be sure that one of the thing on which we can certainly agree be that the right hon lady and her colleague have receive dismal inheritance from the depart conservative administration the number reveal dispiriting picture of low growth high interest rate and record fall in living standard deliver by an out of touch and incompetent conservative party that take people for grant for year our constituent see this situation reflect in the increase in their mortgage payment the hike in their energy bill and the price they pay at the till for their weekly shop they see it in public service that be in state of crisis and an nhs that be fail to deliver the care they need the liberal democrats welcome the seriousness with which this king speech focus on stability reinveste in our crippled public service and grow the economy we welcome measure such as the introduction of an industrial strategy council to co ordinate policy on economic growth but the immediate and press problem that our constituent be face in their everyday life can not just be address by centralised top down institution run from whitehall our economy need to grow from the bottom up bring prosperity to every community take away the barrier to entry for small business and enable individual across the country to make the most of their skill and talent the liberal democrats want urgent measure introduce to give immediate support to family and small business while out on the doorstep during the general election campaign and my colleague hear clear message from our constituent that their big priority be fix the nhs we be here because we promise to fight hard for well nhs for our constituent and for community across the country that be why we be call for the chancellor to immediately draw up budget for health and social care we can not deliver economic growth without fix the crisis in our nhs and in social care nhs waiting list be at an all time high it can take week to see gp and it be now almost impossible to see an nhs dentist everyone deserve access to the care they need when they need it and where they need it successful health and social care system be fundamental to fair society and our country prosperity the failure of the conservative administration lead to dramatic increase in the number of people experience long term sickness condition and the liberal democrats will continue to push for public service investment to help reduce nhs waiting list to get people back to work do my hon friend agree that reform social care should be one of the most urgent priority of this government the royal cornwall hospital nhs trust recently announce that million year be spend on patient who be medically well but unable to be discharge due to lack of social care package my hon friend be right and it be wonderful to see he in his place the people of north cornwall will be well serve by his championing of social care which be front and centre of the liberal democrats manifesto in the general election the most direct way to alleviate poverty be to increase the money pay to the poor household we know that our fellow citizen who be live in the severe poverty be likely to be family with small child grow up in poverty affect child educational chance and be likely to impact their physical and mental health hold they back from achieve their true potential take immediate step to tackle child poverty should therefore be priority we believe that remove the two child cap be the most cost effective way of immediately lift child out of poverty while help to make cost more manageable for parent that would have direct benefit to family struggle with the cost of living crisis not only do we have moral obligation to change this unnecessary policy but it be the most cost effective way of alleviate poverty with broad range of economic advantage include support more parent back into the workforce so urge the chancellor of the exchequer to remove the two child limit on social security payment in her budget to ensure that all family who need it receive immediate reassurance and support but family of all size be suffer under the cost of live crisis and desperately need help our school be increasingly have to battle the effect of poverty to ensure child be able to attend school and have the good chance of reach their potential and too many child be distract from their lesson because they have not have enough to eat the liberal democrats set out plan in our manifesto for free school meal for all child live in poverty with an ambition to extend they to all child once public finance allow the liberal democrats be call on the government to consider fund free school meal as priority to alleviate the pressure on the finance of the family who be struggle the most this will also contribute to positive educational outcome that will benefit we all in the future the liberal democrats welcome many of the measure in the king speech that aim to boost economic growth and we support the government objective to make that priority we welcome move to boost stability and provide strategic leadership via an industrial strategy council and to increase investment through pension reform however our small business and local high street need immediate support and the government need to do more to ensure economic growth can reach every part of the united kingdom and that small business and entrepreneur can quickly rediscover the confidence that they need to invest after year of conservative chaos and mismanagement liberal democrats want to see more direct support which will impact local community business we believe we need swift action specifically to tackle high energy cost and we continue to call for business rate reform new parliament present real opportunity to begin to properly rebuild our trading relationship with europe from speak with many small business owner understand the pressure and limitation that current trade deal with europe pose to business we must tackle the arduous legislation around import and export good which significantly limit the opportunity for small business to grow the liberal democrats have comprehensive plan to rebuild trust and co operation with europe and we understand that to be crucial aspect of the support that business urgently need we welcome the government acknowledgment of the need to reform the apprenticeship levy however we would like to see they go far and replace the current scheme with broad and more flexible skill and training levy we hope that the government will join we in encourage the take up of apprenticeship particularly for young people and support our call to guarantee that they be pay at least the national minimum wage by scrap the low apprentice rate we understand the broad economic benefit of support the development of skilled worker and be optimistic about the advantage that can bring to business the recent year of chaos and irresponsible conservative administration have leave substantial challenge for the new government to tackle we do not underestimate the work lie ahead to get the economy back up and run to nurture an environment that will allow business to thrive and to restore the public service that provide care for people when they need it my liberal democrat colleague and will hold the new government to account to ensure that they deliver on the promise outline by his majesty on wednesday as we work to rectify the damage do by the conservatives rebuild our economy support individual community and small business and urgently invest in health and social care rise the dilemma we face be self evident many hon and right hon member want to speak and we will do all we can to get in as many people as possible unfortunately there will now be five minute limit on speech the clock will not be use for maiden speech but we ask members to keep an eye on the time it be an honour to speak in this king speech debate and privilege to have hear the first female chancellor in our history deliver such remarkable opening salvo will say word not just about the king speech itself but the strategy behind it when the chancellor and my right hon friend the prime minister launch our manifesto there be clear ambition at its heart to ignite revolution in wealth creation in this country not just for some but for all that strategy be absolutely right because among the bad of our inheritance be the scandal the moral emergency of the inequality of wealth that now scar our country madam deputy speaker you and could take walk this afternoon down to coffee bar call shot in mayfair which would serve we coffee for shot we could go next door to restaurant aragawa where they serve steak for apiece some if they be lucky enough could book night at the raffles hotel for these be extraordinary price but not unremarkable in country that now have the high sale of rolls royce superyacht and private jet this absurdity of affluence sit alongside country where on the last figure more than people die homeless ten of thousand of people be die from the disease of poverty and million people can put food on the table only because of the tender mercy of food bank that be the inequality of wealth bequeath to this government it be well illustrate perhaps by one figure the wealth of the top have grow by time the wealth of everybody else over the past year that be why my right hon friend the chancellor be right to say that there have to be revolution in wealth creation in this country not just for some but for all the measure that my right hon friend have set out be the right one plan for growth and plan to devolve economic power out of the paralysis of westminster and whitehall and down to mayor and local council alongside that be revolution in planning law infrastructure law and skill finance urge my friend on the government front bench to maximise the amount of power hold locally because it be local people and local leader who know good how to grow our economy if we have grow economy the key be then to ensure that growth be fairly share that be why the employment right bill be so important as my right hon friend say there have not be growth in living standard for more than year that be why we need to ensure that there be fair day pay for fair day work alongside that the draft equality bill be extremely important and urge my right hon friend to go far and to use the consolidation of pension fund to inaugurate an era of civic capitalism in this country where we use the combine trillion worth of pension saving to encourage business that be good not business that be bad such as those that she reveal when she be brilliant chair of the business and trade committee or the scandal that we expose in the last parliament with mcdonald asda and other firm behave in way reminiscent frankly of victorian capitalism once we have begin raise income we must help people build well that be why the change to the housing market that my right hon friend propose be so important we can underpin that and maximise investment into the infrastructure of this country by ensure that there be national wealth fund but would go far and ask she to look at how we can put together not just the national wealth fund but the crown estate fund which be set for reform under bill in the king speech we could go step far and review the whole portfolio of investment hold by the government and by uk government investments the last government make some pretty strange investment during covid include understand buy share in bolton wanderers share in bespoke boutique whisky company and even it be say in some newspaper share in strange firm that organise international sex party call killing kittens say to my friend on the government front bench that it be time we have domesday book that consolidated asset in this country let we look at what we need and what we do not crucially let we look at how we maximise dividend go to ordinary work people in this country to help they build wealth for themselves conclude with this on the government benches we have long know that we only deliver and maximise freedom and opportunity for people in this country and make those freedom and opportunity real if there be security there be no security without wealth which be why the ambition that my right hon friend set out not simply to build wealthy democracy but democracy of wealth be the right one may start by add my congratulation to the chancellor on be the first woman to hold that office in the history of our country at this rate the labour party might even have female prime minister some time this century also thank the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt for everything he do while in office in particular thank the voter of west worcestershire for return here for the fifth time be one of those who be here in it be ironic that should be follow the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne because he be the one who leave that famous note sorry there be no money leave if people want to know what bad economic legacy look like be here in when we receive one from the labour party the deficit be over and rise and unemployment be over inflation be nearly twice its target and the banking system have just collapse and have to be bail out by taxpayer we can contrast that with the economic legacy of that the new government inherit despite the economic cost of the pandemic and the energy crisis the uk be enjoy the fast growth in the unemployment be now half the rate it be in inflation be back on target we have well capitalise banking system almost completely out of taxpayer hand wage be now rise fast than inflation we be the fourth large exporter in the world member do not have to take my word for it they can take the word of the international monetary fund which in recently publish report say that the uk economy be approach soft landing with growth recover fast than expect inflation have fall fast than be envisage the banking system remain healthy so approach the economic measure in the king speech with degree of trepidation because they come at time when the economy be back on track while agree that secure economic growth be fundamental mission of government would add the word non inflationary have look and look through this king speech and can not see any measure that magic up economic growth growth do not just happen because it be write into the king speech in my time as chair of the treasury committee we have the opportunity to have private session with the imf it be interesting to observe that many of the measure put forward by the government in the king speech be in the imf prescription for the uk economy reform planning and building on our beloved green belt be from the imf as be strengthen the role of the office for budget responsibility and crowd in private capital on net zero project via national wealth fund what else do the imf want well colleague may not be surprised to learn that it also want to see more taxis it do not quite say it like that it call it close tax loophole or mobilise additional revenue some of the measure we hear about in our private session with the imf be as follow the first be set capital gain tax rate in line with income tax rate hope that ministers will rule that one out the second be subject the sale of primary residence to capital gain tax hope that ministers will rule that one out the third be end inheritance tax loophole for pension family business and farm hope that ministers will rule that one out the fourth be revalue all of england home for council tax and especially those over in value hope that ministers will rule that one out the imf also like the idea of road pricing hope that ministers will rule that one out it also want to bring forward considerably the date at which the state pension age increase give that those be all tax measure that the imf recommend be sure that the chancellor be begin to contemplate they when the government respond to today debate hope that they will specifically rule those thing out because the tax rise that the government admit to already the pensioner tax the tax on education and regulatory cost galore be bad enough let we hear some specific denial on those other taxis call georgia gould for her maiden speech be pleased to speak in debate with so many strong female representative include the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin and be really honour to speak in debate lead by the first female chancellor of the exchequer who have

have hear from hon member from across the uk we all have that in common the privilege and the responsibility of bring the voice of our community to this place we may debate and disagree but hope to always listen and learn and remember that we be be entrust to weave those story hope and ambition together into national vision for this country one that govern for all and leave no one behind congratulate the hon member for queen park and maida vale georgia gould on simply superb speech that follow the good tradition of the house she have do her constituent proud and know that she bring huge expertise and commitment to this house wish she all the good put on record my thank to the good people of fareham and waterlooville for send back to parliament we have fantastically energetic let put it that way and hard fought campaign be honour and humble to have the privilege to speak on their behalf in this chamber one thing strike in the king speech not the long list of policy that will no doubt damage our economy or the vague promise that will not survive contact with reality for the thing that be conspicuous by its absence be the total failure of the labour government to deal with child poverty and scrap the two child benefit cap on welfare interruption yes hon member hear that right interruption order could we show respect and listen to the member speech detect bit of surprise on the government benches have rise to speak on scrap the cap in the grand tapestry of british politic where the warp and weft of policy and principle interlace it be not often that conservative mp will find thread of agreement with friend across the aisle but here we be discuss proposal back by labour mps lead by the hon member for liverpool riverside kim johnson and back by the liberal democrats the scottish national party and many opposition party it be one with which agree because it speak to my profound sense of justice and dare say compassion will say why conservative can and should back scrap the cap let we not rewrite history because there have be lot of nonsense from labour front benchers about the situation that we inherit in to put it simply we inherit no less than an economic catastrophe and we work hard to recover from that situation the deficit stand at in we get that down to public sector net borrowing be at we get that down to we be in deep recession and we now have the fast grow economy in the we have to make incredibly difficult decision back in to reduce our welfare bill but it be clear to that through those welfare reform spearhead by my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith we overhaul an overly complex bureaucratic system and help million of people get back into work four million more people be in work now than in the unemployment rate be down to half what it be in we can make change to some of the decision that we make back then it be clear to from my work with vulnerable family in fareham that the cap be not work it be push more child and family into relative poverty cause they to use more food bank there be three good reason for scrap the cap will the right hon and learn lady tell the house who introduce the cap why and which way she vote when the measure go through this house just set out that the parlous economic situation force we to make impossible choice but thank to the improved economic and the improvement bring about by universal credit believe that it be time to put child poverty first and scrap the cap there be three big reason for conservative to support that first it be affordable for about of total government spending we could quickly bring around child out of poverty in this improved situation that be the fair and right thing to do secondly the reason why it be introduce in the first place be to disincentivise poor family from have more child but that have not necessarily work the number of child bear have remain relatively stable as the joseph rowntree foundation find heartbreakingly of child in large family be in poverty the child hard hit be those under four it predominantly affect young child and those in large family believe that the cap be aggravate child poverty and it be time for it to go know that there be the argument do have child if you can afford they to that be not compassionate fair or the right thing to say as conservative we should be proudly and loudly the party of family we should encourage family on low income to have more child for those family on middle and high income we should change our tax regime so that they be incentivise to have child we have well parental leave policy well childcare provision policy and well maternity care be conservative because believe in the strength and the sovereignty of the family unit we should support it not suppress it this be not about right or leave this be about right or wrong let we come together in spirit of compassion and common sense to scrap the cap and end child poverty for good call sarah sackman to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to follow the right hon and learn member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman like other member be somewhat surprised by her rewrite of recent economic history she have year to fix the problem of child poverty and do precious little to do that listen today to the chancellor of the exchequer lie out this government plan to restore economic stability and growth to this country that be what will lift million of child out of poverty in the long term it be privilege to stand here today represent the place where be bear and raise finchley and golders green would like to start by pay tribute to my predecessor mike freer although we disagree on many thing mike be dedicate to our area both as member of parliament and as leader of barnet council admire his commitment to public service and in particular his role in secure equal marriage legislation for same sex couple legacy that he can take enormous pride in but the circumstance under which mike decide not to stand for re election be appal we should have be able to face each other on the basis of our idea but mike life and office be threaten by those who believe in the bullet not the ballot box it be stark reminder of the fragility of our democracy both at home and abroad want to use my time in this place to stand up for the democratic value and process that believe in witness the dignified and smooth transition of power last week in all part of this house be something we can take pride in we must ensure that we work together to defend the safety of public servant wish mike and his husband angelo all the good in their future also pay tribute to the much miss dr rudi vis who hold special place in the heart of my local community not least as the first labour member to represent this special patch of north london in over century be only the second person from my party to be send to this place by the people of finchley and golders green be also only the second woman some member may remember the first when mrs thatcher enter this place she be make to wait two whole year to make her maiden speech but in our era of breakneck news cycle and with so much work that want to do have to wait just two week have feel like very long time have delay long enough mrs thatcher do not waste second when she rise to her foot break convention by make her maiden speech on private member bill that she introduce this be maiden speech she say her sonorous tone echo through this hallowed place but know that the constituency of finchley would not wish to do other than come straight to the report february vol the people of finchley and golders green rightly remain as demand of their elect official today so too will come straight to the point like mrs thatcher be patriot and want our community and our country to prosper and be an influence on the global stage but unlike she fundamentally believe that there be such thing as society society be not an abstract idea to be bury in sociological essay we can see it in the rich tapestry of community that come together across finchley and golders green may be the first female jewish gibraltarian mp from this constituency but would not be here without the support of my neighbour and my community the cypriot community the somali bravanese the kosovan the japanese the irish and hindu community the lawyer and the uber driver the charity worker and the campaigner the spurs fan and the fan of some other north london team whereas in recent time some politician have choose to use north londoner as an insult my constituent and wear it as badge of pride it symbolise place that celebrate diversity hard work and look out for your neighbour our diversity come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the history of our area where else can boast the parish where archbishop desmond tutu hone his ministry in the terrible year of exile during apartheid in south africa and the childhood home of the late and great rabbi jonathan sacks man who teach we that good society be one that offer all its member equal access to hope it be in east finchley that george michael first tinkle the ivory and amy winehouse first take the stage finchley and golders green have quiet radicalism bake into its history take hampstead garden suburb where grow up project drive by the extraordinary henrietta barnett in the early century one of the first garden city it be groundbreake development she also set up toynbee hall in london east end where begin my legal career as volunteer at the free legal advice centre see there just how important the law could be for tenant face eviction and woman suffer unequal pay now want to take those value of access to justice and commitment to the rule of law into my new role as solicitor general when in we witness the opening of golders green underground station advert at the time dub our area place of delightful prospect can vouch for the fact that never truer word have be speak but this place of delightful prospect have suffer in recent year my community have witness rise level of antisemitism and islamophobia these be scourge on our society and as long as be in office will tirelessly call they out and work to eradicate they our community today be increasingly become place of busy food bank and empty mansion inequality be writ large stunt people health and potential many across finchley and golders green be struggle with the spiral cost of living this have to change not just in my constituency but across the whole country our nhs be break the prison be full the police can not respond when they be call out and our teacher be not support to deliver we need to get britain back on track and the bills set out in the king speech be exactly what we need to take the brake off the economy and restore and rebuild our public service my constituent be rare to go whether it be the brent cross town development one of the large regeneration development in europe or our brilliant high street business and local entrepreneur all we need to get grow be government who be on our side well we have that government now so to quote my famous predecessor let get straight to the point and let get on with the change that britain truly need the shift to green economy represent the most significant transformation for century we must reverse the damage rhetoric by the fail conservative government that the economy will suffer if we be uncompromise in our ambition to get to net zero this be not an either or of economic growth or investing in the green economy the green economy be at the heart of economic growth we must end our reliance on oil and gas renewable would mean cheap energy bill across the country and we would no long be reliant on dictator such as vladimir putin who use natural gas as weapon as well as be more affordable renewable be the good route to energy security under the tory party renewable project face long delay and cost skyrocket the new government reversal of the de facto ban on new onshore wind be welcome we be also glad restriction on new solar have be reverse the liberal democrats share the ambition of the government climate agenda but we will also ensure that these project have local buy in local authority must play lead role in deliver climate action and the community that host the new infrastructure must directly benefit from it for example there be huge growth potential in community energy the liberal democrats be call for small scale renewable energy generator to receive guarantee fair price for the electricity they sell back to the grid community benefit and individual economic incentive be crucial to secure support and active participation in our energy transition in both the labour and the liberal democrat manifesto there be clear commitment to tighten energy efficiency standard for private landlord national energy action have warn that the statutory fuel poverty target can not be meet without do so the king speech provide an opportunity for the new government to set that as priority in their new renter right bill but it be miss out hope the government will hear this and ensure that improvement to energy efficiency for renter materialise before the situation worsen under the previous conservative government the cost of living crisis be exacerbate by rise in travel cost particularly for commuter it be not clear how labour plan for nationalisation will do anything to alleviate the high cost of travel by rail we urge the new government to freeze rail fare and simplify ticket to ensure that regular user be pay fair and affordable price for too long decision over local transport have be centralise liberal democrats have long argue for lift the ban on local authority franchise bus it be reassuring to see that the government recognise the importance of local decision making however council will need adequate resourcing to expand service we be yet to see strategy for that we would also like to see long term plan from the government for further electrification of the rail network not provide one would be dereliction of duty to reduce emission and improve air quality look forward to work together constructively with the new government to turbocharge our energy to get to net zero and to make sure we really improve our green public transport and grow the huge opportunity of green economy call andrew lewin to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to make my maiden speech in this debate it be privilege to follow the first female chancellor in history and to follow two inspire maiden speech from the labour benches by my hon friend the members for queen park and maida vale georgia gould and for finchley and golders green sarah sackman it be an honour to sit alongside they on the government benches and their community be both very lucky to have they as hon member can imagine have give careful thought to my remark today but it be safe to say that this be not the most anticipated maiden speech ever associate with welwyn hatfield the reason for that be that on november elizabeth give her inaugural address as queen from hatfield house in my constituency irrespective of how the next few minute go think her place in history be safe be especially grateful to be call in this debate on the economy my constituency be anchor by two new town that flourish under previous labour government hatfield and welwyn garden city be incorporate as new town together under single development corporation on may the growth of hatfield and welwyn garden city play an important role in the rebuilding and reimagining of life in our part of the country after the horror of the second world war believe that if we be to succeed in grow our economy we have to rediscover the ambition and the vision that be embody by those who design and carefully plan our two great town my predecessor as the mp for welwyn hatfield be the right hon grant shapps who serve our community for year and will be well known to all member of this house in fact he will probably be familiar to anyone who be watch morning television news programme at any point over the last five year before talk about grant legacy however want to start with message of reassurance to the labour whips and my colleague have no desire to hold quite so many cabinet position as he do and certainly not in such short period of time want to reflect solemnly on the personal and professional commitment that grant shapps make to the people of ukraine after the russian invasion in he open his family home to provide sanctuary to three generation of ukrainian family innocent people whose life be turn upside down by putin unprovoked act of aggression in the last parliament more than ukrainians be welcome to our country under the ukraine family scheme and the ukraine sponsorship scheme an initiative that believe show our country at its good open and welcome in an hour of grave need we serve in this house of commons at time when our wide political discourse can often be angry and divisive of course we will disagree in the house and passionately so our constituent rightly expect we always to stand up for our community and our value and will certainly try to do just that but think we can too easily forget what unite we where we agree let we have the confidence to say so my predecessor be right to champion the people of ukraine and the cause of freedom and democracy commend he for it and wish he well in whatever come next welwyn hatfield be constituency rich in history welwyn village and woolmer green be both roman settlement and welwyn be one of the few place in the country believe to have be occupy continuously for year nearly year after hatfield be home to queen elizabeth local people make an important contribution to the defeat of nazi tyranny the royal air force mosquito fighter bomber be develop at the de havilland airfield and aircraft factory in hatfield welwyn garden city also have unique place in history as the creation of ebenezer howard the father of the garden city movement his immaculately planned and tree line street such as parkway in welwyn garden city be still true to his vision from nearly year ago despite our wonderful history what have strike when have walk around our town and village be the impression of too many project on hold and potential go unfulfilled take the iconic shredded wheat silos design by louis de soissons in and define feature of welwyn garden city for decade the site have lain virtually dormant since the factory close in in central hatfield it be similar story queensway house consist of unit that be once all social housing in november after ballot of resident majority decide that it be time to demolish and rebuild but nearly five year later queensway house be still stand and it loom over the centre of hatfield as symbol of the inertia that have capture our politic for too long be determined that that must change the centre of hatfield be one part of our community that most urgently need investment in good quality housing and social infrastructure and will be champion for it in this house welwyn hatfield be grow and increasingly diverse community in just the last few month have attend the world street food festival in welwyn garden city the first ever diwali celebration in white lion square in hatfield and the ever popular welwyn festival on singlers marsh we be home to prominent national business include tesco and ocado in hatfield and to the thriving university of hertfordshire the university will soon be open its state of the art spectra building for the study of physics engineering and computer science and yes mr vice chancellor as this will appear in hansard please consider that to be my formal bid for an invitation to its opening believe that new parliament be time for ambition and optimism welwyn hatfield blossom when attlee labour government put housing and carefully plan community at the centre of their agenda for change nearly year later we have another majority labour government with mandate for national renewal this be moment of opportunity and each of we on these benches have responsibility to play our part in realise it for as long as serve in this house of commons will always do my utmost to champion welwyn hatfield to respect our history and to be an agent for change rise order let just give the house reminder not that the next member will call need this reminder that for those of we who could be describe as veteran member it be the custom to praise maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker may say what pleasure it be to follow the hon member for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin he speak with great eloquence and also with passion about his constituency know what wonderful moment it be when we give maiden speech we all have that honour when we enter the house welcome the hon gentleman to his place and look forward to work with he in the year to come of course hertfordshire be next to the county where my own constituency be locate essex and hertfordshire be twin county so we be neighbour in some sens and also look forward greatly to hear more from he in the month and year ahead think that one of our colleague who speak early forget to welcome the hon member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman know that constituency well campaign for mrs thatcher in as young conservative at the age of know ballards lane very well and have often be to margaret thatcher house must commend the hon lady on her kindness and the generous word that she speak about not only margaret thatcher but my friend mike freer whom we be sad to lose in the election know that she will be fine champion of finchley and golders green which be proud constituency with great identity and look forward to visit finchley again while the hon lady be in place as the member of parliament do apologise to the hon member for finchley and golders green and to the whole house for not recognise my duty to thank the hon lady for her wonderful speech this mean that even after seven year in the house one sometimes forget to do certain thing it be very good to see the hon lady in the house and particularly enjoy what she say about the rule of law be deeply proud to have be elect for the seventh time as the member of parliament for romford be now the long serve mp for romford since when the constituency be create be here because believe in thing be here not because seek title and position but because believe in this country and be also passionate about my constituency because it be where be from think that those of we who come from our constituency know how important it be to represent place where we have live all our life and will always be proud of be the mp for my home town as have say believe in thing and believe first in this country let say to ministers whom congratulate on their election to power that thing change and government come and go but the one thing that we must never give away be the freedom and liberty of the british people say to they whatever you do please do not reverse the big democratic decision that the british people make we want to have sovereignty we want to have the right of self governance but we also want prosperity and that mean free enterprise low taxis and small government it do not mean create large centralisation of power margaret thatcher teach we that if we have low taxis and free enterprise if we give people the freedom to prosper and make their own decision in life in the end we create more prosperity and more opportunity for all that be sure be what all of we in all part of the house want to see so let we learn from past mistake respect the fact that we have different opinion on many issue and also understand that all of we here want the good for our country and our constituency however believe that if we want economic prosperity we need government to stay out of people life we need to allow business to flourish we need less regulation and we need to cut unnecessary public expenditure so that people be not pay high taxis which disincentivise work and put people off from invest in our country hope that the government have take office will pay heed to that also say to they that yes we want to protect our environment but we have to think very carefully about the evangelism of net zero we do not want to make our country cold and poor and to give competitive advantage to other country that do very little about climate change and have not meet their target be afraid the policy that the government have adopt will deliver more power to china so warn they about go too far in that direction believe that we should be parliament that make decision so disagree with more and more quango committee of expert and body that be not democratically accountable have so much say why be we effectively give the office for budget responsibility veto over the right of this parliament to decide economic policy surely that be something that the government should think again about before have to end would like to say that if we be serious about devolution we should give all part of the country great control over their local community borough such as havering would rather be independent we do not want to be under greater london we want power devolve back to our local community historically we be part of essex and we do not like be control by city hall and certainly not by the current mayor of london represent the people of romford and they would agree with what have say let we have free enterprise true devolution and above all prosperity for the british people but let we also stand up for our country abroad and at home call miatta fahnbulleh to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker may start by

state serve as home secretary and chancellor of the exchequer sir sajid be man whose north star be his integrity and he have devote much of his time to support and champion good and noble cause include as many in this house know suicide prevention bromsgrove constituency be for the unfamiliar in worcestershire bromsgrove town its namesake be proud of its history and tradition which include historic court leet centre around the parade on fair day hold on the close saturday to midsummer and in celebration of the charter grant to the town by king john this heritage go far and bromsgrove proud son and daughter include the poet and scholar housman and his sister clemence who could not fail to mention here in this house give the role that she play in the suffrage movement my constituency however be much broad than just one town there be many more village and hamlet and be rural bromsgrove epitomise the very good of worcestershire there be roll hill and thriving village where the community spirit be strong include clent dodford stoke prior belbroughton romsley finstall barnt green cofton hackett tardebigge and alvechurch there be other community on the fringe of the constituency whose identity be root proudly in worcestershire include hagley rubery wythall major green and there be even touch of glamour in hollywood commit myself to represent they all our village be home to rural enterprise and to farmer who we all rely on three time day and who be guardian of our countryside often work in isolated or harsh condition both physically and in competitive marketplace it would be easy to be lull into think that bromsgrove be somewhere quiet and without ambition but hon member must not be fool the sunday times recently highlight how south bromsgrove high school be powerhouse of aspiration and entrepreneurship produce young high achiever who have go on to find lead company in their sector include gymshark and aybl it be in no small part down to the

district council where champion the importance of design code and the role of beautiful design in deliver quality community that inspire sense of pride nod to our past and catalyse the economic and social investment that allow our town and village to flourish we must do this by shift our collective focus away from beautiful design be see as cost and towards see it as an investment that pay dividend in the form of thrive community and vibrant place where aspiration can bloom this be critical across bromsgrove place that be green belt and be the rural buffer between worcestershire and the urban sprawl of birmingham to ensure that we protect our green open space and do not build identikit monotony all over the countryside instead focus on deliver quality home with appropriate landscaping and mix of texture and colour with genuine local support first over the come year we must never forget that the single big driver of our economic success be thriving free market an environment where business be incentivise to invest create the prosperity that will underpin our national success the government must exercise restraint as they seek to create new bureaucracy which increase the size of the state under the veil of public service reform and they should be cautious as additional spending fund through taxation or borrow without serious structural reform of public service delivery will fail every stakeholder who interact with public service in my constituency bromsgrove school found in employ over local people and contribute million to the gdp of the uk while every member of this house would surely agree that education be the foundation of prosperity the government proposal to impose vat on these school be not only an ill conceive affront to the child and family who currently exercise choice in education provision but an attack on the wide education system that will undoubtedly do little to enhance the quality of state education and will instead level down education standard across the board say that as someone who be proudly educate in excellent state school we must also show determination in deliver vocational skill in agriculture manufacturing technology engineering and trade which will bolster our prosperity raise our baseline level of industrial resilience in world where our adversary want to blunt our competitive edge food and energy security be two of the most significant and interlinked contemporary challenge that we face the government must remain pragmatic in their effort to deliver on both ensure that in everything they do they do not worship at the altar of ideological purity and inadvertently sacrifice our own long term economic success in the process in the word of housman the house of delusion be cheap to build but draughty to live in and ready at any instant to fall look forward to play an active role in this house deliver on behalf of my constituent and in the long term national interest of our country start by congratulate all those who be make their maiden speech today and welcome they to this place also thank my liverpool riverside constituent who re elect give my commitment to continue to be their voice in this place my constituency be now the most deprived in the country with of child live in poverty that be nearly one in every two child and it be community such as mine that have face the sharp edge of year of austerity and the cost of living crisis nationally million people be now live in poverty million be child and million be live in destitution be sure everybody in this house would agree that those figure be unacceptable child poverty be completely avoidable in the sixth rich country in the world not tackle it store up problem for the future cost our economy billion per year accord to calculation by the child poverty action group it be not question of whether we can afford to adopt vital policy to alleviate child poverty such as lift the two child cap it be question of whether we can afford not to this be the reason table amendment to the king speech with focus on debate not division to push for clear timetable for scrap the two child cap the end child poverty coalition believe this to be the most effective way to immediately lift child out of poverty there be support for this position from right across the political spectrum and it be something that the labour leadership have indicate that it will do as soon as financially viable but there be pocket of money that can be find if we look hard enough gordon brown have suggest that between billion and billion can be find by impose reserve requirement on bank similar to those that the european central bank and the swiss bank currently have and that million can be find by simplify the gift aid system economist believe the recent upturn in the economy mean that the new government could begin to consider bring forward priority policy such as scrap this cap other would argue that progressive taxation should also be strongly consider the late department for work and pensions datum show that two third of family impact by the two child cap have at least one parent in full time work the last labour government have big and bold ambition in to end child poverty within generation as single work mum of twin personally benefit from those transformative policy without the availability of after school and holiday provision would not have be able to continue work know we have inherit the bad financial situation since the second world war and that labour in government be go to have some very careful choice to make about the path forward we have massive mountain to climb but we be elect with massive majority the country have vote for change remove the two child cap would send powerful message of hope to those who have put their trust in labour government to bring about the change we so desperately need the one in two child live in poverty in my constituency have know nothing but the tyranny of tory government hunger and hardship during their short life those child can not and must not wait any long to be lift out of poverty as mention early the purpose of my amendment be to debate this very important issue not to cause division and there have be lot of debate this week but we need action this punitive policy need to be consign to the dustbin of history where it belong and in its

current account deficit we end up with less control over our economy and more expose to global risk and shock from low pay to regional inequality poor productivity to the funding of public service all the thing we worry about be symptom of this wide problem we need to question economic theory challenge treasury orthodoxy and think beyond the intellectual limit of ideological liberalism theory like comparative advantage have lead we to offshore industry and grow dependent on hostile state like china but international trade be neither free nor fair and net zero can not mean sacrifice our

constituency cross the county of surrey and hampshire make the life of new member of parliament even more complex than it already be more than that the name while reference the two large town in each county ignore the other town of haslemere and liphook and the many village that range between the large population centre many argue for and support less specific but more all encompass name for the constituency such as the wey valley take its name from the beautiful river wey that run through it clearly they be not romantic in the boundary commission so farnham and bordon stick the only save grace be that its initial spell fab which sum up the area that represent this fab constituency range from farnham in the north to haslemere and liphook in the south whitehill and bordon in the west and the western village of surrey such as tilford in the east bookende by the north and south down it be an area of outstanding beauty with thrive market town pleasant village and thrive sport and art scene include the prestigious university for the creative arts it also have significant military connection most obviously in bordon which be home to the royal electrical and mechanical engineers until and be home to the longmoor range where ukrainian troop be be train military history be everywhere from amesbury school in haslemere and hindhead where montgomery live during the war to the canadian war graf and memorial in liphook and the site of the first ever two minute silence in this country on castle street in farnham the resident of this new constituency be ever thankful for the role that our armed force have play in keep we safe from arthur conan doyle to jonny wilkinson king john to flora thompson and graham thorpe to the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice hero and villain have be bear live work and play in this fabulous constituency but it be not the beautiful scenery the historic gem or the famous people who make this constituency the good in the country it be not even the fact that my grandparent run stafford sweet shop in haslemere for many year what little boy would not want grandparent who run sweet shop it be the current resident business and community spirit that make fab special and joy to represent every day there be local event charitable occasion and community festivity to get involve with indeed doubt that anywhere else in this country can rival the number of duck race in the area follow that cook tour of the constituency one might be forgive for think that there be no issue to solve home county garden of eden it of course can not be deny that there be many area of significant affluence but it should not be conceal that there be area of high deprivation and will champion their improvement the constituency location be both benefit and curse within easy commuting distance of london it provide rural haven for those who wish to live outside but work in the city that also make it rich picking for housing developer who look for any open space green or otherwise to build on be not against housing development we need home for our child and grandchild but we need the right home in the right place with the right tenure mix and with the support infrastructure conservative run east hampshire district council have do everything that it can to persuade the new government to modify their housing target to make they more appropriate for our area include write to the deputy prime minister hope that she will respond positively indeed if there be one issue that unite the whole of the new farnham and bordon constituency it be that infrastructure have not keep pace with development that be particularly acute in bordon where thousand of house be go up without the support infrastructure the gp surgery the nhs dentist the school the road and the leisure centre all need upgrade and expand rapidly to meet that housing growth we must not build more house until infrastructure catch up otherwise we will be leave with housing estate devoid of service security and society be deeply concerned about the new government plan on house building labour change to planning impose top down target and remove the right of local people to have their say on development be retrograde step that have be meet with anger from my constituent and resolute opposition from mention the need for health service in our area have spend most of my career in healthcare latterly work for seven year in the nhs improve clinical service and patient outcome know that both locally and nationally thing need to change in the nhs we need to have grow up and honest discussion with the public about how we be go to deliver provide and fund the nhs and social care go forwards for an age population with increase healthcare need and diminish birth rate that is the people who be go to pay for the nhs we need cross party discussion that bring all party together to make long term decision on how we proceed with health and social care in this country if achieve nothing else in my time here start that conversation and hopefully progress it fruitfully will be something to hope for as traditional common sense conservative believe that we can not pay for health and social care unless we have strong economy despite global pandemic war in the east of europe and instability in the middle east and regardless of the picture that the government be try to paint in their press release the most recent statistic show that the economy be turn around and be on an upward trajectory will oppose any measure by this government include the misguided nationalisation of industry and the socialist labour rule that believe will hamper or reverse that trend equally important be to safeguard ourselves from external threat the rise of resurgent russia china and north korea be something that we should all be concern about do not believe that it be hyperbole to say that we be in pre war era and we need to ensure that our border sky and infrastructure both physical and digital be safe from threat that be why absolutely believe that we should move to of gdp spend on defence immediately and increase that to when practical in short we must protect our economy healthcare and national security to ensure the prosperity and safety of our country but mindful that maiden speech be not mean to be controversial shall leave it there and return briefly to the subject of my fab constituency in samuel pepys record that the people of liphook be good honest people give his own moral and motivation be not sure whether he mean that as compliment but assure

approach this new parliament with renew commitment to respectful debate and disagreement election be time to make choice now that decision have be make it be time to move forward with relentless focus on public service and delivery thank you mr deputy speaker for kindly call to contribute to this important debate on the king speech after very good maiden speech and very promising even fabulous start to parliamentary career those who have be in this house little long will know that our great friend the late sir david amess whose plaque now rightfully hang on the wall have great talent for manage to combine very large number of topic into one speech lack sir david skill so will seek to confine my remark this evening to three topic all development relate the first topic relate to an expansion in medical capacity for the nhs and specifically to proposal to expand the jones family practice in hockley declare an interest my wife olivia have work in the nhs for nearly year in essence the plan be to expand the practice with first floor extension to create eight new gp consulting room and additional training facility rochford district council recently approve planning permission for the extension and the senior partner professor dr mahmud and his active practice management team be now seek approval from local nhs boss to support the scheme it be my intention as the recently re elect local mp for which be very grateful to my constituent to lend weight to these positive proposal they be design not just to expand capacity but hopefully to provide training place for graduate from the new medical school at anglia ruskin university in chelmsford for the record have also be work for some time to try to expand riverside medical centre in hullbridge and will be pursue that with the nhs as well secondly the town of wickford have suffer dearth of supermarket capacity in recent year my constituent endure something of perfect storm last year when the aldi supermarket be close while at the same time the old co op nearby have effectively stand semi derelict for three year during that supermarket vacuum my constituent be force to fall back on the small iceland in the high street and wickford market be very pleased to reopen the enlarge aldi last autumn and it be now do brisk trade however the co op still remain undeveloped and while board up be occupy valuable space in the town principal car park it be long and complicated saga suffice it to say that the site be buy several year ago by development company name heriot which originally come up with plan in conjunction with the supermarket chain morrison to redevelop the store with an underground car park and some flat above always have doubt about the commercial viability of those proposal especially the underground car park and the scheme collapse some month ago nevertheless heriot be work on what might be call plan and for some month have be in what it describe as advanced talk with another major supermarket chain for commercial reason heriot ask not to name the supermarket in this speech something have agree to respect although have to say that the name of the company in question be now effectively an open secret and be even be report back to on doorstep by my wickford constituent during the general election speak to the director of heriot in advance of this debate who assure they be seek to bring their commercial negotiation to conclusion as soon as possible they be well aware of my frustration at these three year of delay which convey to they again this morning and they have ask to relate that they realise that my wickford constituent have already wait long while for new supermarket that be an issue campaign on heavily at the general election so hope heriot will be able to announce something definitive this summer my message to heriot be simple you have have more than enough time get on with it finally over two decade have see example of both good and bad development in my constituency young people can not live at home with their parent into their and so it must be possible to build some house in sustainable manner to meet the housing need crucially however the infrastructure require to accompany they have to be build first to put it another way from long experience if development be to be successful and it can be as say early it have to be do with people rather than to people the proposal at place call dollymans farm in my constituency which be re elect with mandate to oppose be precisely the opposite of that we all want to find somewhere suitable and appropriate for people to live but we have to do that in the right way it be an honour to be re elect for the fourth time to the redrawn seat of brentford and isleworth and to follow such impressive maiden speech particularly that of my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake in whose constituency we all work after nine year sit in opposition it be pleasure to be on the government side of the chamber and to support this government legislative programme which bring hope opportunity and change for my constituent and for the country at last will focus my response to the king speech on the government ambitious proposal around transport policy not only because it be an area have long be involve with have serve on the transport committee for five year and chair five all party parliamentary group on transport but because transport be bring up regularly on the doorstep in this last election the theme of today debate be economy welfare and public service effective transport policy be essential to the change we need to see in all three area as well as in address our climate crisis so be pleased to see the bold and ambitious plan set out by my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh and her team to do just that for access to work education and health service for supply our manufacturing and retail sector and for support our wellbeing and family life decent transport choice be essential and nowhere be they more need than in the new community that will be build if the traffic on the road to and around they be not to grind to halt whether in city town or countryside we need the full range of transport option one that be affordable accessible efficient and environmentally sound on bus be delighted that through the well bus bill the government will end the ideological and control freakery policy of ban local authority from run their own municipal bus company such company be kill off by the thatcher government in bout of ideological rage with only london retain regulated bus service the rest of england should have what we have in london regular day evening and weekend service simple fare structure and high standard of safety accessibility and passenger information those be be develop by the mayor of greater manchester andy burnham and look forward to see other local authority of all party be sure follow his example to be an alternative to drive and for we to cut road congestion and pollution rail travel must be reliable be therefore delighted to see bills to create great british railways and to bring train operation into public ownership that be essential for simplified and unified rail system that focus on improve passenger service while get value for the taxpayer our constituent and many member of this house have have terrible experience of cancel train or of sit on the floor for hour despite book seat we will now see government and department that do not use transport as cudgel in our culture war or as crude electoral hammer to override local authority that want to introduce sensible measure to encourage cycling and walking transport be at the heart of the challenge of national renewal that we have set ourselves kickstarte economic growth boost job and living standard and build sufficient home in sustainable community of course there be challenge ahead not least in far grow capacity in our overloaded rail network welcome the plan to improve east west connectivity across the north of england but fund further increase in rail capacity will unfortunately be financially unsustainable until we see the economic growth that the chancellor be work on aviation expansion be acceptable only if it pass the four test that we set ourselves in opposition cut carbon dioxide

they be under no illusion about the hard work that be require to be put in for their constituent and the people who live in their area congratulation to all of they also congratulate the chancellor on be the first female chancellor as the first woman in this place ever to lead on the economy although have be follow by number since be incredibly glad to see one on the government benches hope that as she say her tenure last significantly long than those of some of the chancellors we have see in recent time today debate be tagline economy welfare and public service apart from the maiden speech speech focus on anything other than economic growth have be fairly few and far between will not for one second deny that economic growth be important but the whole point of it be what we then do with it it be about what we do with the extra tax take generate from the growth we have create there be no point in have growth for growth sake there be no point in have economic growth and no point in the conservatives say how fast the uk be grow compare with other country in the if the same handful of people be get rich and rich and the vast majority of our constituent be struggle hard than they ever have before we need to ensure that the economic growth and the increase in the tax take that the labour party be hop to deliver involve benefit for all those who live in these island and in our constituency it be massively disappointing to hear that the five pledge and priority for the labour party in government do not have eradicate child poverty at the heart of they be really glad the government be bring together discussion taskforce to reduce child poverty but today they could bring child out of poverty and move child into less deep poverty simply by scrap the two child cap one of my previous colleague in this place alison thewliss campaign incredibly hard on the rape clause everybody will know of the work she do on that there be woman across these island who be eligible for an exemption from the cap because they have apply under the rape clause they have have to tell the government they be rap in order to get an uplift in their benefit that be horrific and even if the government be unwilling to move on the two child cap they should be do something about the rape clause and what people be have to prove in order to get the exemption it would be very easy to increase growth again overnight by increase migration migration to these island increase the amount of growth the economy would immediately have grow if the prime minister have go to the summit with the eu leader this week and say yes free movement benefit we it benefit our economy benefit our society benefit our young people benefit our musician and benefit so many different group and individual it benefit our culture it make this place well place to live therefore we be sign up again to free movement we need only look at some of the past budgets such as budget george osborne give from the dispatch box when it have say in the red book that increase migration will increase the tax take because of the economic growth it will bring my constituent and people across scotland recognise that and we will always argue for well migration policy and if the government be not willing to do it for all of these island we will argue for one tailor specifically to scotland so that we can make our own decision that suit the need of our community and encourage that economic growth it be pleasure to speak in support of the king speech under government commit to put country before party to improve life in this country that be what pledge to the people of bedford and kempston whom thank for put their faith in again to work hard for they and to restore their faith in politic as force for positive change the last government reduce our public service to shadow of their former self in study jointly fund by bedford borough council and the nhs find that bedford borough be under provide for in the primary care estate despite rapid growth in population since hmp bedford have be in and out of special measure so be pleased that the government have already take action to improve the crisis in prison be also pleased to see early priority give to strengthen community police by increase number of officer and give they great power to deal with the antisocial behaviour that blight our community hope this government succeed where the last government fail in implement fairer funding formula for bedfordshire police wrongly fund as rural force it be one of the lowest fund force in the uk despite million year on year increase to million for the housing crisis be cause untold misery to many of my constituent so be pleased that building house will be priority for our government it be indefensible that know of parent who be begin the summer holiday live in hotel room without access even to fridge or microwave to prepare food for their child because no suitable social housing property be available even food bank voucher be not help when basic staple such as uht milk can not be keep fresh once open more than child and adult be on waiting list for mental health treatment in the area cover by the nhs bedfordshire luton and milton keynes integrate care board for year the nhs provider have have the capital fund to bring in desperately need in patient mental health facility but the previous government consistently refuse to provide the capital expenditure cover so that we could have those facility in bedford hope the new government plan to get the nhs back on its foot include an overhaul of how new project be fund because the exist capital departmental expenditure limit be not work many of my constituent will be very happy to see planned legislation to bring rail back into public ownership and to reform bus service and franchise include by allow local control and support public ownership but one of the most significant transport issue in my constituency be east west rail bedford be uniquely adversely impact by the east west rail project because the preferred six track route require the demolition and blighting of home resident have be in limbo for more than five year in unsellable home the propose planning and infrastructure bill will speed up planning decision for major infrastructure and house building and seek to reform compulsory purchase compensation rule to ensure that the compensation pay to landowner be fair the statutory consultation stage be imminent and hope the government will listen to the concern express by my constituent and will not leave people in limbo while decision be make without their knowledge as have happen before if we want to restore faith in politic we have to ensure that our community come with we on plan to affect their life the universal studios plan to build park near kempston be exciting and look forward to work with the government to make sure we get this potentially huge investment opportunity for bedford and britain over the line start by wish his majesty the very good of health on behalf of myself and my constituent as we welcome many new member to the house his majesty set clear standard for public service that we can all hope to emulate have have the privilege of listen to number of maiden speech from across the house all fantastic all unique be sure all new member will have receive countless piece of advice so will just say this none of we new or return member should ever forget what privilege it be to serve in this house and in this parliament the mother of all parliaments we on the conservative benches have much to be proud of in the legacy of the last year just last week we have see inflation remain at the bank of england target rate of we create more than job day for the last year it be under the conservative government that in the uk become the third most valuable tech economy in the world worth trillion we also boast more billion pound company than france germany and sweden combine as have be repeatedly mention we have the fast grow economy in the want to address the notion that the government be try to push where they talk down the economy pave the way for tax rise it clearly do not stack up if the chancellor insist on push this alternative narrative as we have hear today some question need answering because surely all those promise make during the election can not have be make by the chancellor or the shadow chancellor as she be then fly blind especially when the obr provide the transparency that she now deny she have throughout the campaign we hear about how the government policy be fully fund if the chancellor do not use the obr forecast what be she use to make those promise in the first place do not think anyone be fool by this narrative or these tactic most importantly if they be go to raise taxis which will they raise they need to come clean about that because the british people deserve the truth not whatever the government be try to peddle to justify their tax and spend policy the government can be assure that the opposition will do our duty and hold this government to account want to address number of thing in the king speech have to say be astonish by the lack of respect in the king speech to rural community lot of my community in my rural area feel incredibly disrespect and it be incredibly disappointing be also disappointed and deeply concerned by the government focus on build on the green belt we have some of the most precious green belt land in meriden and solihull east not least the meriden gap which be hugely important throughway for migrate wildlife it be not clear how the government will protect the meriden gap in fact the only thing that have be clear in the early day of this government be that they be willing to set aside local community opinion and anyone who challenge that will be accuse of be nimby my village in balsall common hampton in arden marston green knowle dorridge chadwick end and hockley heath have already make huge sacrifice when it come to green belt land not least because of these top down target and vague reference to grey belt land be already cause huge anxiety this matter because when it come to set aside community opinion and disenfranchise whole community the tactic that the government be already employ be the good way to do it be deeply concerned by that we on the opposition benches will ensure that we hold this government to account the title of this debate include public service and one of my key campaign pledge be to restore service to the borough of solihull my argument on that be simple we have about people in the borough and if there be an emergency my constituent have to go all the way to heartlands hospital or warwick hospital which be way too far away it be clear to that the case be strong one thing will be campaign for in this parliament whether it take five or or year if be lucky enough to be return repeatedly make no assumption on that of course will be to get that service will be work with the integrate care board to achieve that will finish on this my constituent and the british people have be clear as we discharge our duty as his majesty official opposition their expectation be that we do so with integrity and humility but always with courage and boldness in what we stand for and who we be assure my constituent that for the sake of our country we shall not falter call kate dearden to make her maiden speech mr deputy speaker thank you for allow to make my first contribution to this house

of the labour movement policy to help protect the right to strike to enhance the right to flexible working and to end fire and rehire we also have policy that echo some of the great achievement of previous labour governments which recognise the value of own and running service and infrastructure for the common good the failure of previous conservative government to combat the climate crisis should terrify we all we have so much catch up to do if we be to avert the chaos it threaten so welcome our government plan to speed up the transition to renewable through publicly own clean energy company and with bill to bring rail service back into public ownership hope to see far less regularly those chilling word rail replacement bus service be also relieve to see the return of some policy

durham and its people and the wide north east order apologise to any back benchers who have not be able to get in but be afraid we now have to move to the wind up and call the liberal democrat spokesperson congratulate the hon member for north durham luke akehurst on an excellent maiden speech that highlight the value of equality and fairness principle that many of we can agree on and on demonstrate his stamina by be the last member to be call with that level of stamina be sure that he will give the hon member for strangford jim shannon run for his money it be an honour to sum up for the liberal democrats once again extend warm welcome to new ministers and to our country first female chancellor also congratulate new member from all party who give their maiden speech today their speech do not disappoint they be poignant funny and burst with passion when give my maiden speech in be very proud to say that st albans have more pub per square mile than anywhere else in britain and today maiden speech have give we enough historical nugget for maiden speech pub quiz maybe will write it on the train journey home be pleased that the topic of economy welfare and public service have be bring together why well during the general election the liberal democrats put health and care front and centre of our campaign and we do so for two reason first it be the no issue that constituent raise with we on the doorstep every single person be impact by the crisis in health and social care secondly we know that health creation and wealth creation be two side of the same coin we can not have thriving economy if our population be sick we liberal democrats set out an ambitious agenda during the general election and we be pleased about some of the pledge in the king speech we be pleased that there will be reform of the mental health act which be incredibly long overdue and number of other public health measure especially on the protection of child health however we in this house all know that it be equally important to tackle the social and commercial determinant of health and tackle child poverty be just as important as tackle the aggressive marketing of vape and energy drink that be why scrap the two child benefit limit be in our liberal democrat amendment it be also important that we focus on access to health and social care service people must be able to access the care that they need when they need it that be where the liberal democrats want to see more ambition we need to fix our crumble hospital we need mental health hub in community we need to boost our gp number we need to guarantee that people have legal right to see their gp within seven day and we need to put an end to dental desert we all know someone who have have cancer and die or someone who have have cancer and survive but in every single year from the conservative government miss their cancer treatment target we can not allow that to continue that be why we liberal democrats want there to be legal right through statutory duty on ministers for this house and the public to hold ministers to account on ensure that people can see gp and get their cancer treatment when they need it we liberal democrats will also be unapologetic and unrelenting in our focus on social care we have campaign for free personal care and we will continue to do so free personal care be good for people independence and dignity and for the nhs it would also enable the many million of unpaid carer who currently pick up the piece of broken social care system to up their hour do more work return to work and boost our economy health creation and wealth creation be two side of the same coin we look forward to see the government employment right bill with interest we liberal democrats have campaign for improved pay for care worker include by propose high minimum wage start at more but that have to come with improved investment so that local government no long have to rob peter to pay paul we can no long suppress the pay of experienced care worker to fund improved pay for new starter we must stop rip the heart out of retention strategy just to tackle recruitment we have to do both the king speech be also an opportunity to go far on care it be an opportunity to introduce pay carer leave make care protect characteristic create royal college of care worker introduce measure to tackle to scandal of carer allowance overpayment and put in place framework for cross party talk that would finally put social care on firm financial footing for the future recognise that the king speech be an opportunity for the government to set out their priority but hope very much that many of these idea particularly for fix social care may be announce in due course as our party leader my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey have say the liberal democrats will continue to be the voice of carer in this parliament if we want to boost the economy we have to recognise that there be now several stage to people life and career there have to be lifelong learning upskille and reskille from cradle to grave but we still have to make sure that every child have the good start in life at the moment under the current system many child particularly those with special educational need and disability be put at big disadvantage from the get go and huge part of that be send funding as one quick example my area of hertfordshire be one of the poorest fund education authority for send under the conservatives funding formula it would take year for child in hertfordshire to catch up with those in neighbouring buckinghamshire itself one of the poorest fund education authority that be an entire generation of lose young child and lose education because of government spreadsheet formula it be just another unforgivable legacy of the conservative government and implore the labour government to look at this issue with fresh eye and real urgency another engine of our economy be small business and high street many speaker this afternoon include many people give their maiden speech have talk about the high street and local business that be the glue that hold our community together would like to push the government to go far particularly on reform business rate some people may remember that in the aftermath of the mini budget the ex chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt have spend the summer campaigning for complete overhaul of the business rate system on his first day in the job challenge he on whether he would in fact review that system he give wry smile from across the chamber and say that he regret campaign so hard for it from the back benches that review be leave in the too hard basket it be part of long list of challenge face the labour government unfortunately with similar refrain but implore labour ministers not to do the same sit in their in tray will be the result of the high street taskforce which be sure will confirm what we already know that the business rate system be break crippling high street particularly heritage pub while amazon warehouse be be give tax break that system be not the foundation of fair economy to conclude there be measure in the king speech that we welcome but we want to see far great ambition for our high street our child and our public service particularly health and social care we believe that our amendment to the address go some way towards address those thing and we urge member to support it call the shadow secretary of state for work and pensions congratulate everybody who have make their maiden speech in this debate it be big moment in one parliamentary career but you be out the other side and nothing will be quite as traumatic as what you have experience today to go through

of they which show that he be wise man and will go far the hon member for hartlepool mr brash stress the industrial and shipping heritage of his constituency and how it be indeed bombard by the

notice on horseplay as such the hon member for newton aycliffe and spennymoor alan strickland focus with great pride on the hitachi rail company in his constituency shortly be afraid to tell he to be seize by the labour party and nationalise as part of its government programme my hon friend the member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford stress defence spending the hon member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake leasehold reform and the hon member for south antrim robin swann the importance of agriculture be out of the chamber for the speech of the hon member for didcot and

pride his dad would have have in the fact that he have be successful in his fourth attempt to join we here in the house of commons the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins reference the fact that roman road watle street run through her constituency and speak passionately about the importance of community and tolerance finally the hon member for north durham luke akehurst speak warmly of kevan jones whom all of we who have be in this house for while remember with great fondness and the importance of skilled and well pay job in his constituency hope that have pretty much covered everybody and say the main thing that need say let we now turn to the debate itself and it seem to that the right hon member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves while congratulate she warmly on be the first female chancellor think that be huge achievement and be to be very warmly welcome be be afraid suffer from some level of amnesia she appear to have forget the legacy that we have bequeath to she inflation which be up at over last autumn be now back to target mortgage rate be soften real wage have be grow in each of the last month and taxis have be come down more recently under the previous government when it come to debt we be on target as we hand over to the right hon lady to see debt fall in line with her own fiscal target at the end of the fifth year and we of course have the fast grow economy in the one wonder where this amnesia be come from and it be of course nothing more than smoke and mirror it be to cover up the fact that the chancellor be roll the pitch to raise taxis against all the commitment she make during the general election she will be raise those taxis in the autumn it will not be because we have bequeath she something of which she be not aware in advance the ifs have make it very clear that the book be open as paul johnson say for all to see when it come to public service we have proud record on education we have the good reader in the western world we have be go up the pisa scale for mathematic and science something that do not happen under the last labour government crime have be halve broadly speak across the period from to the present day when it come to work and welfare we have near record level of employment and we have low level of unemployment and economic inactivity be low than in every single year under the last labour government what be labour record when they leave office unemployment be double the level that it be today under every single labour government in history unemployment have be high when they leave office than when they come in most disgraceful of all be that youth unemployment be up under the last labour government under the last conservative government it be down by over as for welfare under labour there be million people languish on long term benefit for almost decade on pension we see the pension increase and the gordon brown raid on private pension of billion from which the pension system never fully recover it be therefore no surprise that under labour we end up with the fourth high level of pensioner poverty across europe under labour there be million more people in absolute poverty after housing cost there be more pensioner in poverty and more child in poverty under the last labour government than there be today we will be responsible opposition we welcome the commitment to growth in the king speech we welcome the commitment to build house as long as that be with sufficient local consent we welcome the budget responsibility bill in principle and we welcome the announcement that the chancellor have make regard pension consolidate pension and ensure that we get well return for pensioner and that we invest in long term pension capital but there be too many echo in this king speech of the labour of old the nationalisation of the railway the consolidation of gb energy the long hand of government member hear hear labour members cheer now but they will be cheer in few year time they have short memory remember when the railway be nationalise and it be not pretty situation they be bring forward french style employment law that will lead to less efficient business and to tribunal they will be increase the freedom of trade union who be their paymaster and they will be dispense with minimum service level that will lead to more strike and the inconvenience of the public but certainly not great growth what have we hear in the king speech on welfare one of the big challenge of the modern age zip absolutely nothing nada diddly squat absolutely nothing from the labour party they talk about move the national careers service from the department for education to the department for work and pensions well hardly think that will move the dial their back to work plan be name exactly as our back to work plan be that my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt the shadow chancellor and launch last autumn but it have nothing stand behind it not the billion of pound of support we put in place to encourage people to go into work and to transform life all we have hear from those on the government benches be denigration of our job centre these be describe as place of fear by the secretary of state for work and pensions and by the minister for employment the hon member for birkenhead alison mcgovern as place that do not offer real help what an insult to the ten of thousand of hard work people up and down our country who go into those office to help people improve their prospect and improve their life they be against what they call punitive sanction it will cost hundred of million of pound to remove those and it will result in less engagement with the help that be available and diminish people life chance there have be no comment whatsoever from the government benches on our work capability assessment reform that accord to the office for budget responsibility will see few people on long term sickness benefit they oppose in poetry they have to govern in prose they have not even pick up the pen but let be clear we make mistake in government and we have pay the price at the ballot box and it be right that my party now face period of reflection and do so with humility the electorate have speak and we must listen but that be not the same as say that the vision that be conservatism have die even if of late it have be too often obscure that vision still burn bright it burn bright as beacon of freedom enterprise opportunity and yes stability and hope in the face of order will the shadow secretary of state please curtail his remark now commend our amendment to the house have never see the right hon member for central devon mel stride do comic turn quite like that opposition clearly suit he but if he want to lead his party out of its catastrophic defeat he will have to do lot well be honour to close today debate not only as be speak from this side of the dispatch box for the first time but after so many truly wonderful maiden speech member from all part of the house talk about the social cultural and economic heritage of their constituency and about the real challenge that their constituent face but also their talent and potential for bright future give that they have government who be on their side there be too many member to go through individually especially on the government benches but let just say this your constituent will be very proud of you as will your friend and family say that especially to the hon member for north down alex easton member have speak with passion and conviction especially on the government benches about the need for change and to make true on our manifesto promise and that be what this government will deliver this king speech turn the page on the last year of chaos and decline and it take the first step towards national renewal deliver growth in every part of the country tear down the barrier to opportunity and repair our public service through investment and reform growth be this government no priority because it be the only way that we will improve prosperity put more money into people pocket and transform our public service our plan start with economic stability through the fiscal lock and our budget responsibility bill so that we never again repeat the mistake of the last conservative government who crash the economy leave work people to pay heavy price our planning and infrastructure bill will get britain build again to deliver the home and other infrastructure that our country need our national wealth fund will unlock billion of pound of private investment to support good job in clean energy and other growth industry of the future the department be now privileged to lead be central to our growth and opportunity mission through unlock the potential of our pension system get people into work and on in their work and drive down poverty in every part of the country first on pension people who have work hard and save all their life deserve decent income in retirement although the previous government talk about the need for pension reform in reality there be little action in contrast we have act immediately our new pension bill will bring together all the different pension saving that people build up across their work life and drive well value for money in pension scheme these measure could help improve income in retirement and boost pension pot by more than our landmark pension review announce by my right hon friend the chancellor and lead by the minister for pensions my hon friend the member for wycombe emma reynolds will go even far in unlock investment in british business and improve outcome for british pensioner the second way we will boost growth and unleash opportunity be by get britain work again last week labour market statistic underline the truly dire inheritance we face britain be the only country whose employment rate have not return to pre pandemic level some million people be now economically inactive either not in work or not look for work that be one in five of the entire working age population of those people million be lock out of the workplace due to poor health that include often woman with bad hip knee and joint know about that only too well and young people with mental health problem often lack basic qualification one in eight of all our young people be not in education employment or training what damn indictment of the last government but behind those statistic be real people with real hope and dream who be write off by the tories deny opportunity and support and then blame for the position they be in let tell the house now that under the new labour government that will change our plan to get britain work will be cross government effort to drive change and unleash opportunity in every corner of the country we will create more good job in clean energy and through our modern industrial strategy we will make work pay and improve the quality of work through our new deal for work people we will cut nhs waiting time improve mental health support and transform skill and childcare to tackle the root cause of the problem and fix the foundation for work not just paper over the crack we will deliver fundamental change in the department for work and pensions too first we will overhaul jobcentre bring together jobcentre plus with the national careers service to create new job and career service to help more people get to work and get on in their work secondly we will drive down economic inactivity through new local work health and skill plan lead by mayor and local area devolve responsibility and resource to provide the right support in one place because the man or even the woman in whitehall will never know what be good in leicester lowestoft or leeds we will also deliver our youth guarantee to ensure that every young person be earn or learn because unlike conservative members we will never accept almost million young people be write off before they have even begin under this government there will be obligation to engage with support look for work and take job when they be offer as there always have be since the original beveridge report but there will be no more divisive derogatory rhetoric or claim that people just think that they be too bluesy to work be in politic to solve problem not to score cheap point and grab empty headline that do nothing to tackle the problem in people life alongside our plan to get britain work again we have take immediate action to deliver our manifesto commitment for an ambitious strategy to tackle child poverty be proud that the last labour government lift more than half million child out of poverty the contrast with the conservatives could not be great with more child grow up poor during their time in office the fact that million child be now live in poverty be stain on our society that be why within week of take office call in child poverty expert and campaigner to help start work on our plan it be why the prime minister announce our new ministerial taskforce to drive action across government underpin by new child poverty unit in the cabinet office will lead that work with our education secretary as the prime minister announce we will look at how to use all the lever at our disposal include household income employment housing child health education and childcare so that we drive up opportunity drive down poverty and give all child the good start in life the government be elect on mandate for change to change our economy so that it work for work people to get our public service back on their foot and to transform opportunity by tear down the barrier to success in every corner of this great nation the king speech take the first step to rebuild britain and make every part of our country well off deliver real change to people life give they the chance and choice they deserve and to begin finally the task

invest ni have highlight this say northern ireland aerospace defence offer true turnkey supply solution with design manufacture certification and testing in one hub the level of proximity and cohesion be firm within hour drive of each other high density of supplier across all element of the aerospace supply chain from design and manufacture world lead capability in machining composite polymer to coating assembly certification testing our high performing and consistently reliable supply chain can meet customer need at pace and with industry lead quality performance these company be engage at the leading edge of advanced aerospace design and manufacturing every major commercial aircraft programme depend on structure component and expert service from northern ireland world class university and an extensive network of further education college provide excellent academic and vocational training be my hon friend please that northern ireland have ten of thousand of job in the industry we be major exporter as result of the aerospace industry and when people fly around the world third of the seat on aircraft be make in northern ireland that be an amazing figure show how important the

government involvement and support to ensure that happen spirit announce on july that it have sign definitive merger agreement under which boeing will acquire spirit spirit have also enter into bind term sheet with airbus under which airbus will assume ownership of certain airbus programme carry out by spirit that include the programme at our belfast site my hon friend make an important point not

the under secretary of state for northern ireland the hon member for putney fleur anderson and the secretary of state for northern ireland impress upon airbus that in assume responsibility for the wing facility it be take on grandfathere obligation that arise from northern ireland executive and national government commitment that lead to the construction of that facility airbus should be in no

give all those challenge it be only right that we support aerospace manufacturer in northern ireland and across the uk and the industrial strategy will be the cornerstone of that work we believe that the strategy will grow our share of the global aerospace manufacturing market unlock huge investment opportunity that will fuel research and development and create new high skilled high pay job across the economy include in aerospace the government will work in close partnership with the aerospace sector support clean growth and continue to develop joint government and industry strategy through the aerospace growth partnership sector council partnership that reach business and the research base in every part of the united kingdom be aware that the hon member for strangford debate be focus on

the uk and for its worker move back to aerospace as the hon gentleman say there be at least company in northern ireland supply to every major commercial aircraft programme boast expertise in everything from composite design and manufacturing to precision machining and more as he also say one third of global aircraft seat be make in northern ireland as of course be the advanced composite wing of the airbus aircraft it be the week of the farnborough international airshow and week in which we have announce over million for cutting edge new green aerospace technology so the hon gentleman debate have touch down with excellent timing particularly as recognise we need to cover this that there be of course concern about the expect change in ownership of the region large advanced manufacturer spirit aerosystems short brothers short brothers be well know for its award win advanced composite technology develop and deploy on the wing the innovative design and manufacturing technique receive recognition in from the royal academy of engineering the high honour award to an engineering project short employ people on the programme support by million through repayable funding partnership with the northern ireland executive and the previous labour government in the ability to manufacture complete wing in one facility be credit to those who work there that build on the legacy of more than year of northern ireland aerospace airbus be now work on ramp up production and announce in april this year that it would be increase the production rate per month to aircraft by with more than order to deliver and the likelihood of further order to follow this provide great certainty for the company its employee and the northern ireland economy on the acquisition of spirit and shorts boeing and airbus announce on july that they will acquire part of the spirit aerosystems global business boeing plan to take nearly all of spirit boeing face business mostly those part locate in the united states that sale be however subject to the sale of certain other spirit operation to airbus airbus and spirit have agree subject to final term that airbus will acquire the wing and mid fuselage these be build by short brothers at its wing production facility and its other northern ireland site spirit plan to sell its remain belfast operation the non airbus programme alongside its facility in prestwick to another company these advanced manufacturing site offer engineering centre of excellence with engineering back capability which spirit assure we will prove to be an attractive proposition for potential buyer commercial negotiation be continue as the party work through the detail of the acquisition and work towards finalise term with an expectation that the transaction will close in the government be work with the northern ireland executive to help to ensure the good outcome for short brothers and all its highly skilled and hard work staff we have keen interest in see that any acquisition include commitment to develop short brothers and its supply chain and provide the good possible opportunity for growth in northern ireland that be because the government have clear vision for the future of aerospace across the whole uk we be provide support for technology development for the next generation of aircraft and engine through the aerospace technology institute programme which provide collaborative funding to company base in northern ireland and the rest of the uk that include the isothermal variable volume infusion or ivi project that we announce early today at farnborough international airshow million project lead by short brothers to produce light more structurally efficient aerostructure enable the transition to new sustainable aircraft the government will also continue to work in partnership with the northern ireland executive on opportunity for growth and investment in summary the uk have vibrant and hugely pioneer aerospace sector it be central cog in our manufacture economy and will play hugely important global role in decarbonisation and net zero nurture some of the high skilled job and most advanced technology in the world uk aerospace company and their supply chain will be at the heart of our transformative industrial strategy and know the northern ireland aerospace sector will play pivotal role in the success of the uk sector as whole and in the growth and success of uk manufacturing and industry question put and agree to house adjourn
