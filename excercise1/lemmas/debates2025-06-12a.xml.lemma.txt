government decision be very sorry to hear the news from the hon lady constituency it be the case that more people be in work compare with this time last year and few people be economically inactive be rather surprised that she mention the national insurance hike because the leader of the opposition be on the radio this morning and be repeatedly ask to confirm whether that hike would be reverse she fail to do so and it seem to that the opposition be in opposition to themselves the minister seem to be in denial as former entrepreneur visit lot of business in my constituency and talk to they about their fear not single one have anything positive to say about the employment rights bill indeed they be concerned that it will reduce employment not increase it and it have be estimate that it will

feel most intensely by foundational sector like hospitality which necessitate an urgent review my question to the minister be simple where will his red line sit how many more job have to come off payroll before the department for business and trade will stand up to the treasury on this another million where be the line again it be interesting that those on the conservative front bench do not seem to be in agreement with their own leader any more about the national insurance hike will just point out some statistic to the hon member the international monetary fund have predict that growth will increase this year and the lloyds business barometer find that business confidence be up we be put money back into people pocket and invest in this country we be do thing that the conservatives

vital role in the life of our community have speak to local business owner especially in hospitality who be already feel the pressure follow the spending review the chief executive of ukhospitality say that the overwhelming challenge hold back hospitality from meet its potential be the current tax burden do the minister accept that unless action be take to ease the burden on high street business especially in hospitality the government risk undermine the very community they claim to support say gently to the hon lady that when she have the conversation that she say she have with business in her constituency be sure she point out the huge economic mess that this government inherit and the billion black hole in public finance that be why the chancellor of the exchequer have to make some very difficult decision in last year budget we have set out series of plan that will make genuine difference on our high street include new opportunity to persuade landlord to open up premise for rent we will set out further plan in the come small business strategy and our industrial strategy will also help to generate growth in high street and beyond the town of burntwood in my constituency have

for face to face banking in community and high street up and down the country we be commit to work with the bank to roll out banking hub by the end of this parliament but we also think that the post office can do more to help to improve access to banking service on the particular issue in his constituency if it would be helpful would be very happy to sit down and talk to he about what else he might be able to do to secure banking hub for his constituent call the shadow minister the retail jobs alliance be very clear in its warning that the government change to business rate will accelerate the decline of high street reduce footfall and create cycle of economic downturn that letter be also sign by the union of shop distributive and allied workers labour affiliate trade union once again the minister and the department for business and trade have choice will they stand up for high street retailer actual employer and even their own affiliate trade union or will they just go along with treasury diktat once upon time the conservatives support business rate reform to help the high street the hon gentleman now seem to be shift his party policy indeed time after time his government promise that they would reform business rate but one of the reason they lose the confidence of british business at the last election be because they do not act to reform business rate we have say that we will introduce permanently low business rate for retail hospitality and leisure the chancellor of the exchequer set out our initial thought on that in the budget in october and we will publish an update on where we be on that issue in the come month we support business rate reform but when labour own trade union say that its plan be not go to work ministers should really sit up and listen let turn to another issue affect our high street shoplifting which continue to devastate many high street retailer see that in my own constituency in high street in princes risborough wendover and great missenden how be the minister actively engage with the home office police and crime commissioner and police force to move shoplift up the agenda across the board just as my home force of thames valley have do with its disc scheme before he come back with police number let tell he that there be more police in thames valley than ever before let alone since just talk the talk on number be not enough what be he go to do proactively to make this issue go up the agenda think the hon gentleman in his own way be congratulate the government on increase police number in his constituency and he be certainly right to do so we have commit to an extra police officer over the course of this financial year and total of an extra by the end of this parliament we be also take action to end the immunity that his party introduce for shoplifter and take step to increase the power that the police have to take action when shoplifter and other be violent against retail staff support for small businesses what step he be take to support small business what step he be take to support small business what step he be take to support small business in great grimsby and cleethorpes constituency our small business strategy will be publish later this year and will set out our plan to champion entrepreneur improve access to finance and help small and medium sized enterprise to reach more market and adopt new technology as allude to early we be develop our plan for our new business growth service simplify access to support and advice for small business we be also tackle the challenge of late payment include the introduction of new fair payment code and upcoming legislation require large company to report annually on their payment performance in aylesbury town centre we have some fantastic business from darlington to the rockwood pub and nafees bakery they provide an amazing service to the community but with issue such as traffic parking and antisocial behaviour they can struggle to get customer into town and through their door congratulate the minister on the work he be do but can he tell we more about how his small business strategy will support our high street and town centre like aylesbury to thrive very much enjoy my visit to my hon friend constituency and the roundtable we have with some of the fantastic business there very much hope that conservative control buckinghamshire council will finally get its act together and sort out some of the traffic and parking issue she mention we will set out our plan to do more to help small business across the country include in aylesbury in our sme strategy one particular measure that we will be able to take action on be to improve access to finance for small business follow the chancellor of the exchequer significant increase in the capacity of the british business bank yesterday small business on our high street across my constituency from earl court road to queensway notting hill gate and portobello road be feed up of be blight by candy shop low grade souvenir shop harry potter shop and even barbershop with accusation of vat and business rate evasion and even link to money laundering and serious organise crime can the minister outline what step the department be take in conjunction with the minister responsible for high street his majesty revenue and customs and the national crime agency to crack down on these operation and create legitimate level playing field for our small business recognise that my hon friend have be very persistent on this issue and he be entirely right to be so we have be work with colleague in the home office and the national crime agency to take action to crack down on illegitimate business that threaten to undermine the legitimate one that exist on all of our high street in march the national economic crime centre co ordinate three week crackdown on barbershop and other cash intensive business where there be concern visit almost premise and secure freeze order over series of bank account total more than million thank the minister for his answer but really do need to press he because my constituent in great grimsby and cleethorpes be as feed up as those of my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell with see high street dominate by dodgy vape shop and unlicensed barber while some of those business be legitimate recent bbc investigative report show that many be involve in money laundering and organised crime obviously the minister be aware of the situation but be he work closely with the home office to try to tackle this blight we probably need national strategy not three week operation my hon friend be right to say that this be not just an issue for our high street such as those mention by our hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell but concern up and down the country the national crime agency and home office colleague be seek to take action against illegitimate business and my hon friend will

very good it would be bad day this week if do not mention the fantastic news of the knighthood of sir billy boston it be nice to be able to do that hope you will admire my restraint mr speaker in not mention your birthday and therefore not give any incentive to any other member of the house to mention it in their remark either have the dubious pleasure as you do mr speaker of listen to yesterday spend review in this chamber it bring to mind president abraham lincoln immortal line about manage to compress the great number of word into the small amount of content be afraid that the statement be somewhat bad than that it be in both its design and delivery an exercise in distraction and sleight of hand document not of economic strategy but of political evasion we should be clear from the outset that this be spending review not budget unlike budget it be not subject to scrutiny by the office for budget responsibility the chancellor figure have therefore not be externally verify her assumption have not be stress test and her projection have not be independently review she be not require to publish the full fiscal implication or to give the embarrassing number in her own remark and of course she do not even within the confine of departmental budget the presentation be be afraid somewhat disingenuous final year outside the actual spending review period be include fill with speculative figure design to suggest rigour and restraint in budgetary control this be the illusion of discipline without the reality of delivery in case any member be interested this be on page of the document elsewhere baseline figure be conveniently shift most comparison begin from the year not the current year which have the effect of inflate the apparent scale of any increase sizewell be classic example the document trumpet near increase in investment in truth spend over the period be fall by that be on page similarly on police funding the chancellor be very careful in her language to say that there would be an increase in police spending power but what she mean be that there would be an increase in the local authority precept in plain english tax rise the same obfuscation be at work with overseas development aid the chancellor have always say that oda cut be need to fund defence but the reality be that defence increase be almost entirely in capital spending while oda be cash line far from fund our national defence what have actually happen be that overseas development aid have be cut to prop up other departments day to day budget the most obvious case be defence spending we be tell in grand rhetoric that it would rise to and later of gdp at some undefined moment when fiscal circumstance allow in fact it be unlikely that even will be reach this parliament the quote include the single intelligence account which suggest that the number be below the defence investment plan the plan that will release the money be unlikely to appear until the end of the year that be nearly month after the general election this at time of war in ukraine and with china potentially position itself for conflict over taiwan by on monday nato secretary general mark rutte echo yesterday by no less than lord robertson say that unless nato member raise defence spending to with an additional in wide support we may as well start learn russian that be the strategic context the government response have be to dither and delay the chancellor turn over the winter fuel payment badly damage whatever credibility she ever have yesterday statement have compound the problem for she and the government no mention be make of the estimate annual council tax increase now expect as flag by paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies no admission be make that the review will add billion in new borrowing that be an extra billion year in interest payment at current rate by the end of the period meanwhile the suppose efficiency saving of nearly billion be widely regard as illusory as the chancellor herself say about the spending review these be her choice but the truth be plain there will be tax cut for the people of mauritius for the rest of we the spending review be gigantic speculative splurge of spending present via smoke and mirror which will end up as it always do with labour with high taxis and british taxpayer will have to bear the impact start by say that the thought of the whole house and the government will be with the family of those travel on flight from ahmedabad in india to london gatwick which have reportedly crash this be an unfold story and it will undoubtedly be cause huge amount of worry and concern to the many family and community here and those wait for the arrival of their love one we send our deep sympathy and thought to all those

treaty and protect marine life around the world we be all shock by sir david attenborough film about the destruction cause by bottom trawling which this government will ban in protect british water be really happy as ever to debate the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman on the economy he use to be treasury minister and he be well read he know be sure what every economist in this country know which be that for many many year the uk economy have be define by low growth and stagnant living standard because of our comparatively low productivity that be because we have have year and year of under investment in our infrastructure in our service in our region and in our people this labour government be finally put that right with year renewal plan to rebuild britain and address the productivity gap be not sure whether the conservatives really understand basic economic because they be show no sign of it in my part of the world and yours mr speaker that have be particularly true town and city across the north and the midland have be hold back by woeful transport infrastructure that would be unacceptable to people in the south hold back by the lack of job opportunity near where they live hold back by poor insecure and costly housing hold back because they be not get the training and skill they need and hold back because their life chance be low as result of deep seat inequality that can not be address overnight and we be not pretend that it will be but we have long term plan for renewal that include the big investment in affordable and social housing in year nuclear and renewable infrastructure transform community around the country the north finally get the rail connectivity it deserve and every community get well bus school and hospital be be rebuild for the century base not on fictional budget and economic but on actual plan to deliver they we be address today cost of living crisis too with our warm home plan to bring down bill by extend free school meal and free breakfast club with more free childcare with cap on bus fare and by increase the wage of the low pay with wage go up more in the first month of this labour government than they do in year of the conservative government finally we continue to boost the nhs which have already result in waiting list come down month after month the right hon gentleman want to talk about choice so let we talk about those choice we would not have be able to set those thing out if we have not make the difficult change to taxis that we make in the budget last year he seem to want more spending for the police and defence think that be what he be say but he do not want to make the hard decision about where the money will come from he mention yet again the of spending on defence which this government be deliver but he might want to remind himself of when defence spending reach in the last year be it in any of the year for which his government be in office no it be not it be only when labour be last in government that we reach the height of in contrast to the conservatives fantasy economic yesterday spending allocation be all within the envelope that we set out in the budget last year so we be really clear where the money be come from as ever their economic argument be utterly incoherent on the one hand they say that we be spend too much and on the other that we be not spend even more on police and defence they criticise we on growth yet they do not want the investment to turbocharge our productivity and therefore our growth we be the party with plan plan to renew britain plan to raise living standard in every part of the country plan to get our public service back on their foot and plan to give people the security they need in their home to follow on from what the leader of the house and the shadow leader of the house have say all our prayer and thought go to the family of the london bind aircraft that have crash let we hope there be well news to

which the absentee and irresponsible owner of the former junction pub be allow it to deteriorate it be now in dangerous condition and fear that somebody will be badly hurt the process of deal with dangerous structure be too long too bureaucratic and too cumbersome please may we have debate in government time think lot of members will have the same experience so we can share our experience and see whether the government can push thing forward my hon friend be right to raise the difficult issue of the junction pub in his constituency we all hear those story time and again we want to give local community more power to have the right to acquire such facility and for those power to be exercise more quickly than they currently be we be bring forward legislation in that regard but he might want to club together with other to get debate on the issue call the liberal democrat spokesperson may echo the thought and sympathy that have be send to all those involve in the air india crash that be be report know that many british citizen will be affect and our thought be with they recently join essex police on ride along in my chelmsford constituency to witness at first hand its vital work in our local community to keep we all safe worryingly essex police have regularly raise with that the national funding formula know as the police allocation formula be outdated and unfair the funding that essex police receive fall far short of the proportion of policing carry out by the force in national context yesterday spending review do nothing to change that or to remove concern about police funding overall indeed the chairman of the national police chiefs council say that in real term the increase in funding will cover little more than annual inflationary pay increase for officer and staff he add that the amount fall far short of what be require to maintain our exist workforce if we want to keep crime off our street and retain the experienced officer who do such vital work to keep we safe surely we must give they the funding to match yesterday spending review do not do that will the leader of the house therefore raise those issue with both the treasury and the home office thank the hon lady for express her thought on the india crash as well she raise an important issue about adequate police funding all our constituent want to see more police on the street and crime in their community come down this government be commit to more visible police on the street and to increase neighbourhood police number by yesterday spending review announce an above inflation increase in

access his right and the legal system that he certainly feel comfortable with which be ours he would be able to return to the united kingdom where no doubt the spanish would seek to extradite he and many in this house would be rather pleased notwithstanding the foreign secretary commitment to the sovereignty clause the question of sovereignty can only really be answer once we have the full detail of the treaty that scrutiny be make poor by the government decision when they take office to abolish the european scrutiny committee which do detailed work on this subject in the last parliament if

clarity be that there will no long be any check if they fly into spain they be fly into the schengen area if they fly into málaga they be free to drive to gibraltar without check they would already

review for the department of health and social care this government be elect on manifesto to fix our break nhs and make it fit for the future our job be twofold first to get the nhs back on its foot and treat patient on time again and secondly to reform the service for the long term so that it be fit for the future that be why in her autumn budget my right hon friend the chancellor take the necessary decision to give health and social care record uplift in day to day spending at the conclusion of the first phase of the spending review the department for health and social care receive

would not like to try your patience so will make this point briefly to govern be to choose and anyone who oppose the decision that the chancellor take in her budget must tell we what they would have subtract from that list we can not spend money if we do not raise it as the minister of state for secondary care regularly hear appalling anecdote from colleague across the house whose local hospital gp surgery and community service be crumble with rusty equipment leaky pipe and bucket catch rainwater phase of the spending review have allow we to arrest year of shocking neglect and undercapitalisation in the nhs with record capital investment of billion in interruption the conservatives do not like it but will go on that money have go towards repair our crumble hospital support

have make clear investment must come with reform this year we have unveil our plan for change our elective reform plan our urgent and emergency care plan and crackdown on agency spend in order to reinvest billion into the frontline yesterday my right hon friend the chancellor set out the conclusion of phase of the spending review set budget that will enable we to make firm plan to deliver on

represent more than real term increase by the end of the spending review period let hammer this point home investment must be match by reform this will be critical year for the nhs as we achieve well value for taxpayer who must see their money be spend well and deliver result we would rather take those difficult decision now to save our nhs so that it be there for future generation nhs england be top down organisation the big quango in the world with less efficient system than the previous government inherit in and twice the headcount at the centre that be why my right hon and learn friend the prime minister announce in march that we will bring together nhs england and the department of health and social care to form new joint centre that will put an end to duplication and enable substantial efficiency saving while bring the management of our nhs back under democratic control we will also unlock billion of saving over the spending review period through annual productivity growth in the nhs money that will be either reinveste in the frontline or use to support radical transformation to make the health system more agile and efficient our elective reform plan set out how we will ensure that by the end of this parliament of patient will not have to wait more than week for elective care this settlement will drive we far towards that goal with over billion of additional capital investment over five year across new diagnostic elective and emergency and urgent care capacity which could deliver more than million additional test and procedure we will build on the record capital investment from phase to repair the nhs estate that mean continue the delivery of new hospital invest billion in maintenance and repair with billion of it to address the most critical building repair and reduce by half the number of hospital contain raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete over this parliament this spending review provide for an increase of over billion for adult social care in compare with include an increase in the nhs contribution via the well care fund local authority with responsibility for adult social care will also benefit from wide reform to well align funding with need multi year settlement and simplification of the funding landscape that enable they to plan more effectively last but not least we have take step to simplify target and well monitor delivery and we will continue to work with local system to improve financial and operational performance to get the most from every penny key part of our year plan be drive progress on the three shift from analogue to digital hospital to community and treatment to prevention on digital we will invest up to billion in technology and transformation to start make the nhs app digital front door and deliver single patient record we will work in partnership with the wellcome trust to launch the world first health datum research service back by million to accelerate the discovery of lifesave drug

at least extra mental health staff by the end of this parliament and in mental health support team for every school within five year finally on prevention our world lead immunisation programme will be support by billion and we will invest million in tobacco cessation programme and our tobacco and vapes bill want to end by thank the chancellor for her unwavering commitment to get our nhs back on its foot fix break britain will not be easy but nothing that be worth do ever be today have set out how every penny from the public purse will be match by reform to make our nhs fit for the future we remember we be elect on manifesto to end sticking plaster politic and do the hard yard of fix our country and we will never betray that promise to the british people the public have right to know how public money will be spend and this be something we take extremely seriously they can put their trust in this government because we have fix the nhs before and with the help of this chancellor we will fix it again commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state yesterday yet again we see the chancellor do what the labour party always do default to high spending more borrowing and high taxis leave the public finance vulnerable the minister have speak of additional funding for the nhs to use the same comparison as the nhs england chief executive the nhs budget will now be roughly the equivalent of the entire gdp of portugal yet we be still none the wiser as to how the government actually intend to use most of the money there be no real detail and no real plan just last september the prime minister pledge that there would be no more money without reform despite the minister word that be exactly what the government have do there be still no plan for reform and the secretary of state be unwilling to set out the bold reform that be need despite year in opposition and nearly one year in government the labour party have fail to come up with plan for the nhs with the exception of the abolition of nhs england which will not happen for year and appear to be delay and in chaos minister respond to every write parliamentary question about it by say they can not set out the saving how the people will change or how the structure will change at this stage yet again there be still no plan we have be very clear that where the government be wrong we will oppose it but where they get something right we will work constructively with they that include reform but there be still no reform for we even to consider support can the minister tell we where the billion she set out will be spend the chief executive of the nhs confederation say yesterday that increase in nhs staff pay will account for large proportion of the funding increase the former nhs chief financial officer echo that view at the health and social care committee in january say that pretty much all the last tranche of additional spending be absorb by pay rise national insurance and inflation can the minister confirm how much the pay offer from the independent pay review body alongside increase national insurance will cost how much of this funding will have to go to cover that and how much will actually make it to the frontline to improve patient service the minister touch on the aim of meet the nhs week target for hospital waiting time within this parliament of course we wish the government well in achieve that and hope they succeed but just yesterday the times report that internal departmental modelling show they be not on track and could only come close to meet the target with implausible and over optimistic assumption the independent institute for fiscal studies agree can the minister set out how the government will meet that target again where be the plan we need plan not empty rhetoric it be clear that the nhs need reform not just more funding so when will the year plan finally be publish will it be before the one year anniversary of the labour party be in government will it be like their elective reform plan simply reheat of the plan that sajid javid bring forward in with nothing new the secretary of state need to be more ambitious word that suspect will never be echo by the prime minister or his team in no the capital budget remain broadly flat in real term from this year onwards the minister have say she wish to continue with the new hospital programme and invest in technology to boost productivity but it be unclear how that can be achieve with this settlement these be not my warning but those of respected independent think tank include the nuffield trust and the king fund the chancellor plan be clear indeed not one treasury minister have rule it out more tax rise be come finally and importantly we have see social care largely neglect again by this government there be just two sentence about it in four page statement social care deserve well the minister know very well that we can not improve the nhs without social care work well early today meet with social care provider they want to see reform yet the government have apparently abandon cross party talk on social care reform for an independent commission lead by the very able baroness casey who be still do her home office work on groom gang and be yet to be full time on this commission which have deeply unambitious finishing time of when will baroness casey be full time on the commission these provider be clear that they want seat at the table when well care fund be distribute by the nhs they want to have their voice hear in decision making on that funding will the minister agree to that finally the chief secretary to the treasury say he have model his assumption on continue trend in local government finance and local government precept in other word uplift in the precept however large number of county be now control by reform whose member be as ever notably absent from the chamber when we talk about health and social care who have pledge no tax rise whatsoever in their council if they do that what be the minister plan to make sure social care be fund as ever the government have go for the headline announcement but sadly without plan without delivery and with no real reform to benefit patient be entirely unclear after that run through of number of different issue whether the conservatives welcome the extra investment in the nhs or oppose it we know they oppose the mean of fund it but after that have no idea at some point they have to make up their mind whether they support that extra investment or not as say in my statement if they do not what out of the list of the improvement that we have already make would they not do as lord darzi make clear under the conservatives watch for year the nhs be break staff be leave with out of date equipment and unable to do the job they need to do we agree with lord darzi diagnosis but conservative members have still not say whether they agree with it or apologise for the state they leave the system in do not know whether the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar have not be able to read the elective reform plan or the urgent emergency care plan that we publish recently it be up to he to read those plan properly and try to understand what be happen the right hon gentleman have start to do my job for again because he cite various think tank and people who have say that this can not be do well can tell he that we be tell for example that waiting list would not drop in april because of seasonality but we have show by keep relentless focus on the system work closely with leader on the frontline and be clear with official in the department that it can be do that be what we hear this morning we be take relentless approach to spending line by line throughout the nhs and the department of health and social care we have roll up our sleeve and we will not accept put more and more taxpayer money into leaky system which be what happen under the right hon gentleman government if he have read the patient satisfaction survey he would know that taxpayer across the country in all our constituency love the nhs they understand that the tory party break it and that it will take long time to fix they also know that they be pay more taxis for it and get bad service and they expect we to do much well that be what we have already show we be do and what we will continue to do have outline the capital that be go into the new hospital programme which we be commit to and we have already see increase in diagnostic capability and surgical hub throughout our constituency we will continue to do more of that agree with the right hon gentleman that it be critical to ensure that social care be support alongside the nhs that be why billion be go into social care through our colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government and as he know louise casey will publish her interim report next year we be clear that fiscal responsibility do not stop at the treasury or down in victoria street with the department of health and social care it be important that everybody in the nhs be aware that we be determined to fix the nhs and put it back on sustained footing there be record investment that be our commitment to people and know from the people work with in the health service over many year that they be determined to make it well morale sink to an all time low under the conservative party but we be raise that morale and we will continue to work with the system to make sure that it be fit for the future welcome my hon friend statement about the record funding go into our nhs we be already see the benefit in my constituency with million of pound go into investment in our hospital that be so desperately need to get waiting list down people be leave behind by the conservative party and note that there be still no apology to any of my resident who be leave in pain and agony for year and year under their watch not one word of an apology one of the big challenge face my constituent be access an nhs dentist my hon friend know about that from the time she come to visit during my campaign be campaign to get new dentist for my constituent in gloucester so will she help to get meeting with the relevant minister to ensure that some of this record funding come to gloucester to get an nhs dentist for all my constituent as my hon friend say this be health area that know well and he have be the most amazing campaigner for gloucester and the health service there since he become the member of parliament he be absolutely right dentistry be key worry it be one of the key area that the conservative party neglect for year that be why it be manifesto commitment and why be able to outline today that meet the target of be front and centre and part of the plan as we go forward know that the minister for care who be responsible for dentistry be keen to meet many hon member and will make sure he have hear that request call the liberal democrat spokesperson to reiterate after year of conservative mismanagement the nhs be in crisis with patient leave wait hour for ambulance woman give birth in unsafe maternity unit and child turn up at with rot tooth because an nhs dentist can not be find that be the conservative legacy and they must never be trust with our health service ever again so yes we welcome this funding boost we really do and we agree that funding must come with reform because unless this funding be target properly it will not bring the change that patient urgently need when it come to reform we need to talk about fix social care because put more money into the nhs today will be like pour money into leaky bucket last year the secretary of state for health and social care state that billion year be waste because patient who be medically fit for discharge can not leave hospital simply because no care be available to support they at home the hospital in winchester that support both your constituency madam deputy speaker and mine have up to people wait to be discharge at any give time and they would be well care for with social care package we need urgent action and high minimum wage for care worker we need proper respite and financial support for family carer and clear commitment to conclude the social care review hold cross party talk and deliver the real reform that the minister have be talk about we also need to tackle the crisis in primary care because that be where prevention happen and where pressure on hospital be ease will the minister confirm that the funding boost will deliver the extra gps that be need to guarantee everyone an appointment within seven day or within hour for urgent case can she also confirm that the funding will bring dentist back into the nhs and bring an end to dental desert that will not happen without urgent reform of the nhs dental contract which be outdated unworkable and drive dentist out of the system finally we can not ignore the shocking state of nhs building include our hospital in winchester it be an outrage that overcrowded hospital must close operating theatre due to unsafe ceiling and other health and safety issue urge the minister to spend the money where it matter on primary care on social care and on ensure that our exist nhs building be fit for purpose thank the hon gentleman for welcome on behalf of his party the commitment that the chancellor have make and the extra funding that she have identify but think his party still oppose the way in which we have raise the funding to do just that it be good to have your cake and eat it but we be clear that the funding do come with reform as say in my statement we be committed to improve the front door primary care as well as social care and discharge that be why the nhs contribution as part of the settlement to the well care fund increase he will be aware that we previously revise the well care fund to make it well and more target on discharge which be important the urgent and emergency care plan that we publish couple of week ago also confirm our recognition that flow through the hospital system be important for patient and staff we must ensure that we do not face that continue crisis of corridor care over many year we be committed to the fair pay agreement and our colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government will make more statement in the come week about how that will work draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as chair of the all party parliamentary group for dentistry and oral health access to nhs dentistry be in crisis include in my constituency new analysis by the british dental association show that the share of nhs funding spend on dentistry have more than halve since from over to just know how commit the government be to reform the dental contract but the public accounts committee make it clear that reform will work only if it be back by proper sustainable funding will the minister ensure that nhs dentistry get fair share of the billion announce in the spending review so that we can end forever the crisis that be affect million across the country thank my hon friend for her question and for the work she do to support nhs dentistry as part of the all party group as have say this issue be of huge importance to our constituent and the shocking state in which the conservatives leave dentistry be there for all to see particularly the shocking state of child oral health that be why we act rapidly to introduce the toothbrushing campaign which if remember rightly be ridicule by conservative members when we discuss it in opposition and the arrangement with colgate to ensure that we improve child oral health we be absolutely committed to reform of the contract the minister for care be work hard on that and he will continue to update the house regularly it be our confirm commitment as have reiterate today to increase access to dental service call the father of the house our spending on the nhs be now as much as the entire gdp of portugal we use to be country with an nhs attach to it but we be almost become an nhs with country attach to it of course we would welcome this spending if we get the same outcome that people get in civilised country like the netherlands or australia but every time mention fundamental reform be dismiss as want to bring in privatisation so it be hardly worth raise that issue australia have an extremely successful pharmaceutical benefit scheme know that the secretary of state for health and social care go out there and have talk to australian doctor about it will the minister at least look at the successful outcome include some of the high life expectancy in the world that be be deliver in country like australia and the netherlands to see how we can deliver well outcome there be no point spend more money if people only right be to join the back of queue be expect the right hon gentleman to talk about the funding model and be disappointed that he do not it be something that he have talk about for many year do not know the detail of the australian model but will ensure that he get proper answer be always happy as be my right hon friend the secretary the state to look at model from across the world we want to learn from the good and we want to deliver the good in the nhs the conservatives seem to have an obsession with input into the health service it be true that the last government put more money in but it go into leaky bucket and they get nothing out this government have take different approach we be not just take money from the treasury hand it out and then come back for more we be be very clear with provider and the system more generally my right hon friend the secretary of state be talk at the nhs confederation conference this afternoon we be work with they to ensure that we look not just at the input but at what go on in the system we want to ensure value for taxpayer money in all our constituency there be outstanding example of both financial and operational good practice across the country we want to take the good to the rest and make the good of every taxpayer pound the minister have demonstrate the difference that labour government make to our nhs and to the people of our country as she mention reform be need may draw her attention to the report by the independent commission on palliative and end of life care around people can not access hospice care and too few people be able to access specialist palliative care the report demonstrate new system of end of life and palliative care that will transform people end of life experience to go alongside the reform agenda will she ensure that we invest in that precious time in people life and deliver comprehensive palliative care service my hon friend be right to highlight end of life care we know it have be neglect work on it during my time in the health service over year ago and feel very passionately about it it be important that we support people we must have system that allow people to have those conversation and that ensure there be option for people throughout the pathway of their life the minister for care be work hard to ensure that happen as part of our overall development of the health service over the next year will the minister confirm that the funding envelope that she set out in letter to the queen elizabeth hospital in king lynn in april stand unchanged after this spending review yes warmly welcome the news that waiting list be continue to fall not by chance but because of the choice make by this government as the minister will know both the hospital that serve my constituency have reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and both have receive funding but as visit gp surgery and dentist it be clear that there be link between crumble building and the availability of appointment will the minister reassure that primary care in particular will continue to be support by upgrade to building thank my hon friend for the great work that he be do to support progress on work at the raac hospital in his constituency he make the excellent point that such issue exist not only in hospital as our settlement make clear we understand the strain in primary care as well as in mental health service and community service which often do not get discuss when we publish the year plan later in the summer he will see that the move towards community and neighbourhood health service will be front and centre of what we want to achieve over the next year like my hon friend the member for winchester dr chambers welcome the increase investment and the attention that the new government be give to the nhs would like to turn our attention to dentistry my constituency of south devon be dental desert welcome the announcement of extra dental appointment but we have lose three dental surgery since the election last year and more be on the brink the government have be in office for year now and have talk about reform the dental contract with the nhs if that contract be not reform we will lose so many dentist that we will never be able to catch up how long will it take the government to announce newly reform contract with nhs dentistry so that we can start increase the number of appointment and save the dentist surgery that we have leave the hon lady be right to highlight the shocking state that dentistry be leave in by the last government they could have reform that contract at any time over the past year we be ready to do that in but thing work out differently we leave office and the liberal democrats and the conservatives between they do not reform the contract the minister for care be work at pace to ensure that happen and we will update the house as soon as possible very much welcome yesterday statement the funding and the fact that the funding will go on for several year do the minister agree that we depend on the people in our nhs will she join in congratulate dr cameron and all the team at the west suffolk hospital who by adopt whole hospital approach have abolish corridor care and improve the hospital throughput use model that could be widely adopt be very happy to thank dr cameron and the whole team as ever with his vast experience of the health service my hon friend make an excellent point we be reliant on clinical and managerial staff to make the system well know and he know how low morale have be lord darzi make that point very clear and we can not over estimate how difficult that be for staff that be why we have reach two record inflation beat pay settlement for staff and importantly we have support the independent process because we want to work with staff to make thing well at all level my hon friend give an excellent example of how by work with excellent clinical leadership and excellent manager we can bring the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs the minister will know that too want to abolish corridor care at the queen hospital in romford thank she deeply for meet on monday with the chief executive of the nhs trust for barking havering and redbridge matthew trainer who be appeal for new facility at the queen hospital the situation have lead to patient be care for on trolley in corridor find that unacceptable and it be cost my local trust which service people in the area an extra month because of additional staffing need will the minister ensure that what be say at our meeting be carry forward and that we get well facility for borough in the east london and essex area which the queen hospital serve the hon gentleman be absolutely right that this be unacceptable be pleased to meet he and his local nhs leader this week they make as hon member always do an excellent case clearly the situation be leave badly under his government hope that he will welcome the extra measure in this settlement know that my right hon friend the leader of the house tell he early that she look forward to he join we in the division lobby to support the extra funding hope that hon member know that whatever party they come from when meet they particularly in surgery will follow up on the question that be ask they be often matter for the local integrate care board but we will continue to work with all local system to deliver the good care possible for all our constituent as an nhs physiotherapist welcome the statement the government will soon launch their year plan for our nhs in which focus will be move from sickness to prevention will the minister set

background as well as from her constituency how important it be to look at the entire pathway of care for patient and to ensure that they have the good possible care as close to home as possible we think that be well not just for patient but for clinical outcome and it be more efficient and well use of taxpayer money the move from hospital to community be front and centre of our year plan as be deliver neighbourhood health service the minister will be well aware of sir andrew dilnot ambitious plan to put cap of on the cost of the social care that any family would ever have to pay it be never go to be easy to implement that previous government postpone the plan and the chancellor effectively scrap it completely may appeal to the minister to work across party line and to focus on the crippling debt that hit hard work family when they come to the end of their work life and need the support of the state agree that this issue absolutely need to be resolve there be agreement previously under the coalition and it be so disappointing that it be so unceremoniously dump when come to this place in that be one of the first thing that the subsequent tory government do it be great disappointment to many people across the country particularly those who be responsible for support an old person or disabled person we have ensure that we will address this issue and have appoint louise casey to lead the interim report know that she will continue to work with everybody and that all hon member will take an active interest in that work welcome the additional billion of day to day funding and additional capital announce yesterday our investment be already pay interest in the reduction of waiting list may remind hon member of the announcement make early this year be

service she have be such strong campaigner for shotley bridge and it have be pleasure to work with she know she have continue to advocate strongly on behalf of her local population the hospital be need but as she know in her community and all our community patient should not always be expect to travel to hospital for care that can be deliver close to home we see massive improvement in virtual care and technology which be why we have announce billion increase for technology over the spending review period we be improve the nhs app and ensure that people be enable to do more digitally but recognise that do not suit everybody so we will ensure that parallel process be available for everybody our constituent deserve and need care close to home and want more of it more money for the nhs be of course welcome although if we in the green party have our way it would be raise by tax extreme wealth fairly rather than by tax work the small amount of money for social care announce in the spending review be nowhere close to the funding need to tackle the social care crisis and the burden be put on local authority in the minister department there be reduction in the revenue budget for social care and public health when will her government stop go slow on social care when will they hold the long promise and much delay cross party talk when will they recognise as lord darzi have say that we can not fix the nhs without fix social care truly join up approach to health and social care be long overdue the economic of the green party be even more fantastical than the economic of the conservatives and reform we all dread to think what thing might be like under that party we see that in the local council in my city of bristol and it be an absolute disaster if the council could just get on with building council house and social home it would help more people to live well life and would aid prevention we be get on with tackle social care that be announce in the spending review and that be what the casey review will do warmly welcome the large ever capital investment in our nhs in the spending review yesterday build on the chancellor announcement in last year budget of the money to rebuild raac infest hospital such as frimley park hospital which will benefit my constituent that be commit to by the previous conservative government but shockingly it be never pay for with the government stand four square behind rebuild frimley park hospital do the minister agree it be time for frimley health nhs trust to get on and announce the site for the new hospital thank my hon friend for his support for the chancellor statement and our commitment to the nhs know he have be work so hard on this issue on behalf of raac hospital and frimley park hospital since he become member of parliament last year and we be four square behind that work get on it be at the beginning of very long queue in the new hospital programme it be one of the thing we inherit we wish it be well inheritance but we be work with what we have we have put the new hospital programme on firm financial footing and frimley park be at the beginning of that queue we be very keen that people get on with it very quickly because there be very many other people wait behind they the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns be absolutely right about social care we have system in which healthcare be dependent on social care lord darzi say so and think even ministers have say so yet all funding be go into the nhs not into social care we be fundamentally pour the money into bucket with hole in the bottom the minister pretend the exact opposite of the truth will she share more honest assessment with the house what go on labour have year to think about it and here we be with the funding go into the nhs as the father of the house my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh say the minister be follow on from the last conservative government and pour more and more money into an unreformed nhs with social care system underneath it that be break and she be not do anything about it have already give history lesson about some of those year when the conservatives and the liberal democrats be in the coalition together we have commitment promise and cross party agreement the conservatives then get into government by themselves and break it so we be where we be we want to invest in social care which be why we have announce the billion we be see very interesting alliance go on between our green and conservative colleague they agree on something as we see in the lobby last week thank the minister for her statement and the excellent work that this government be do in bring additional investment in the nhs and bring waiting list down we have have to make really difficult decision to clear up the mess leave by the previous government and be sure we all agree that we need to protect our charitable adult social care provider will the minister facilitate meeting with myself and woodlands quaker home in my constituency which provide non profit residential social care for old people so that they be able to carry on in the good way possible my hon friend make an excellent point about bring down waiting list for his constituent and we be so pleased to see that that be continue as we be able to announce this morning he also make an excellent point about social care provider which do an amazing job for many of we who have close family member support by they and it be important that they be support and work be not sure whether an answer to his question about meeting need to be from my department or from my colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government but will ensure that he have an answer welcome the funding announce to repair hospital with raac which will hopefully include harrogate district hospital in my constituency it have already receive some money to remove raac in one building which have since be demolish but it still have million business case wait with the department of health and social care for the next round of raac repair will the minister set out timetable for repair to hospital such as harrogate and for when we should expect to know if we will receive some of that funding we be committed to ensure that those raac hospital be sorted and fit for purpose and be able to visit airedale myself recently we be ask people on the ground to do really difficult job keep hospital go and serve patient while remedy the problem of raac do not have in front of the exact timescale for the hon gentleman hospital but encourage it to work very closely with the team at the department of health which think be work really well as long as clear timetable have be put forward will ensure that the hon gentleman get response to his question thank the minister for her statement the nhs be the no issue for my constituent and know that they will welcome the investment in the spending review my constituency be rural area and one thing people often raise with be ambulance waiting time which be pleased to report have improve in every category over the past year can the minister explain how the spending review will ensure continue improvement in ambulance waiting time support my constituent to get emergency care when they need it my hon friend be right to raise the issue of ambulance we ensure that they be key part of our urgent and emergency care plan which be issue the week before last think can not remember the exact date we recognise how crucial that issue be and how much more can be do by ambulance by the roadside be privileged to go out with the south western ambulance service recently it be so impressive to spend time on the frontline with people who be deal with whatever come at they we know that they can do more include remotely we be very keen to ensure that ambulance do not spend time outside hospital that be why we have introduce minute turnaround time through the release to rescue scheme which have work very successfully in many part of the country we be keen to see that scheme roll out across the country so that we do not have ambulance queue outside of hospital with people but put they back on the road where they need to be we have be here before with government of all different political persuasion minister come to the dispatch box and trumpet what seem like very attractive amount of money for the nhs but the reality on the ground be that that money just about cover pay rise and inflationary pressure on care buckinghamshire council and no doubt all council be worried that the money be offer up may only just cover thing such as the fair pay agreement can the minister confirm from the dispatch box that with increase amount of council budget rightly be spend on care they will get fund for thing such as the fair pay agreement separately from core social care spend the hon gentleman say that we have be here before and we really have be on primary care trust board under the last labour government so see at first hand what good government work with local system can deliver the good patient satisfaction in the nhs history the low waiting list and the good access to gp and primary care we have be here before and that be what we will do again from the hon gentleman question do not understand whether he want more spending or less that be what the conservative party be still not say its member stand up and ask for more like liberal democrat members but they will not identify the mean of raise that money in fact they oppose they to respond to the specific question that the hon gentleman ask over the come week my colleague from the ministry of housing communities and local government will obviously be outline in more detail how the spending review will fall out welcome this brilliant investment in our nhs which will also be welcome by my constituent know that this labour government will ensure that everyone in every part of the country benefit include woman last year highlight that woman in norfolk face the long wait in the country for gynaecological care with hundred wait more than year for treatment for condition such as endometriosis can the minister assure that as we advance these plan for the nhs we will ensure that we tackle those waiting list far too many woman be pay the price for year of inaction under the conservatives my hon friend have be such strong and powerful campaigner for woman health since become an mp last year and she be absolutely right to do that be pleased that we have be able to make some progress on condition such as endometriosis many campaign have be fight by many woman in this house include you madam deputy speaker if may say so to highlight the importance of this issue we see woman health as front and centre we want to learn from the woman health hub in their different guise and ensure that they be an integral part of neighbourhood health service be really sadden that there be no mention of cancer in the minister statement so will give she the opportunity to correct that omission will this new money for our nhs ensure that all cancer waiting time target be meet by the end of this parliament and can the minister confirm that those target will be include in the year health plan finally have ministers have chance to read my page letter and accompany submission on what should be in the national cancer plan have slight get out of jail free card because think that letter might be with one of my colleague not with obviously though look forward to the summary the hon gentleman make really important point about cancer would have to check but do not think mention lot of disease specific area include key manifesto commitment such as dentistry obviously cancer be huge part of waiting list overall we will get those waiting list down we be determined to meet that target and we will issue cancer plan later in the year thank the minister for support the launch of sarcoma uk report yesterday the recommendation in that report be really important for tackle that awful rare cancer welcome the ambition in what have be present but the comparison with what my edinburgh south west constituent face in scotland could not be more stark have just come from meeting in which yet again have be try to defend the mental health provision at scottish action for mental health redhall walled garden in contrast hear from the dispatch box real ambition to support people with mental health problem people in scotland be also jealous of the fall waiting list they see in england and hope that one day they will arrive in scotland may ask the minister to keep on be ambitious in the hope because hope be all have that some of it will rub off on the scottish government as madam deputy speaker be feel little generous may also say that saturday will mark the oriam parkrun in my constituency if we be serious about preventative healthcare activity parkrun be great example of how we can improve both our mental health and our physical health the minister be welcome to attend of course always shudder little when be invite to do any run jogging boxing or whatever else people get up to we all have our own thing we like do although my hon friend fabulous city be great place to be will not be able to join in this weekend but wish good luck to everybody take part we all live in hope that the snp might learn some lesson from what we be do to fix our nhs we remain willing to work with the snp and with anybody who want to serve patient and get well service for their taxis if the snp want to get in touch it can do so but the good thing to do be to elect labour government in scotland which will hopefully happen soon my hon friend make an important point about mental health we be committed as we say in our manifesto to more people work in mental health and to ensure that our school and young people have the support they deserve thank the minister for agree to visit north devon district hospital very shortly and look forward to welcome she to my constituency despite some welcome extra repair under the estate safety fund that hospital now face many year of make do and mend what provision have the government put aside for those year of increase maintenance cost thank the hon gentleman for his question his invitation have be long run one and sometimes his diary have be busy than mine but think we finally have date to go to north devon which be look forward to it be challenge system we have good debate yesterday in westminster hall about many of the problem in devon and know he will review that debate carefully devon be one of the system that we be look closely at it have have deficit funding this year but we want to eradicate deficit funding from the system so we be look very closely at how every single system use all of its money know that the hon gentleman will continue to support the government in ensure that his local taxpayer get the good service for their money welcome the comprehensive spending review and its focus on nhs funding it will deliver on labour election promise to get the nhs back on its foot which will be of so much benefit to my constituent do the minister agree that nearly one year on this labour government be really tackle the disastrous conservative liberal democrat reform introduce under the lansley legislation my hon friend have be such strong advocate for watford since he come into this chamber and in particular for ensure that that hospital be in the new hospital programme look forward to visit his constituency soon because know we lose some time my hon friend be absolutely right do not know if he know this but other will have hear say before that one of the terrible consequence of the lansley reform be that they make so angry as manager in the system that decide to become member of parliament and here we be today we have learn from the lack of focus on the frontline and on patient care that be why we be so clear whether in the reform we have put forward on elective care and urgent emergency care or in the plan reform on dentistry and primary care in the year plan and on social care that we have to keep relentless focus not just on taxpayer money but on patient the people priority be clear they want the nhs to do well but they be clear in their demand that we make it work well for they and make sure that every single pound of taxpayer money be work to the good effect welcome the minister statement and this government commitment to invest in the nhs but she do not address how that funding will be allocate across the country my constituency of blackburn have one of the bad gp to patient ratio with more than patient per gp that be place immense strain on primary care and push patient to an already overstretch hospital that be frequently on red alert will the minister ensure that area with such disparity like blackburn receive target support will she meet to address these long stand imbalance in healthcare provision the hon gentleman make an excellent point on primary care which see of contact with the nhs and be where most people experience the nhs that be why it be very much in our sight to support that work as part of our year plan we will bring forward the neighbourhood health service to make sure that people can be see more locally that will be build around use primary and community care to good effect he make point about funding formula we have long debate about that yesterday in westminster hall and it be an area of huge controversy he will see over the come week how the funding be allocate nhs england do issue if he have not see it will make sure that he have access to it guidance on the funding formula and where the different system be in relation to that we want to move everybody towards that target and be happy to discuss that with he once he have have look this government have make phenomenal progress on the elective care waiting list leave by the last government but the progress on mental health waiting list have be stubbornly slow with million people still wait for treatment that include people cover by the west yorkshire icb that serve my calder valley constituency which think be the second high figure in the country can my hon friend please assure that we will use this settlement to redouble the work we have do on elective waiting list while also put real focus on mental health waiting list my hon friend make an excellent point on mental health which be of great concern to all member he be right that elective care and mental health be measure in different way but we be commit to support mental health service with extra staff we be make sure in particular that young people in school be support we know that the situation have be terrible for young people in our country and we will continue to provide that relentless focus the labour government have commit more money to the nhs and that have to be welcome for that reason thank the minister for her statement today the chancellor yesterday announce some million this do tie in to health for casement park however the government be clear that that be dependent on funding from the northern ireland executive do the minister expect the northern ireland executive to take extra money grant to the northern ireland assembly through barnett consequential and divert they to sport stadium be the money for the nhs ringfence and protect if not how do look parent in the eye in my constituency of strangford when their child can not receive cutting edge medical technology because money have to be find for sport stadium the hon gentleman be an experienced parliamentarian and he understand how the funding settlement for the department of health and social care be allocate through the barnett formula to northern ireland this investment be so welcome because my constituent in cannock chase have be struggle to access urgent care between their gp and accident and emergency since our hospital minor injury unit be temporarily close in march despite the welcome investment in rawnsley surgery chadsmoor medical practice and red lion surgery in my constituency our icb plan to kibosh any hope of our miu reopen do the minister agree that this government huge investment in our nhs need to be feel in the part of the country such as my town and village that be so badly let down by the conservatives will she meet to discuss the worrying urgent care reform proposal for staffordshire thank my hon friend for welcome the extra support for gp and primary care be sure he understand from our urgent and emergency care plan that we have number of arrangement for make sure that people be see urgently in local community setting it be for local icb to decide on the good way within that urgent emergency care plan for people to be see locally and treat within the available resource be happy to meet he perhaps at an upcoming surgery to discuss that far my constituent in blackpool south will never forgive or forget that the previous government leave we with the bad health outcome in the country we have an icb have to make million of cut the hospital that my son and be bear in have be leave inadequate and one of the bad in the country we have dental desert people can not get access to mental health counsellor or gps welcome the million of pound allocate to victoria hospital and to health outcome in my constituency by this government and we be see waiting list finally come down do the minister agree that we need to continue on this path and give deprived area such as blackpool more support to get our waiting list down to an acceptable level my hon friend be absolutely right that his constituent and constituent across this country will not forgive the conservatives for the state in which they leave the nhs that be clear from lord darzi diagnosis we have still have no comment from the conservatives on whether they acknowledge that we be determined to be about the future and that be what this settlement and the chancellor announcement yesterday be about it be about put that extra funding that we raise last year into service and into reform system that reach all part of this country we will tackle health inequality make sure that people who have not have that access and people who suffer bad health than other be raise up we must take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs after more than an hour of diligent bobbing call chris vince apology for my premature bob early madam deputy speaker thank the minister for her statement today and for her ongoing commitment to the nhs welcome the growth in day to day spending on the nhs and this government commitment to bring down nhs waiting time however may gently advocate for harlow in respect of the future of the uk health security agency it have business case detail design and site ready to go and the estimate timeframe have consistently be assess as the good value for money and the quick to deliver like how my hon friend say gently because honestly no day go past without he talk about this issue or indeed his new hospital he be right and he be fantastic campaigner for the people of harlow he have make his point again and can not make any further comment today but he will be hear from the secretary of state soon on that issue thank the minister for her answer this afternoon ask anyone who be leave before the select committee statement to do so quickly and quietly industrial strategy business and trade committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the business and trade committee liam byrne will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair and not to the relevant ministers and that front benchers may take part in questioning rise to commend to the house the seventh report of our select committee and the combined brilliance of committee member in set out plan blueprint and framework for scrutiny of the industrial strategy which be still to come our report start with note of optimism because the truth be that we stand on the cusp of once in century transformation of our economy from which britain stand to gain enormously in the next decade alone the world economy may grow by something like trillion and those prize could be seize by britain in the race on which we have embark we happen to hold many of the card in world that be build wall we in this country be build bridge to new market in world that be about to be transform by artificial intelligence we be science superpower in world that be cry out for energy we be on the cusp of build green energy abundance time and again throughout our long history these isle of wonder have make history by invent the future even now we have the future potential in our grasp in way that we have not have for decade but this report be sobering read because its conclusion be that our performance right now be very different from our potential and promise be not go to be delivery unless we remake the state for new age and renew the partnership between public ambition and private enterprise we will squander the rich that could lie within our grasp our committee have find that we be trap by obstacle of our own making we have sky high energy cost that be drive away industry we have broken system of procurement that squander billion every single in every of our gdp we have chronic skill gap that lock out million from the potential job that they could get stick into and which deny firm the skill that they need to grow we have block on innovation diffusion that hoard breakthrough with superstar firm we have finance system that all too often starve scale up of capital and we have whitehall machine that be over centralised risk averse and too complex to drive change at the speed that the modern economy demand those be not condition of growth they be condition of decline and this country need to rally to fix they fast we therefore argue in the report that the industrial strategy have to break through the confine on growth we need an ambition that be as great as the challenge before we and we argue that that mean mobilise public and private action around the grand challenge the moonshot that be go to define the next century we argue that we should maximise domestic demand through dramatic overhaul of our public procurement system we need to maximise foreign demand for the thing that we make here through the trade deal that we strike with our ally around the world we need to rewire the institution of our economy in skill energy finance and innovation and we then need to transform whitehall itself by devolve power where we can cut red tape and put region back in control of their own destiny in this report we set out practical step for how we can achieve every single one of those ambition and we then set test by which the forthcoming industrial strategy could be well judge there must be vision so that we can steer effectively there must be metric so that we can judge progress effectively there should be grand challenge set out by the government to help galvanise rally around national purpose and the possibility of the future there have get to be procurement reform so that the billion that the state spend each year drive domestic demand in new way there have to be trade alignment to connect our strength with the global marketplace into which we sell there have to be far well access to scale up finance to stop business be lift and shift largely to the united states there have to be cheap energy because we hear overwhelmingly that our energy price be simply uncompetitive there must be devolve skill fund where mayoral area can prove that they be fit for purpose to help manage and organise technical education there need to be much wide diffusion of research in order to spread prosperity above all there have to be leadership from the very top drive by the prime minister himself and there have to be new way in which we cut through the incoherence of regulation that bedevil business today we propose bold devolution of power money and responsibility particularly to mayoral area where they can prove that they be up to the task we propose new legislation to put the industrial strategy advisory council on statutory footing with the prime minister chairing meeting at least once quarter we propose that the regulatory innovation office be expand and move to the cabinet office and that it take on the role of clearing house to make sure that there be somewhere that business can go in order to highlight ridiculous conflict between rule and regulation that just hold back growth day after day we also propose hardwire the link between the industrial strategy advisory council and the new council of the nations and regions yesterday we see some progress on number of our recommendation our committee be nothing if not influential with both the treasury and the department for business and trade on capital access the british business bank be now set to receive almost billion in order to crowd in ten of billion of pound more and the national wealth fund will grow to almost billion but we have to simplify access to that finance for business that need it on energy we have confirmation of investment in sizewell offshore wind and small nuclear reactor but we need low energy cost in the here and now on skill there will be an extra billion by for more learner but the skill governance reform that we need be not quite clear enough and business need those reform pronto on research and development billion year be promise by and there be target fund for advanced manufacturing defence innovation the advanced research and invention agency and the new edinburgh supercomputer those be good beginning but without clear plan to diffuse the good idea to every corner of our economy we will not get the uplift in productivity that this country need there be without doubt big challenge but what give we heart as we take evidence over the course of this year be that business trade union and consumer group be up for the challenge they genuinely believe that we can become the fast grow economy in the in conclusion and recommendation we set out very clearly the step that ministers could and should take in order to unlock the possibility of the future my final message be that we should draw lesson from our history over the course of the last century and since the day of joseph chamberlain there have be geopolitical shock every to year that have force we to think anew about the sovereign capability that we need which always lead to conclusion about how we remake the state for new time we be at exactly such moment in our history and yesterday give we some heart that there be investment go into the thing that business need this government want to invest in growth good job and good wage but the potential of this country will be squander unless we now build on the kind of ambition that we hear yesterday and implement the step that our committee have set out above all think that our plan be practical and have no reservation in commend it to the house thank the chair of the business and trade committee for his hard work it be really hearten that the report have receive cross party support on the committee and across the house this be about growth and the economy which affect every single one of our constituent do he agree that the word practical be absolutely right in this case the industrial strategy can not simply be soviet style tractor production statistic list it can not be self congratulatory our report be practical and provide almost blueprint and its implementation be absolutely key the right hon gentleman have do an excellent job of set out the potential that be within our reach the trick be to make it within our grasp the hon gentleman be absolutely right this report be an awful lot strong for the raft of amendment that he bring forward and for the thought and devotion he put into committee hearing and the interrogation of our witness he be absolutely right because ultimately we as country will not unlock performance that match our potential unless we think again about the way in which business and the government work together for new time that be the only way in which we will both tackle the stubborn challenge of the past particularly the under investment that have bedevil we for so long and navigate the seminal challenge of the future there be no ideology in this report well perhaps there be but the only ideology be confidence in our country and confidence that we can be well than we be today which be practical blueprint for turn those ambition into action thank the chair of the committee for the opportunity to come in on the topic of this important inquiry which be glad to be part of one of the good day of the inquiry be the day we welcome roundtable of small and medium sized enterprise in the automotive sector to talk to we about the threat pose to they at the time from the tariff impose by the united states and more broadly about the challenge that sme face in advanced manufacturing and automotive do he agree that as our report set out the industrial strategy must be one for sme across all the growth sector as well as for the large prime and big organisation my hon friend be absolutely right the evidence base we be able to assemble be an awful lot strong because of her connection with small business in her constituency and the insight she be able to bring from the world of labour the point she make be absolutely right past industrial strategy have sometimes conjure up image of corporate britain call the shot but this country real potential be actually in abundance in small firm unless we can make sure that on our island it be easy to start business easy to scale up business easy to hire people and easy to give people pay rise we be not go to unlock our full potential and that be what this report set out to do we have clearly in our mind the richness and potential of our small firm and we want our economy to be big and well place for they congratulate the right hon gentleman on his statement and his committee report which be welcome the summary clearly say britain economic institution and market especially in public procurement energy skill and critically the diffusion of innovation and finance must be modernise for new time in the spirit of the partnership he speak of between the public sector and private sector he will no doubt have be glue to the debate on the sustainable aviation fuel bill yesterday when point out that most of the government advanced fuel funding be go on foreign own technology how do he think and do his committee consider the way that the approach to government grant scheme for innovation need to change to ensure that we keep talent and innovation here at home the hon gentleman make really important point we have hear time and again we hear it in relation to life science defence and clean energy that we have some of the good thinker in the world but they often struggle to get the start up finance or the scale up finance they need to turn those ambition into new business as someone who spend four year build business before be in the wrong place at the wrong time and get elect to this house know that what small business need to grow be sale that be why we need to be do much smart job of marry public contract with access to scale up finance but that will take the institution we have today work very differently in the future perhaps our most shocking evidence session be on the subject of public procurement when the chief commercial officer of his majesty government be just not clear how many job how much economic growth and what level of wage be drive by of gdp that be simply not good enough hope that there be cross party consensus about these reform because ultimately this be once in year moment our recommendation should command cross party support because that be how we ensure that they be sustainable for the long term echo the comment of the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper about work across the party this be about growth and about the chair drive this forward the test we have outline be about how the document have real world impact for two of the test be clear first how do an industrial strategy galvanise action across the government with previous industrial strategy good as they may well have be department other than business do not see it as their responsibility to deliver we must make sure that the department for energy security and net zero the department for transport and so on have ownership too and responsibility for deliver the strategy be keen to get my right hon friend comment on that secondly how do this industrial strategy create positive operating environment so that boardroom in the uk and across the world see the uk as place to invest and do business again be keen for his comment on that be grateful for that question again the report be lot strong for the insight my hon friend be able to bring to what be very sustained inquiry we must recognise that two problem have bedevil industrial strategy in this country in the past one be stop start we get some progress but then we stop and then we think again that point be make with some power by greg clark whose work commend and whose evidence want to highlight this be about build different kind of partnership for different kind of economy we have tremendous strength we love the rule of law we be politically stable we be an open trading economy and we be science superpower this be great place to do business but if we be to become the world favourite place to invest we must change the way that the government and the private sector work together if we get it right the industrial strategy council could be exactly that place but the offer our committee make to the business community be that where thing get stuck we be here to help rise order can run this only until pm so can question and answer be brief please thank the chair for his leadership we enjoy be under it to focus on one thing energy cost be cause havoc around the country lead to many company go to the wall do he think this emergency should be to dealt with by cut energy cost deal with the distortion between gas and electricity and give well access to manufacturer so that they can get the power they need the hon gentleman be absolutely right perhaps the most critical test of the industrial strategy when it be publish will be whether it bring industrial energy cost down if it fail that test it be go to struggle to make progress thank my right hon friend for his excellent chairship of the committee he speak about the grand challenge we face we hear in the evidence session how we have such structural challenge we have just hear about energy and we could say the same about skill particularly so could he say bit more about some of the work be do and the need for whole of government approach that be absolutely right the challenge we face as country be so large that no one department business or sector can solve they on their own the only way to crack the code of that challenge and to reach our ambition for the future be by mobilise whole of society approach otherwise frankly we be go to fail and squander the potential in front of we it seem quite radical to suggest as the report do devolve responsibility for technical education and training to local leader and transfer responsibility for skill to the department for business and trade will the right hon gentleman briefly expand on that and explain how it relate to apprenticeship on the one hand and university education on the other this be an important area of debate when we be frame our recommendation we feel that where mayoral area could show ability that might be limited number they might be much well able to understand the need of business and to ensure that local technical college in particular provide the right kind of skill and of qualification sometimes we take too much of central planning approach to the skill system which mean we be just not agile enough for the need of employer today and skill gap therefore loom much too large thank the chair for the report particularly for the framing in which it land the industrial strategy from read the report believe there could be great emphasis on the convene role of high education university not just as driver of and skill but for the industrial cluster in their locality do he agree that the strategy could be more focused on build on the role of high education as collaborator and co ordinator my hon friend be right we have to be careful not to stray too far into the territory of our sister committee but once upon time we build village around factory in today economy we need to build local economy around university the role of university in empower economic change be something we will want to return to in the very near future final two question and answer very short please congratulate the select committee the chair and its member on the publication of the report which of the test ensure that business growth will be ethical moral and responsible and which of the test protect the consumer the public and the environment very clear answer leadership from the top and that mean come from the prime minister directly thank the chair and the committee very much for the report it be incredibly helpful the chair refer to growth for all within the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in the industrial strategy one of the issue for northern ireland company have be buy into the public procurement process perhaps the chair could tell we how we in northern ireland can catch up with the rest of the united kingdom we hear this message loud and clear from harland and wolff when we be there long term contract not year to year contract with real stability so that genuine partnership can grow and grow strong over time backbench business send funding beg to move that this house have consider the distribution of send funding be delighted to have secure this debate as it give we an opportunity to highlight the situation we be face in england where child with special educational need and disability be be leave behind due to the inherent regional inequality in the high need national funding formula there be big issue the more typical thing we talk about be the overall quantum of spending base on overall need but too little attention be give to the distribution of the funding that exist whether in healthcare education police or otherwise know be not the only member be turn to by constituent at their wit end try to navigate what feel to be broken system thank colleague across the house for their continued advocacy on behalf of some of the most vulnerable child in all our community my argument be simple yet deeply important one the current model of send funding be not only inconsistent but in too many case profoundly unfair it fail to account for genuine level of need the reality face by family and the systemic pressure that school and local authority be under unless that change we will continue to fail child who rely on member to make their case and to get this right the right hon gentleman make profoundly important point there be real and urgent need to reform the send system and that of course include how it be fund do he welcome the million ringfence in yesterday spring statement for exactly that to transform our send system to make it fair for parent well for young people and more sustainable for the future the hon gentleman take to point far on in my speech but he be absolutely right he make the case to the minister exactly as intend to give that we have break distribution system and give the severity of its impact on so many child and family will she ensure that the money in the spending review be as the hon gentleman rightly say use precisely for that purpose and that we target those who be most leave behind at the heart of this debate be call on the government to identify and commit to clear baseline cost for deliver effective send support per pupil the figure must reflect what it genuinely take in both urban and rural setting to support child with complex need across the country only then can we ensure that no child opportunity be limit by where they live want to bring to the attention of the house stark example that illustrate the postcode lottery in send funding the disparity between the east riding of yorkshire which cover my own constituency of beverley and holderness at the low end of the funding spectrum we be the lowest fund in the country and the london borough of camden which happen to be the high camden by any standard be well resource inner city borough with strong proximity to specialist service it currently receive of send fund for each pupil in its area meanwhile in east riding rural area with few nearby service long travel distance and great challenge in recruitment and retention per pupil high need funding come in at around that be gap of over for every single child require extra support in real term if east riding funding be match not with camden but with the second most poorly fund local authority we would have an extra million per year on top of the million we receive in the high need million extra if we be bring into line with camden we would have an extra million some might argue that urban area face different pressure and of course they do but let we be clear the cost of deliver quality send provision in rural area be not low in fact it be often significantly high transport cost colleague across the house will be aware of child who have to be move great distance to access their support for child with complex need can be astronomical recruit specialist staff such as special educational need co ordinator to work in isolated school be constant challenge when service such as educational psychologist or speech and language therapist be not base locally school and family face unacceptable delay in access the assessment need to unlock further support why then be rurality not factor into the high need funding formula what that mean in practice be that two child with identical need live in different part of the country will receive vastly different level of support one might have their education health and care plan review on time access in school provision and benefit from local therapy service the other might be leave waiting month for assessment with school already at break point try to bridge the gap this disparity will have long term detriment to child outcome this be not criticism of any local authority camden like all area face its own pressure and challenge but the system we have allow such disparity to persist without sufficient recourse or flexibility these widely vary funding allocation create two tiere system in what should be national commitment colleague from across the house will be familiar with constituent whose story lie bare the human cost of this imbalance whether it be parent desperately try to navigate the ehcp system the lack of suitable school place nearby to cope with the measure require by their ehcp or school struggle to cope this be also certainly not party political point successive government have sit over fund disparity and struggle with the politic they have be unprepared to reallocate perhaps for understandable reason the people you take money from tend to be much angry than the people you give it to are happy one march on westminster the other grunt and say about time it be truly difficult thing have be in this place for year and have struggle to get ministers to accept reallocation and reapportionment rather than ask for that demand which have so far fail in year of effort to get anybody to implement hope to come up with something more practical if compromise as result commend my right hon friend on his length of service to this house my hon friend the opposition deputy chief whip and indeed my whip be very welcome thank very much be grateful for that we have this issue of how we fix broken and clearly unfair system new colleague and there be many of they in the house might think well surely people would want to fix it there be no perfect system and there will always be dispute but if the government do map of need fundamentally an assessment of what fair would look like and then map against that line where everyone be new member might think the government might be prepare to do something with those who be most overfunded to help compensate the underfunded my experience be that they do not and will not so will discuss practical way of get change what typically happen be that despite ministers talk in debate like this one we end up with the treasury at spending occasion like yesterday give if inflation be it give to everybody that mean that the cash gap between one authority and another grow and in sense the injustice grow with it be grateful to the right hon gentleman for lead the debate be conscious that york be in the bottom third and that the level of child be diagnose with send be rise sharply do he agree that in order to future proof the system we need to look at more holistic therapeutic and nurture approach to our education system so that all child benefit look at the situation in sweden and see how that not only bring down cost but greatly benefit the child there the hon lady be two thing she be quite right and she be tempt down path do not want to go down want to focus on the distribution because it do not get the attention however she be absolutely right labour criticise the performance of the then conservative government but think fund for send actually grow from to she be right that it be not about who be in government somehow we need to find way of cap this demand which will outstrip any chancellor however well intentione that be an issue will turn back to the point on which be focus which be distribution if demand in system be grow at scale that no government can meet distribution although ignore become even more important if system be strain and struggle have grossly unfair distribution that no one seek to or be able to defend it be not case of one party or the other claim they be get it right they recognise it be unjust be major mistake and we must find way to balance it over time it be not obvious at the moment that anyone be able to stop this imbalance between supply which be so small and demand which be so big colleague will have local champion back home who do their good to fight against regional inequality take this opportunity to pay tribute to councillor victoria aitken in the east riding who be the portfolio holder responsible for send and her role with the group for any new member present the group fight on the issue of and focus on the funding formula disparity it be technical and quite dull but it be vital for the provision of service to our constituent in her role with the group victoria have be tireless in campaigning to address these issue within the send system but sadly the work of victoria and other like she be not enough want to share the story of my constituent ellie and her son harry who be nine and half year old and have adhd from the very start of his education as early as foundation stage both ellie and his teacher recognise that harry need extra support however without an ehcp in place the help he require simply be not available despite the school do all that it could last summer as harry be prepare to enter year ellie contact in desperation harry be still only just begin to read and be spend his break time play with child much young than himself ellie have fight tirelessly to secure an assessment so that he could access one to one support but the process be gruelle and caseworker be at capacity ellie have to give up her job to dedicate herself to the countless hour need to complete form lodge appeal chase response and provide support at home she put her own education on hold and in her own word have have to battle the system every step of the way just last week after year of delay harry be finally grant an ehcp however the school still do not know when the funding will arrive to put the support which have now be recognise in place harry will start year this september several year behind his peer ellie describe harry as kind and lovely boy who have be fail not by his school but by system that delay deflect and deny the support that child like harry need yet ellie remain determined to keep fighting no matter the cost to she or her family to ensure that harry get the help he deserve congratulate the right hon gentleman on secure the debate declare my usual interest my wife be special educational need co ordinator at local authority school in our patch and my daughter have an ehcp and complex set of disability so have absolutely fight this battle myself do the right hon gentleman agree that what he have just describe be broken system that need reform and that whatever we see in the white paper in the autumn we will hopefully see reform that rely in particular on more training for all teacher across the profession think that be some of what he have just describe the hon gentleman be right there be capacity issue as say relate to demand get people not just specialist but the whole system and everyone in it to have well understanding be really important the hon gentleman will see that in his constituency as do in mine it be not enough just to have the senco it be about get the leadership the training and the right protocol in place to ensure that the whole system be well able to meet the need of child and that will then reduce some of the other impact include cost impact on the system in recent week have the privilege of visit inmans primary school in hedon where staff speak candidly about the mount pressure create by soar demand for send provision pressure that far exceed the funding currently available at st mary school in beverley headteacher laura wallis express her deep concern at the grow gap between pupil need and the resource she have at her disposal make it ever more difficult to provide the tailored support every child deserve have meet people from about school both here in westminster and at home in the constituency and more recently have hear the voice of young people on send in doncaster at every single meeting the first question ask be about support capacity and young adult transition into work do the right hon gentleman agree that to get the funding right we need to listen to the voice of people with experience those at the grassroot to ensure that we understand their idea and solution and direct funding into the right place have to agree with the hon gentleman who make powerful point my appeal to colleague in the chamber particularly perhaps to new member be to focus on the distribution it can be quite hard to get one head around the many issue that be involve the overall national issue of quantum service delivery training and the rest of it and distribution can easily get leave behind yet it be vital can not say that it bring great deal of joy or satisfaction to member of parliament to pursue it because so many people look blank when it be mention but distribution be important and hope that colleague will want to take on the issue very quickly some child thrive academically while some thrive practically it be all about find the right place for they whether as doctor mechanic plasterer or farmer when it come to check on child ability and ensure that they find their place we must acknowledge that there be not standard box for all it be different for each child as usual the hon gentleman hit the nail on the head many across this house will recognise the story of the school have just mention because the same thing be play out in constituency across the country parent be become de facto care co ordinator school be dip into ever shrink budget to fund specialist provision and local authority be catch between legal responsibility and budgetary reality be contact by parent in my constituency who be force to navigate complex and lengthy tribunal process simply to challenge the decision to place her autistic son in mainstream school only to have the hearing cancel at the last moment and place at special school offer do the right hon gentleman agree that education health and care plan be not silver bullet that we should not need complex legal process to ensure that young people can access good early support that support must meet the young person need and that the money must follow the child or young person the hon lady be absolutely right be chair the education committee when the coalition government introduce the reform that bring in ehcp as replacement for statement remember think then that lot of good improvement be make there be very sincere ministers work hard at it and they bring in well system but the fundamental remain as they be one of the aim be to get away from an adversarial legalistic process in which articulate and typically well off people be able to use sharp elbow to get their child what they need but pity the inarticulate single mother unable to engage with the system what would she get the then government promise be to make that well but the fundamental remain if demand be so much big than supply this be what we will get with the good will in the world local authority will end up be defensive and say no as matter of course and will give way only when they be force to be go on too long madam deputy speaker could not possibly say for year have fight for fairer distribution of send funding and for year have get nowhere as successive government labour and conservative have lack the courage to rebalance the system hope labour will not lack that courage again do not pretend to have all the answer to this problem but know that we must work out what fairness look like and the minimum per pupil cost require for send support and commit to meet that basic need if not immediately then at least over time this government need to be prepared to take from those above the baseline and give to those below would they be prepared to do that no previous government have be but perhaps this one will if not we must find some other way we could identify through mapping exercise those who have be leave behind and we could say as matter of principle that whenever there be an above inflation increase in the budget such as the million that the chancellor come up with in the spending review yesterday it will always be use first and foremost to lift up those below the line while do nothing to cause below inflation increase for those who be above the line even if the minister agree with that idea there will still be crisis management how do we begin to tackle systemic inequality above all it be vital that we revisit the high need national funding formula because it do not sufficiently account for regional cost difference or for the genuine cost of deliver service in dispersed or under serve area the formula must reflect both complexity of need and the geography of the area in which that need arise it need to account for the add cost of provide service in rural area it be vital too that the formula move away from the historical spend factor the part of the formula that base current funding on what local authority spend on send provision in the financial year and how it administratively describe that spend the formula mean that large section of funding be determine by pre covid demand for send service despite post pandemic spike the government have state their intention to remove that factor but progress have be painfully slow every year that we fail to act we condemn another group of child with complex need to struggle without the support that they deserve the issue be not simply how much money be available it be also how accessible and responsive the system be family be force into adversarial process school be burden with bureaucracy and child be too often treat as number on spreadsheet rather than individual with potential we need system that be focus on early intervention not crisis management be here not simply to raise problem but to call for action that action would ensure fair more transparent funding formula that reflect real world cost across the country account for rurality and discount historical spend it would establish clear baseline per pupil cost for deliver effective send support and ensure that every local authority be bring up to that level if not quickly then at least over time it would create well accountability mechanism so that area that be underperform on deliver send provision can be support and where necessary challenge at the very least ask that the government recognise the injustice of the system and the inequality that it produce those be not radical ask they be practical deliverable reform that would make meaningful difference for my constituent in beverley and holderness and believe and hope across the rest of the country we have duty as parliamentarian to ensure that every child regardless of background diagnosis or postcode have the support that they need to thrive the disparity in send funding undermine that duty if we believe in truly inclusive education system we can not continue to turn blind eye to the structural inequity build into the funding model we owe it to our constituent our school and most importantly the child to fix this rise inform member that even with an immediate three minute time limit will still not be able to get everyone in thank the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart for secure this important debate this issue affect family in huddersfield and across the country recently meet send parent from huddersfield to hear their experience of the system they be try to do the right thing and to get the right support for their child but too often the system work against they they tell that the system be difficult to navigate especially the process of gain an ehcp and any subsequent appeal process also hear from parent who be struggle to access home to education transport or who be not able to get their child into school due to poor mental health or it be the incorrect educational setting these story be not one off this be happen to too many family across the country and it be clear that something have to change welcome the work of local support service such as kirklees information advice and support service which offer free and impartial advice but it be deal with grow number of inquiry in huddersfield we see grow demand for specialist support but the funding be not keep pace with that demand local service be stretch school be under pressure and family be leave to navigate complex and often frustrating system last week visit the fantastic southgate school specialist school for child with complex special educational need spend time with its amazing pupil and teaching staff the teaching and support staff be passionate about their work but they speak to about the increase complexity that they be deal with and their struggle to access all the emotional and mental health support that they need for their pupil the transition to support be particular issue they also ask to raise the need to look again at the pay scale for support staff who be value member of the team the issue of pay be impact retention as the right hon member for beverley and holderness have say there be postcode lottery whether child get the help that they need often depend on local resource not their actual need we need to take into account wide need deprivation and the complexity of child circumstance welcome the government recent move to improve send provision they include inject an additional billion into service invest million in adapt classroom and build specialist facility and restructure the department for education to put send at its heart local authority like kirklees council need the tool and resource to respond properly to the challenge without sustainable funding formula local authority will struggle to provide timely solution school want to do the right thing as do council but they be often force to make impossible choice and that leave family to pick up the piece we need long term plan that give certainty to local area and put the voice of parent carer and child at the heart of decision making thank my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart for secure this important debate and for his work on this issue accord to the late figure there be around million school pupil in england with identify special educational need that equate to of all pupil of those pupil with identify sen around million receive sen support and around have ehcp in huntingdon the school that represent have express many concern about the whole send system and funding consistently underlie many of the issue that they face school pay the first towards meet the outcome of an education health and care plan the rest of the funding be top up by the local authority often the funding provide do not cover the cost that the school incur in support child with need urge the government to address that as matter of urgency as this be stop school from provide help to child suspect of require send support thank yasmine trace the headteacher of sawtry infant school and jo dyke the school send co ordinator for highlight this matter know that they speak on behalf of other school in huntingdon and across the country the unacceptably long wait to obtain an ehcp in huntingdon one child at wheatfields primary school wait week for draft have lead many desperate parent to seek to fund they themselves the cost of private educational psychologist assessment in huntingdon vary depend on the service require and the provider but it might be in the range of for full assessment or for an assessment of an under three for example full assessment could be with deposit and one provider offer an assessment for with deposit these figure be significant barrier for most family that represent it be yet another burden for parent and yet another reason why we need more support on offer the government have hint at sweeping change to the ehcp system and would welcome further detail and clarity for the many parent carer and teacher in huntingdon who be uncertain about what these change will mean there be fear among parent that the rug will be pull from under their foot would welcome it if the minister could confirm the ongoing support for ehcp go forward to conclude want all child to get the education care and support that they need there be grow number of child with send and we must adapt to ensure that they be cater for and do not fall by the wayside would welcome plan from the government on how they will support school in meet the cost of ehcp or of whatever they be replace with wish to hear that parent will be support throughout the process and that the government will not force parent down expensive route which most of they can not afford to ensure that their child get the education and support that they need thank the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart as it have for many member this issue have become quiet emergency in my constituency hertfordshire face many of the challenge with the funding and delivery of send provision that other part of the country be grapple with send support should be lifeline that enable child to reach their potential regardless of their diagnosis or circumstance in hertfordshire the system be creak ofsted and the care quality commission have say that there be widespread and systematic failing and too many family be lose out as result have raise number of story in the past of constituent who be deal with this issue today bring to the house the story of my constituent sarah who recently tell about her daughter grace grace suffer from avoidant restrictive food intake disorder alongside autism and dyslexia after long and traumatic journey through the nhs make hard by the lack of national care pathway for arfid grace spend six week at watford general hospital and further nine week at mental health unit in great ormond street her condition have thankfully stabilise but her recovery remain fragile now her mother sarah be face the daunting challenge of secure an appropriate education she be apply for an ehcp and have request place in specialist setting that would meet grace need but like many school it be oversubscribed mainstream environment crowded and overwhelming would simply be unworkable for grace whose previous experience in school have leave long last trauma sarah be even consider move country in search of suitable provision this be not an isolated case family in hertfordshire be tell we time and again that the system be fail the child who sit in these so call grey area child who require more than mainstream education can offer but who do not meet the threshold for the few specialist placement available hertfordshire be rank out of local authority in per head high need funding just of our local education budget go to send well below the national average of we be also face project million deficit in the send budget this year finish by thank ministers for their engagement on this issue and for meet and other hertfordshire labour mps know that the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins and for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra have also be diligently raise these issue be glad that the government be now look at the national funding formula and how it might be revise which hope will mean that hertfordshire end up with more support congratulate the government on their pledge to invest an additional billion into high need funding and look forward to see how this benefit all our child hampshire be county that fall into the group which be area that receive some of the low per pupil funding in the country this disparity be hit pupil with special educational need and disability the hard the cumulative deficit in hampshire for the dedicated school grant now sit at million that be not just number on spreadsheet but daily reality in school across my constituency despite have to find the first of funding for every ehcp school in north east hampshire as with elsewhere be bend over backwards to do everything they can to support these pupil headteacher in my constituency recently explain to that their budget this year be so tight and they have make every efficiency that they can that they will be force to reduce the amount of support for the child who do not have an ehcp but who do have additional need what be the sense in that when we know that early intervention lead to well outcome and low cost before be elect to the house run charity for young people with down syndrome and their family we see at first hand the impact that early intervention can make in build the fundamental skill for life that many of we take for grant walk talk and participate in society child with down syndrome will always need an ehcp yet the family still have to go through laborious process many child need bit of extra help at various point without an ehcp yet the funding formula also work against they because school can not afford to fund the support as lily mum explain after lily be deny an ehcp the emotional and financial toll be huge make bad by constant pushback and denial there endless talk of send reform but what about the child like lily who need help now every delay be another failed day risk long term harm welcome the investment in education and training outline by the chancellor in yesterday spending review but it be not just school wall that be crumble the system within the building need just as much care investment and resource one headteacher say to of course teacher want to be pay fairly but that not why so many be leave the profession we want well funding for the school for the kid conclude not with the number but with quote from olivia mum constituent of mine olivia be in her month without appropriate educational provision her mum say be increasingly fearful for her future how can she be expect to participate fully in society to reach her potential to build independence to thrive if she be deny even the most basic right to an education the national funding formula must be reassess and make fit for the future over the past decade we have see increase in the number of child identify as require an education health and care plan today we have nearly million pupil in england who be identify as have special educational need unfortunately the rise in demand have not be match by corresponding increase in funding as of october last year the department for education project cumulative deficit of billion in the dedicated school grant by the end of alongside billion gap by between high need cost and current funding level our child have for too long be let down by previous government and we have have year of conservative austerity we must urgently re examine the structure and long term sustainability of our send provision in my constituency the pressure be all too evident nearly pupil be currently receive either special educational need support or have an ehcp around of the total pupil population if we look at the datum more closely stark pattern emerge there be clear correlation between the level of special educational need and the index of multiple deprivation which mean that child in our most deprived area be significantly more likely to require additional support than their peer live in more affluent neighbourhood this be not just matter of education but matter of social justice we must invest in early year intervention and deliver holistic programme of support wolverhampton west be home to five state fund special school tettenhall wood school broadmeadow special school penn fields school penn hall school close to where live and pine green academy be proud of all of they as they have dedicate staff and specialist educate over pupil however even with the tireless effort of our dedicated school staff our state special school be under strain and operate beyond capacity be proud that this government have put forward million for new send place and spend review document reveal that the government will spend million in and million in perhaps my question could go through the hon member to the minister if he do not know the answer the million be very welcome but as he say it be frontloade in one year and then halve the follow year with no indication of where it be go thereafter although it may be welcome short term intervention how be it part of sustainable effort to improve sen my point be that we have not have sufficient funding to provide our special educational need child with the support they require the national audit office have warn that without significant change the current system be financially unsustainable the evidence be damn since we have see no consistent improvement in outcome for child with send we must therefore take bold decisive step to reform our send system to ensure that every child irrespective of their need or background receive the proper support they rightly deserve only then can we say that we have remove the barrier to opportunity before start my speech acknowledge the awful tragedy in india be aware of my own constituent be directly affect by it so my thought and prayer be with they at this difficult time congratulate my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart on secure this important debate have speak many time about education in this place include about my own experience as former governor of school for autistic pupil have always be passionate about ensure that our child and young one can fulfil their full potential early this week be lucky enough to visit one of my send school breakspeare school in abbot langley which be absolutely life change not just for the child that it support and educate but for the family and the wide network associate with those young brilliant individual have two other such school in my constituency colnbrook school and garston manor school but want to focus my comment on breakspeare breakspeare hop to move to different site in croxley in my constituency there have be change of administration at hertfordshire county council but know from the plan of the previous conservative administration that funding would have be put in place for that new school because the current one do not have the capacity to meet the demand associate with it not just in south west hertfordshire but in the wide area the school support predominantly hertfordshire child but also those from buckinghamshire and london be grateful that two fellow hertfordshire mps from across party the hon member for hemel hempstead david taylor and for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria in their place acknowledge that send remain an apolitical but very important issue for all our resident today urge the county council to do all it can to ensure that that school break ground as soon as possible the current location be not fit for purpose not just because it be an old building that be not build for send provision but because the significant demand for such provision in hertfordshire mean that it will quickly be out of date and not able to accommodate sufficient student number hope that the minister will provide not just additional support but go back to my right hon friend early suggestion fair funding for those area that really need it there be perception that hertfordshire be an affluent county but as someone who have not always be base there know it be still significant concern for my resident that across hertfordshire we do not receive the average provision that other county benefit from if the minister be willing and able to speak to treasury colleague be sure she would get cross party support in her long overdue fight to right this wrong we all want to ensure that child in our community do well and fulfil their potential decision on send funding in this parliament directly affect the availability of resource for additional support need education in scotland one of the good experience of my career be work with the pupil parent and teacher at the royal blind school in edinburgh when be at the charity sight scotland there we create happy and supportive environment to help blind and partially sight pupil to reach their goal in education and to gain the vital life skill they need to manage their visual impairment throughout their life such support should be available in every school in every mainstream setting but it simply be not that be because the presumption of mainstreame policy in scotland have not be anything like adequately resource in february of this year audit scotland conclude that the scottish government and council must fundamentally evaluate how education be fund staff and assess to support all pupil include those with additional support need to reach their full potential the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart we very much welcome his securing the debate have mention the disparity in funding between local authority that be an issue in scotland as well repeat poor funding settlement from ministers for our council have result in number of local authority cut additional support need budget again and again the impact on pupil parent and local charity have be dramatic and frankly intolerable the number of pupil who need such support have go up by since but the number of specialist teacher have increase by just sight scotland and rnib scotland have report fall number of specialist teacher for visual impairment the national deaf children society in scotland report decrease in the number of specialist teacher for the deaf the brilliant charity autism rocks which be base in buckhaven in my constituency but support family throughout scotland tell that in one school the number of support staff have be cut from nine to four have see the huge difference that specialist educational support can make for disabled young people specialist teacher give pupil the time and skill they need to have level playing field in the curriculum the brilliant stepping up programme run by enable another charity that have work with help pupil to manage that difficult transition from school to further education or work because of the action of this government we be finally see increase in funding for send and therefore in scotland for additional support need but for two decade snp ministers have preside over crisis in additional support need provision in scotland it be child family and staff who be suffer as result sorry decline in scottish education system of which we be so proud for so long that be why we urgently need new direction in scotland school to ensure that all our child have the support that they need that be their right to achieve their full potential commend the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart for set the scene for we all incredibly well be go to give presbyterian sermon for those who do not know what that be it come in three part first some child thrive academically and other practically some brain think in one way and other in different way we need all of they for function society we need mechanic as well as doctor we need plasterer as much as farmer it take all sort and we need to train child not to fit into standard box but to find the box that fit they that be become increasingly difficult for teacher to manage when the range of child be so wide and the pressure be so extensive hope the hon gentleman agree that under the current model family must first endure an unnecessarily prolong complex and emotionally drain diagnostic process before resource finally begin to trickle in that be reactive approach which not only delay the sense of support but undermine the principle of educational equality and inclusion do he agree that we must recalibrate the system so that diagnostic service be prioritise adequately fund and make accessible locally for every family in need the minister be listen and be sure she will respond positively to the hon lady when the time come sen be not about write off child ability but about ensure that they find their place in the system in order to achieve their potential the second part of my presbyterian sermon be about the stat for northern ireland know they be not the minister responsibility but will give some figure and talk about solution that hope might be helpful in northern ireland sen cost million year but that figure be about less than what be need this year the number of child with special educational need have rise since from some to some in the same period the number of child enrol in special school increase by some funding be not meet need and we must look at other way of do that the department of education in northern ireland be look at unit attach to mainstream school which provide good of both world approach hope that that solution can be of some help the department be look at how well that can enable child to be part of mainstream and well equip to move forward the unit provide additional specialist facility on mainstream school site for pupil with an ehc plan they focus on specific need such as speech language communication or autism the class be small and there be more teacher to help each student the teacher be train to work with pupil in the designate area of need the classroom be adapt to suit pupil need and the pupil spend minimum of and maximum of of their teaching and learn time in the unit join mainstream peer class when appropriate that be one of the solution that northern ireland education ministers and education authority have come up with to try to address the issue when funding be low be conscious of time so conclude by say that perhaps that unit approach be the way forward hope that there will be buy in from staff throughout the united kingdom the goal be uk wide education system that be fit for all and accessible for all need the pressure be great but so too be the reward in teaching and we need to find way to get the great reward for our teacher classroom assistant and all who be involve in school life that can only come with appropriate government support which know the minister be always ready and willing to give for far too long family across my county of staffordshire and indeed across the country have be fail by the very system that be mean to support they the breadth and depth of the crisis in send provision be such that this have to be one of the most if not the most frequently debate topic since the general election since become an mp have speak with dozen of parent who be force to travel long distance often across county border just to get their child the support to which they be legally entitle recently my team help family who have be wait nine month to get into the school of their choice other have be wait for year have hear story of poor communication of document be illegible to parent who feel like outsider navigate system design to exclude they and of family have to repeat their story multiple time due to layer and layer of decision making my constituency of ribble valley sit under lancashire county council which recently receive damn ofsted report for its send provision one parent selina shaw tell that her son monty lose two year of education while the council spend more than on school he never attend as the council do not seem to understand that that school could not meet his need do my hon friend agree that the government and local authority must listen seriously to the voice of the child and to parent to improve send provision and must stop waste precious resource in the immediate term as well as provide the long term financial improvement that the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart propose be sorry to hear about monty story and fear that we will hear story like his from member across the house in this debate it be perfect but shocking example of how the system be so broken that we be waste huge amount of resource money be leak out of system that be already inadequately fund my hon friend be right to highlight that it be awful that we be in such situation child particularly those with high need be have to wake up before dawn and travel for over an hour find themselves exhausted when they reach school that be not choice that be scandal it be not just the child with the most acute need who be suffer many child and young people could thrive with target mid level support if only it be available the number of child with education health and care plan have explode since in reflection of genuine increase in need and great recognition of mental health issue and neurodivergence yet funding have not keep pace result in deficit of around billion in high need budget within local authority welcome the government acknowledgment that the current send system be not fit for purpose and the recent commitment of million to deliver new send place particularly in mainstream school where specialist unit can offer much need support close to home follow yesterday spending review look forward to the school white paper that will come out in the autumn with detail of the government approach to reform the send system we must ensure that the money go where it be truly need share the frustration of the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart as staffordshire be also chronically disadvantage by the outdated funding formula with specialist school in my constituency receive per pupil less not than camden but than the national average fair need base funding system must reflect the actual cost of specialist provision not assumption or average that be partly about the specification of need and the quantification of how we meet it government can be helpful in that first take an interest in the matter as county councillor more than year ago and then as shadow schools minister more recently some year ago the government can provide support through guidance guidance can get right the specification of need and some of the problem that the hon gentleman have describe can be address thank the right hon gentleman for bring his expertise and long experience to the debate be sure that that message have be hear by the minister on the front bench and that she will look into it we must recognise that every child need be different reform must deliver on three major front early intervention so child get support before problem escalate and not after they have already struggle for year inclusive school with proper funding for specialist unit and train staff in every community not just in lucky few and fair access to transport because no child should be deny education due to postcode lottery or long exhaust journey before conclude want to take moment to highlight the number of young people with send who go into employment later in life in staffordshire only of adult with learn difficulty be in pay employment in compare with an average of for all english region be proud to support the government investment for child with additional need but family in cannock chase now need to see change on the ground to see parent and child listen to not dismiss and to see they respect not exhausted we can not build the fair more inclusive country that we all want to see while send family be leave fight for support thank the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart for bring forward the debate and appreciate his speech also appreciate the interest of everybody in the chamber in this matter that stem from our experience on the doorstep where we have meet far too many parent go through hell we see mix of determination frustration helplessness and betrayal they look at and at each hon member and say what be you go to do about it we be not do enough and their comment motivate each of we to be here today to do what we can primary school in my constituency just deal with the as we have alvescot aston and appleton do not have the space and the provision to provide for their child and the send need that be go through the roof in the secondary school it be the same story we have no high need provision in the constituency which mean that lot of child be be taxi god know where far too far away on daily basis which be terrible for the kid and terrible for the whole system for obvious reason economic and otherwise we be desperately try to find route through that and to find solution in oxfordshire we be head for million high need block accumulate deficit this year which be obviously completely unsustainable that be just one county and be sure that it be repeat across all our county to quote the chair of the county councils network we be nine month away from financial cliff edge when these multi billion deficit be place onto council budget book potentially render half of england county and unitary council insolvent overnight oxfordshire county council ask for three thing and think many of we will agree with they the statutory override which will run out in nine month time need to be extend frankly extend it for one year make little sense let we have some perspective and length on this we need write down or write off of the high need block deficit across local authority we need to have some borrowing potential for local authority that need to be explore so that they have flexibility to settle any remain deficit over an affordable period will speak about the deepening funding crisis and the crisis in general for child and young people with special educational need and disability include the failure of our national curriculum to meet the need of all learner since the curriculum reform introduce in we have see return to rigid academic model of education one that might have suit mid century grammar school but fail to deliver for modern comprehensive system the curriculum be simply inaccessible for at least third of our pupil both those with send and many other who thrive with practical creative or vocational learning too many child be be tell implicitly or explicitly that their job be to just get pass and forget about it that be not curriculum that inspire or include it be not curriculum that recognise or nurture diverse talent and it be certainly not curriculum fit for the century it also ignore the cost of adequately educate child with special educational need this narrow focus do more than limit opportunity it damage self esteem confidence and emotional wellbeing it restrict the gift and potential of our young people particularly those who already face the great barrier critically school have lose the flexibility they once have to tailor education to the need of their pupil they be now judge on narrow set of outcome force one size fit all model on to hugely diverse student body again cut price way to deliver our education system that have consequence we can draw direct line from the rigidity of the curriculum to the crisis in school attendance and from there to the rise in neet those not in education employment or training who be vulnerable to exploitation or even to enter the youth justice system as they be exploit by organised crime too many young people with send be be fail by system that offer they no real route to thrive and when school stop be protective factor the risk grow that situation be be make bad by how send funding be distribute local authority be under incredible pressure with funding that simply do not reflect the grow complexity and volume of need we see huge disparity between area and often between school within the same local authority where child miss out on vital support not because their need be different but because of postcode lottery in funding fair and adequate funding be matter of educational justice if we be serious about inclusion we can not continue to under resource the very system mean to deliver it we urgently need to reimagine our education system not as funnel toward academic exam alone but as foundation for every child success in every form it might take hope the minister will listen to the parent carer teacher and young people themselves call for change send provision in our school be in state of deep and grow crisis in my area west sussex county council be already struggle with million send deficit this year figure likely to rise to million by next year that huge figure be one of the bad in the country but what be truly concern be that so much overspend have not even buy we satisfactory service complaint from parent and school have fill my postbag ever since the election only half of ehcp nationally be issue within the legal week timeframe in west sussex it be even bad just now meet the deadline and that be after big push to get the waiting list down it be hard to believe that slow processing be not tactic an ehcp give parent the right to access educational support but that support do not actually exist so the local authority solution be to create deliberate bottleneck in the system so that many family will never get all the way through that be particularly unfair at the nursery level because educational psychologist assessment can take so long that the child be all the way through school before they get one more and more family be force to go to appeal tribunal appeal be up in one year but the fact that council lose almost all those case tell we that thing should never have get that far in the first place in effect that discriminate heavily against parent who for whatever reason be less able to fight their case all the way through the system have meet many parent with sen child and the emotional cost be enormous sometimes feel like myself need counselling afterwards parent have to watch their child drift away from mainstream schooling when early intervention might have save they family be break up under the strain one couple tell that third of marriage do not survive the experience of course the pressure on staff be no less severe our teacher particularly senco be exhausted unsupported and leave the profession one horsham senco tell we be seasoned professional but we be at break point mainstream school face manifest injustice one school tell about child who be refuse by specialist school because their need be say to be too great what happen the child be allocate to an ordinary mainstream primary without any specialist support realise that the demand on the government budget be endless but hope that the current review will lead to swift action any further delay mean we risk lose all the educational progress that teacher have work so hard to deliver over the past year congratulate the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart on secure the debate it be clear that the special educational need and disability system be overstretch underfunded and increasingly out of step with the reality face by child parent and school will share with colleague two local example from bolton west that illustrate the strife that the current system have cause parent one mother jo write to after visit her child school in lostock her child be both bright engaged full of potential and autistic but they be all too often exclude from the very activity design to inspire they when the school organise high profile enrichment trip to london her eld be not choose it be not the fault of the school which be operate under challenge financial constraint rather it be symptom of system that fail to see autistic child as leader or participant in national life after all as jo remind representation be not just about be present but about be expect another mother victoria write to distraught about the possibility that education health and care plan may soon be restrict to child in specialist setting her year old son who have complex need be in mainstream education he can not learn without tailored support his ehcp be not luxury it be lifeline without it he would not be in school without it he would not be learn in bolton alone more than young people have identify send need and over of they rely on ehcp so welcome the billion increase to send and alternative provision that be announce for in the autumn statement last year commend the chancellor for her announcement in yesterday spend review of another million in and million in to reform the special educational need and disability system to make it more inclusive and to improve outcome ahead of publish school white paper in the autumn however can the minister reassure my constituent and that whatever happen with ehcp parent and teacher will be closely consult to ensure the good outcome be secure for child across my constituency and up and down the country be very concerned about the potential knock on effect of any reform for teach assistant from visit school know how vital their role be in ensure child can maximise the time they have to learn in classroom whether it be at ladybridge primary the gates in westhoughton or beaumont primary to name but few know from speak to local head just this morning that the current situation simply can not go on she tell that headteacher be have to go cap in hand outside the school to seek alternative funding and that she have never find it so tough in seven year of be head we owe it to all our child to give they the ability to realise their ambition so hope the minister can address my concern and those of my constituent congratulate the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart on secure this important debate give the limited time that have be allocate will speak about the state of send in my area and then suggest how the government can address some of these challenge the dewsbury and batley constituency sit in the authority of kirklees which rank very low in term of funding per child in the high need block of the dedicated school grant accord to recent report kirklees be the second worst fund council for high need funding per capita kirklee have nearly disabled child and young people between the age of nought and since there have be real term spend cut of on service for disabled child in kirklees give the lack of funding it be not surprising that in june joint send inspection by ofsted and the care quality commission report two priority area of action which as far as be aware be still unresolved without the necessary funding it be extremely difficult if not impossible for the council to address these challenge in kirklees one in eight ehcp be process within the week legal timescale compare with the national average of make it one of the bad rate nationally kirklees be part of the department for education safety valve programme which help local authority with their send deficit but that may pressure council to limit ehcp add barrier for family seek essential support for their child completely agree that the government plan for major send reform be necessary and overdue however current rumour and medium leak have alarm many family the disabled children partnership which represent plus charity royal college and parent group and support early intervention have warn that reform must not disrupt current placement or support arrangement they must not remove ehcp for child with complex or unmet need they must not abolish the send tribunal which be vital legal safeguard they must not remove support after the age of before young people be ready and they must not redefine send in way that narrow eligibility thank the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart for bring this important issue to the chamber for full and thorough discussion want to highlight few issue in suffolk coastal recently have quite large conversation with many parent in my constituency nearly parent fill in my survey and tell the extent of the issue they be face as consequence of battle with special educational need provision some of those who fill in the survey tell that they have have to withhold their child from school for up to year because their child could not access education in setting that be right for they nearly quarter of those child have be off school for over year it will not surprise anyone in this chamber or any parent listen to the debate that many family be struggle with the mental health consequence of this crisis one in two parent tell that they be battle with mental health issue as consequence of their battle with send provision in many conversation that have have across my constituency with school parent and young student we have also explore some of the recommendation that could be bring forward and have speak at length about that in the past we have dual badge in suffolk we be member of and also an area that be be let down regard send our county council be effectively in special measure that be the truth that dare not speak its name it be often the most disadvantaged or poorly educate parent who struggle to navigate complex system middle class parent be at an advantage let we face fact but that be never really recognise and it need to be those people need support and guidance to navigate the system and to get the education that their child rightly deserve could not agree more with the right hon gentleman which be why and so many member be passionate about this issue those who can not articulate or fight for themselves need people to stand up and fight for they in many discussion have have have work with my constituent and with school to come up with six key recommendation that we think will be innovative we know there be funding issue and welcome the government investment and commitment to that however we need to relook at how we deliver special educational need education care and health plan be just one part of the problem but fix those will not fix the situation that parent be face school in saxmundham close down last summer because of the decline population in that area two year after more than million be spend on its send unit it be great facility whose footprint could facilitate primary and secondary education have be urge the government to look at that have write to the minister and will continue to urge the government to look at that provision and take it forward we need national conversation about send and about funding welcome member from across the house talk about the need to bring the voice of parent and young student to that national conversation we must hear from they why it be fail and how adversarial the system have become statistic publish today by the government show that there be more than child with echps but million child without echps who require send support although the million be welcome do the hon member agree that it be drop in the ocean and that the government need to invest more perhaps the hon member will agree with what be about to say which be that yes funding be part of the issue but we need to look at the entire system to solve it at the scale that be need in rural area the right hon member for beverley and holderness speak about this at the beginning of the debate the issue be different to those in urban area there be decline population in many of my primary school one primary school have just student and spare classroom because the population do not match the capacity we have capacity within those school have put forward recommendation which have be support in principle by my county council that where we have decline population in rural area we could operate with special educational need unit alongside mainstream provision act separately but within the same infrastructure that send unit could bid for separate funding and have separate wide catchment area than the primary school what be incredibly exciting about that idea be that the provision do not need to stop in year we know that small cute primary school with tiny population have huge challenge with student move from year into huge class size in secondary school in year if we be to go ahead with the proposal there be no reason why the send unit in primary school could not hold student in year and enable much more gradual transition to secondary school setting that be something have be push passionately have write report about it which publish in my constituency be have load of conversation with my school and will continue to have conversation with the government welcome everyone contribution today thank my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart for secure this important debate it be pleasure to speak on matter so close to the heart of parent carer teacher and pupil in bognor regis littlehampton and across west sussex the urgent need for equitable and sustainable funding for special educational need and disability since the number of ehcp in west sussex have rise dramatically from to in an increase of that surge mirror an england wide trend where the number of ehcp have grow by over since that equate to about additional high need pupil local mainstream school like bishop tufnell and edward bryant report be stretch to capacity they rely on fundraise from charity merely to maintain basic sen provision while increase staff shortage and rise national insurance cost exacerbate burnout nationally high need spending have rise to roughly billion but with pupil number grow fast than funding per pupil support have actually fall by third in real term the government have recognise that pressure capital investment of million aim to support the creation of additional send place include in specialist unit in mainstream school and furth billion be be allocate to support mainstream school placement by under the high need national funding formula however even with that funding expert warn of tick time bomb as council include west sussex face soar deficit that could reach billion by until the council be in surplus but since then the exponential rise in need have put immense pressure on the system have ask the leader of the house to facilitate debate on sustainable model for send funding that ensure that local authority like west sussex receive adequate per head resource that deliver timely funding adjustment as ehcp number grow and that support retention of specialist staff and inclusive practice in mainstream setting urge the house to commit to sustainable and future proof funding as many right hon and hon member have outline there be no doubt that there be crisis in our send system in this country crisis that we inherit from the previous government however funding be still too low to keep pace with the rate at which child be be diagnose with send and many family and teacher be struggle to get the help that child desperately need and deserve unfortunately family in my constituency of south dorset experience the same accord to figure set out early this year of pupil in south dorset receive send support roughly more than the national average that be why want to increase the number of send place in special school setting we have three state fund special school locally harbour school westfield college and wyvern academy whose staff do truly brilliant job deliver specialised and individualised support for every child however follow conversation with mum and dad at the school gate and teacher in the classroom be all too aware that put simply there be more send pupil across south dorset primarily base in mainstream school than there be special send place in special school setting in the department for education say that demand for special school place nationally outstrip available place by at least so do my hon friend agree that we need more special school place completely agree with my hon friend and we really feel that in south dorset there be simply not the place need to support every child with send we urgently need the government to move far fast to ensure that every child with send get the education and the school setting that they deserve once again ask ministers at the department for education to get the send school at the osprey quay site on portland open we wait for year for that to happen under the previous government and to finally rebuild the building at dorset studio school if we can get those two project over the line we can really start to deal with the crisis in south dorset funding for new send school be promise for so many year that be what be most frustrating for parent in my constituency particularly those live on portland in and they be promise solution that do not come and once again we be wait parent on portland need that school on the osprey quay site open as soon as possible every child no matter their educational need should have the opportunity to do their good but they can do that only in the right school with the right support know that this labour government recognise that reality which be why look forward to hear from the department for education on the future of those two school in my constituency and to hear little more from the minister at the end of this debate school in my constituency be among the lowest fund in the country and there be lack of resource for early intervention work before child get to the point of need send support or an ehcp which mean that more child will need high level of intervention later it be vicious circle the lack of money to act early mean that more money must be transfer from the school block to the high need block reduce still far the funding for early intervention south gloucestershire be one of the local authority that enter into safety valve agreement with the previous government it face cliff edge when that agreement end next april and as yet there be no certainty about what come next great deal of work have be do by the council and school work in send cluster but the deficit have continue to increase the agreement be sign pre covid we all know about the impact that the pandemic have on demand for additional support and as result the target in the agreement be completely unachievable safety valve agreement have not work will the government write off those historical deficit and find new fairer funding formula support the government focus on inclusion early intervention and preventive support to make that possible for more child however we need to recognise that there be child and young people already in the system who do not get that support and school need the funding to support they now one of the reason for the historical deficit in south gloucestershire be the lack of specialist place locally which have result in high number of expensive out of area placement those be bad for child who would be well off be educate in their local community so that they do not face excessive travel or need residential place and they be bad for the school budget the hon member make really important point about early intervention the current funding model respond only to high level need and ehcp which lead to an over reliance on costly ehcp and new special school place do she agree that we should look to allocate ringfenced proportion of the high need funding to early intervention in mainstream school that be one approach but we need to ensure that it do not take away from the high need approach the point be that we have to fund both early intervention and the high level need that have result from the lack of early intervention the previous government decline to fund an additional special school placement when they sign the safety valve agreement when meet the minister for school standards she do so too say that the focus be on provide place in the mainstream increase inclusion be sound ongoing policy but pupil can not make the switch overnight we need fairer distribution of capital funding as well as revenue funding another issue with send funding be the notional to give one example headteacher locally tell that more than of their allocation go on the high number of child with ehcp they have on roll leave less than to support all the other child on the record of need school funding do not recognise that there can be great disparity between community and school even in the same local authority area some acquire reputation for be good at support those with additional need and suffer financial consequence and some community in an authority have great need than other the formula for distribute send funding and more general school funding do not reflect that and it mean that school in different part of the country with similar cohort be treat very differently this be clearly national crisis cornwall rank out of local authority for per pupil send funding and child with send need in cornwall get almost half the funding of those in middlesbrough do my hon friend agree that this gross funding unfairness should be urgently address absolutely south gloucestershire be in an even bad position and be sure all the authority in the group would agree yesterday raise with the prime minister one of the impact that lack of support for send have on family he do not take up my request for meeting but hope he will consider meet to discuss this aspect of the issue and meet charity that represent parent who be in this situation of course the lack of support for child with special educational need have many other impact simply do not have time to go into all of they today we need overall send funding to reflect the level of need we need more funding during the transition to great inclusion to reflect the fact that we will be support people with high level of need as well as fund early intervention we need national body for send to end the postcode lottery and to fund the very high need case that cost over year and school need funding to be distribute in way that reflect their need not some overall and potentially flawed perception by their local authority congratulate the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart on secure this debate this be an issue close to my heart use to be school governor as well as college governor and remember set up along with other teacher and professional specific learn unit as well as general learn difficulty unit of course have be constituency mp for the past year this be an issue that have deal with many time and when have be try to assist family have notice that they feel utterly exhausted not only by their caring responsibility but by system that seem to place obstacle in their way my council bolton have make real progress its belong in bolton strategy be help to create more local send place and it be rightly praise in its most recent ofsted and care quality commission inspection in the area cover by salford city council part of which now come into my constituency it now cover walkden the council have also be work really hard to improve provision for child with send but of course all these council have limit resource in bolton alone over child have send issue an increase of since one headteacher in my constituency recently tell that their school spend year on teach assistant to support child with special need but it receive only in education health and care plan funding that leave gap of every single year around of the school total budget which they have to find somewhere that be before we factor in the cost of behaviour support speech and language therapy or educational psychologist we need proper plan that would increase the outdated top up threshold invest in local authority team to ensure that ehc plan be issue on time give family the certainty they need and target capital funding at where demand be great include in bolton south and walkden to make sure that child can get support close to home child in bolton south and walkden need support and that must not be like win lottery call the liberal democrat spokesperson congratulate the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart on secure this vital debate would like to start with the word of berkhamsted student hermione believe without doubt that the school system need to change but more than anything it need to change for sen student because right now it be fail they the system break down completely instead of support the system leave feel isolated and overwhelmed last week meet hermione at egerton rothesay school in berkhamsted she have complex need and have find solace in her new school after year of struggle that be why for her english oral exam she be compel to write piece call the school system need to change especially for sen student she happen to send it to her headmaster on the day visit it be an eloquent piece about her experience and wish have time to share it in its entirety she conclude by say know lucky to have the support do but it still not enough the system need to change not just for but for all the student still be let down and for the future of education itself she call for improved teacher training for more flexible curriculum and assessment for school to listen to send student and for properly fund and staff support would like to tell hermione that parliament be listen and this debate will dive into why that proper funding be so vital and how it can be improve the government must heed the call of parent and child to tackle this issue head on the public accounts committee report in january that despite the increase in the department for education high need fund over the past decade it have not keep pace with demand the current funding model which see top up funding for student require more than year of additional send support have not be update even give the change in real term value that be crippling local school and authority with unitary and county authority have rack up debt exceed billion this year alone that have result in high need spending be consistently high than available funding by between million and million year between and hertfordshire be give the bad rating for send provision under the previous conservative administration the funding formula under the conservatives mean that child in hertfordshire have be burden with the third low per capita funding for high need funding and far less than just next door in buckinghamshire three year old in hertfordshire with send need would have to finish all their formal education before they would get equal funding to similar child in buckinghamshire the new government must stop this postcode lottery as eloquently put forward by the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart and ensure that those previously leave behind get the support they need kyle family in markyate tell that the system treat they not as kid with hope and dream but as just another name on piece of paper jess in tring make the difficult decision to remove their six year old from school to home educate and tell that see their five year old struggling be heartbreaking those be not isolate case they reflect the story across constituency up and down the country the real consequence of underfunding and the postcode lottery of unfair distribution the liberal democrats have clear plan to fix this break system we call on the government to establish national send body to end this postcode lottery and to fully fund cost above per annum ensure that child with complex need receive the tailored support they require to increase funding for local authority to reduce the financial burden on school after the conservatives leave local council underfunde to extend the profit cap from child social care to send to provide cash towards the cost of ehcp to tackle the disincentive create this adversarial system and to reform that break national funding formula this crisis can not go on every child no matter their need deserve the opportunity to succeed with the right support in place the government must urgently clarify their reform plan send family deserve certainty not to be drip feed information about their child future as hermione say to anyone who think the system work fine as it for who if it do work for all then it do truly work call the shadow minister it be pleasure to follow such excellent contribution from member from all part of the house in this important debate congratulate my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart on secure this vital debate pay tribute to the parent the carer the school and all those who have battle tirelessly to secure funding for send student be one of those send student who benefit from my parent tirelessly campaign for to have the disability support need in school it have only take this long to finally say thank you such support play vital role in child long term success member from all part of the house have raise this issue today because they can see the merit in fighting for child chance particularly in primary school to increase their success overall we know that find the right provision can be difficult and bureaucratic for child with send and their family secure the right assessment of child need get their education health and care plan and find the right provision take huge effort and far too long many parent who have come to have be absolutely choke and suffocate by the system too often child with send face postcode lottery with suitable provision too far from their home or in the bad case no suitable provision at all accord to the datum we now have million child who have be identify as have send of all school pupil we know that the number have grow significantly over the last few year which be why the conservatives open new specialist school commit to further and deliver over new special need school place the growth in child with send be why get the distribution of funding correct really do matter we know that not enough of the funding be reach school and the child who need it the most we know that as the number of child with send have increase the deficit from the high need block have become financially unsustainable as many member have allude to today that be why we must confront the challenge face local government when the statutory override end in march and we would like to hear what assurance the minister can give on how council can address the deficit as expect my hon friend be make powerful and compelling case will she also ask the minister to address the issue of special need not be static many need be dynamic child change when their need change and that dynamism need to be build into the system so that flexible funding can follow need thank my right hon friend for make that excellent point many member have raise this issue and perhaps we can have another debate in government time on how send funding can follow the student rather than just have it allocate the need of send student will change over time which be why parent often change educational provider child may go into independent school setting and then come back to state setting and parent be constantly battle the system it be worth look at whether we can have model in which the funding follow the student many parent have come to and be sure to other member to ask for vat not to be charge on independent school fee because over pupil with send who be be support in that educational setting now have to go back into the state sector which can not cope with rise cost and the number of student enter the system ask the government to urgently look at that and to turn on the policy of charge vat on school fee because send child be fall through the crack as result for send student in primary school it be very important that they have educational support through teacher primary school teacher be some of the most important teacher they change my life and help cope with my disability and would not be here today if have not have they the government claim that they would recruit more teacher but we have now hear that they will not do so the truth be that there be now few teacher than there be year ago promise have be make but this promise seem to have be break however it be even bad than that when it come to send primary school play vital role but this government have have to quietly drop primary school teacher from their promise to recruit teacher and honestly want to know why that be primary school be where child with hidden send will first present if there be early intervention the journey to provide they with the right support be much easy have that support yield high level of return but if it be not put in place in time we see high level of exclusion and ultimately see child disengage from education and learning do the hon member agree that the problem begin even early nursery receive no dedicated send funding which mean that essential early intervention be provide by school and the funding be overstretch that be neither sustainable nor fair for the child or for the school try to support they the hon member make wonderful point about the fact that early intervention be underfunde but such funding actually reap huge benefit for student should declare that work at the centre for social justice where we look at early intervention as one of the most important way of turn around the life of child especially for child with special educational need early diagnosis and early intervention can make all the difference in their not fall behind when they enter main education it be rare that support additional funding but do for early intervention because it be life change the year during which we can change child life be those from four to seven it be such small window during which we can erase trauma and help with any disability but that will help they for the rest of their life so early intervention make all the difference for such child in the long term ask the government to listen to listen to the child family and school tell they that send funding be not make it to the child who need it to listen to the local authority that need clarity urgently on the future of high need block and the statutory override to listen to the parent of child at independent school who be be rip from setting that work for they because of an education secretary who will not listen to the evidence that those school be the right place for those student at this time and to listen to the primary school that be now short of teacher but be try to provide send support for these child at the most vital stage of their education it be time for the government to listen and to make the change our child with send so desperately need congratulate the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart on secure this debate on this important subject know he have strong interest in special educational need and disability and commend he for his year of advocate for change he speak widely about many area but especially about distribution also thank the many member across this chamber for their passionate and sincere speech which all advocate for their constituent and the child they care about among the many member who have speak my hon friend the member for huddersfield harpreet uppal talk about the difficulty for parent navigate send the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty speak about the challenge involve ehcp my hon friend the member for hemel hempstead david taylor give some case study and like other members mention these precious child and their experience which be all very vital and pertinent to this debate thank they for those case study about grace olivia hermione and other which really appreciate and acknowledge my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss speak about the government invest in early year and that be absolutely what we be do will seek to address as many as possible of the issue and challenge that have be raise and bring to my attention but again thank my hon friend the member for south dorset lloyd hatton for his strong advocacy for sen provision in his area which have be note however will push back against the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey who raise many issue to be address gently say to she that give the past year we do not need to be in this position with send we do not need to be here and this government have be leave to fix the foundation we do have plan for change and will mention as many of the area as can the government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity and give every child the good start in life that mean ensure that all child and young people receive the right support to succeed in their education and to lead happy healthy and productive adult life will the minister give way would like to make some progress before begin to give way member from across the house will be aware of the challenge face the send system system that be difficult for parent carer and young people to navigate and where outcome for child be often poor that have be mention by many member the education committee have undertake its own inquiry aim at solve the send crisis which underscore the significant challenge we face improve the send system be priority for this government we want all child to receive the right support to succeed in their education and to lead happy healthy and productive adult life the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins quote hermione who say that send need to work for all and just want to acknowledge that be grateful to the minister for give way she will be aware that the title of this debate despite what it say on the screen be distribution of send funding hope therefore that she will focus primarily on that particular technical point the distribution of send fund across the country be accord to and campaigner across the house unfair break and need to change be that the government view and the minister view that be the first answer and then we can turn to how it can well be fix the most important thing be to recognise whether it be break or not feel it be unfair and broken and would like to hear the minister say so if she agree hear the right hon gentleman point but he do need to allow time to proceed it would be wrong of not to also respond to other member from across the chamber who have mention concern with regard to the reason we be here member across the house will be aware of the challenge face the send system improve the send system be priority for this government as say we want all child to receive the right support we be prioritise early intervention and inclusive provision in mainstream setting we know that early intervention prevent unmet need from escalate and that it support all child and young people to achieve their goal alongside their peer these be complex issue that need consider approach to deliver sustainable change and we have already begin that work we launch new training resource to support early year educator to meet emerge need and announce far fund training place for early year special educational need co ordinator in the financial year which will be target at setting in the most disadvantaged area we have extend the partnership for inclusion of neurodiversity in school programme to support an additional mainstream primary school to well meet the need of neurodiverse child in the financial year that investment build on the success of the programme which be deliver to over primary school last year we have already establish an expert advisory group for inclusion to improve the mainstream educational outcome and experience of those with send all that work form part of the government opportunity mission which will break down the unfair link between background and opportunity we will continue to work with the sector as essential and value partner to deliver our share mission and to respect parent trust as my hon friend the member for cannock chase josh newbury mention parent need to be respect not exhausted the department be provide an increase of billion for the high need budget in england in the financial year total high need funding for child and young people with complex send be over billion for the year return to the right hon member for beverley and holderness of that total east riding of yorkshire council be be allocate over million through the high need fund block of the dedicated school grant an increase of million on the high need block be calculate use the high need national funding formula the nff allocation be increase per head for the two to year old population on the equivalent nff allocation will turn to the many issue raise by other member we know that family face issue with education health and care plan and that even after fight to secure the entitlement support be not always deliver quickly enough ehc plan should be issue within week and be quality assure for combination of statutory requirement local authority framework and good practice guideline but the late publication datum show that just half of new ehc plan be issue within the time limit in where local authority do not meet its duty on timeliness and quality of plan we can take action that prioritise child need and support local area to bring about rapid improvement this government believe that complex legal process should not be necessary to access good early support for child and young people which be why we need to focus on address the overall systemic issue to make send support easy to access we be continue to develop the way in which we protect support for the child who will always need specialist placement and make access that support less bureaucratic and adversarial do the minister acknowledge that early support must be give to child when they be at nursery if we identify those need at that point we could save money in the long run the government be very much committed to early intervention and prevention work it be strongly suggest the other day that the government be go to look at change ehcp and possibly even scrap they completely can the minister give some reassurance to the house and to constituent who may be watch this debate that ehcp will remain extant and will be work on as far as be aware ehc plan will continue we know that child early year make the big difference to their life chance as have already say we believe in early intervention and recognise the importance of high quality early year education and care which can lead to well outcome for child have access to formal childcare setting allow child need to be identify at the early opportunity so that the appropriate support and intervention can be put in place to allow child with send to thrive arrangement be in place to support child with send to access government funding in early education include funding for disability access and special educational need inclusion and the high need nff allocation to support local authority we be review early year send funding arrangement to assess how suitable the current arrangement be for support the need of child with send the additional funding for school of more than billion year over the next three year announce in the spending review will provide an above real term per pupil increase in the core school budget take per pupil funding to its high ever level and enable we to transform the send system we will improve support for child stop parent have to fight for support and protect the support that be currently in place detail of the government intend approach to send reform will be set out in the school white paper in the autumn the government will also set out further detail on support local authority as we transition to reform system as part of the upcoming local authority funding reform consultation the point be make early about rural area my county of lincolnshire have sparsely distribute population which make travel and access difficult for parent of child with special need will the minister address that in the new funding formula to ensure that rural area do not lose out thank the right hon gentleman for his question as have already say the government intend to set out our send reform in the school white paper in the autumn will make sure that further response be also provide to the right hon gentleman on that point the investment in the spending review be critical step forward in our mission to support all child and young people to achieve and thrive and to support teacher and leader to deliver high and rise standard across every school for every pupil on travel which have be raise by many member across the chamber local authority must arrange free travel for child of compulsory school age who attend their near school and can not walk there because of the distance their send or mobility problem or because the route be not safe there be additional right to free travel for low income household to help they exercise school choice where child have an ehcp the school name in the plan will usually be consider their near to home for school travel purpose we know how challenging home to school travel be for local authority at the moment that be due in large part to the pressure in the send system itself central government funding for home to school travel be provide through the local government finance settlement administer by the ministry of housing communities and local government the final settlement for make available over billion for local government which be cash term increase in council core spending power for we have commit to improve inclusivity and expertise in mainstream school so that more child can attend local school with their peer this will mean that few child will need to travel long distance to school that can meet their need which will reduce pressure on home to school travel over time mean that we will be well able to meet the need of those who still need to rely on it madam deputy speaker be sure you want to draw to close reiterate that the government be urgently look at reform the send system so that it well serve child and young people and their family we have note all the contribution that have be make this afternoon this will take time but we be work at pace and will be set out our plan to do that in the white paper in the autumn member can rest assure that our approach be root in partnership and that all our work will be guide by what child their family expert leader and frontline professional tell we we can transform the outcome of young people with send only if we listen and work together on solution call graham stuart to wind up thank all colleague for come to the chamber on this thursday afternoon because this issue be just so important we have hear really interesting and reflective speech from right across the house as member have seek to champion the child who probably most need help in our society so it be right that we should be here thank the minister for her response be slightly disappointed because the title of this debate be distribution of send funding and it be important to ask whether the distribution be right do the government think that it be or that it be not do not think that the system be defensible as it be and it would be good to hear that say once one have recognise that the system be break and unfair the next question be how shall we fix it we do not get an answer to that because we do not get an answer to the first question the minister response morph into what we talk about generally which be sen overall what the government be do the billion extra and all the other thing many of which be welcome but the question underneath that be whether the distribution be right if it be not be we go to do something about it while make these other change we do not get an answer to that my appeal to the minister think colleague across the house will welcome this might even get nod from some on the government benches be to make sure that in the white paper there be an opportunity to make the distribution fair if not immediately then at least over time we must recognise the problem and look to level up over time that be not to penalise those who might be technically overfunde today but to make sure that every child have fair and well chance of get whatever we can well provide from the system that be an important element of the overall discussion about send we will doubtless hear more about this topic the minister do not seem absolutely clear whether ehcp be here to stay resist my own stricture on stick to the subject of distribution will use the few second that have leave to talk about the ehcp system when child get an ehcp they get well outcome perhaps that be drive parent to push their child to get one and that may be contribute to the financial unsustainability of the system that we have today it would be enormously controversial to look to remove it at the moment we have system that from to be increase by the government be put in another billion and another million be announce yesterday and that be welcome but if we do not find way of stabilise the system we will still have those who be sharp elbowed get something for their kid and those who be not lose out that be not system that anyone across the house should be satisfied with question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the distribution of send funding covid fifth anniversary bet to move that this house have consider the fifth anniversary of the pandemic start by thank the hon member for harrow east bob blackman and the backbench business committee for grant my request for this debate also thank all hon member who support my application approach the committee because it be important that we mark the fifth anniversary of the pandemic it be an extraordinary time in our life and for the nation in some way it feel like dream five year on it seem hard to believe that we actually go through such period of disruption the impact have be huge and long last even if we do not acknowledge that on day to day basis should say that do not intend to talk about and neither do hope this debate become about the origin of the pandemic the way it be handle personal protective equipment the then government or any of the inquiry or legality there will be plenty of time for those discussion and no doubt this house will have plenty of opportunity to talk about those thing in future want this debate to be about people and community we lose lot of people to covid and the impact on those who lose love one be significant it cut across community age and faith most of we will have have covid all of we will know someone who have be affect many of we will know people who die and will understand the impact of the grief and loss combine with the shock of pandemic there be funeral unattended and people who have to die alone as the current prime minister say at the time people be frighten by the strangeness anxious about what will happen next and we have to remember that every number be family shake to its foundation it be not just those we lose whom we must remember the country keep go through the incredible hard work and bravery of our frontline workforce but it also carry on because of school community group place of worship volunteer and people just be good neighbour without they we could not have keep go know from experience in my community that the work of volunteer be vital they put their community first above and beyond their own need as do our frontline worker from those in the nhs and care home to bin man social worker the emergency service and transport worker to name just few there be danger as we get into the politic and the legality that we will forget the many worker on whom we quietly rely or that we will allow their contribution to be underappreciated they deserve to be recognise and for their effort to be applaud during the lockdown be member of the newham council cabinet with responsibility for much of the public realm include waste and recycling remember the poster attach to the wheelie bin thank the bin man for their work and for come out during the lockdown to clear rubbish in normal time we perhaps do not think about the people who collect our bin other than to curse little if it be an early morning collection or mildly panic on realise that it be bin day and the bin have not be put out in this time of stress the role they play be emblematic of so many of our key worker and it be great to see resident share their appreciation across newham over resident volunteer their time with the council helpnewham initiative to support the borough most vulnerable there be also more than covid champion who help to distribute information and advice to their community during the pandemic to keep people inform those be the people who make such difference and provide vital support to the local council at time when it be stretch by deliver vital service in borough with high number of vulnerable people and high rate of infection and casualty we often talk about the number but it be important that we understand the sheer scale of the impact that the pandemic have on our community my borough lose more than people to covid it be one of the worst hit place in the country and at the beginning of the pandemic it be the worst affect place in the uk it be extremely easy to lose sight of the impact when we talk about the number and the large the number the great the danger that it become statistic and the individual behind it be lose behind those number be real people real story and real life and we must never forget that that be back up with story of compassion and kindness from family friend and nhs doctor and nurse it be vital we find way for their name and face to be remember and for their family to gain comfort from that memory the inspiration for this debate come from my staff during visit to plaistow park it be there that newham have create its permanent memorial to covid in the middle of the crisis be certain that we would need to find way to mark it for local people it be clear from the scale of the pandemic and the life lose that there would be national and regional memorial indeed newham host the london blossom garden memorial for london in the olympic park which be in the constituency of my neighbour and hon friend the member for stratford and bow uma kumaran the national memorial wall have also offer much to many people give the impact on newham however we need something dedicated to our local people monolithic memorial feel wrong this be not war memorial it need to be something that reflect the nature of the people who be impact it need to be memorial for all young or old single or with family religious or not it have to be space for everyone what be design be memorial garden in one of our park create with the help of our park team landscape architect and local artist matt ponting importantly it be create in consultation and discussion with local people and design to work for all in our community it be landscaped area in previously little use part of plaistow park in my constituency in the centre of our borough with tree and flower seating and its own path and work of art in which people can sit quietly pray reflect or enjoy it with other on the day of its opening in more than local people turn out include one local resident who have lose his father still grieve the loss his appreciation for have place that he could visit and that mean that his father and those who die have not be forget be something that strike and that remember vividly all politician hope that they will have legacy and we all have idea of what we might like to achieve do when start as councillor and even realise some of they but if have to leave just one thing behind think it would be that garden sadly there be no database of memorial and no online guide to what have be put in place but we will all know of something that have be do to recognise the impact of covid we need to create some form of guide or register so we can ensure that such memorial be not lose for the future we know that good work have be do research the background to this debate come across some wonderful example such as memorial garden in telford oldham and enfield memorial woodland in wokingham and hornchurch and memorial mosaic in barrow hope we will hear more example from hon member this afternoon these space be vital not just for now but for the generation that come after we we can not allow the legacy of the pandemic to be the preserve of documentary textbook and history lesson it should be legacy root in our community celebrate the sacrifice and contribution that be make and remember those who be no long with we not as the statistic they be record by but by the life they live this year be the anniversary of the beginning of the blitz which start in my constituency it be in the east end of london that the phrase blitz spirit which we still use emerge spirit of stand firm and work together as community we see in how strongly that still exist and when the chip be down the strength of our community perhaps we should now be talk about pandemic spirit and talk with pride about how that spirit shine through across our community today hope that we can contribute to that spirit in this house hope the debate will provide comfort for those who be remember love one hope it help to ensure that all who go out to work to keep thing go in those difficult day get their recognition hope it help to shine light on the army of volunteer who step up and help when it be need most rise order colleague can see how many member wish to contribute there will be speak limit of three minute thank the hon member for west ham and beckton james asser for secure the debate and for the eloquent and passionate way in which he speak agree that it have be hard prepare for this debate because in many way think we have still to come to term with what happen for it be particularly strange as new mp as be at the start of arrive in this place expect everything to be see debate and understand through the lens of brexit because that be how it have be in the recent year up to that point just three month after my election we see covid and national lockdown and everything change recruit staff hand they laptop and do not know when would see and engage with they again this place be diminish too the benefit of develop cross party relationship be so valuable and we do not realise that until there be no opportunity for it in the same way the hon member for west ham and beckton thank those in his community recognise the staff here who do so much to facilitate the sitting of this house and the work that need to be do every day as come here walk past the national covid memorial on couple of occasion have see people update or enhance some of the fading that have take place and it be important that we do that the memorial be across from this place and we take this moment to remember the plus people who die from in the uk the memorial be daily poignant reminder of the cruel devastating and terrifying disease that covid be especially in those early month for those affect the pain of that loss be still acute as scottish mp want to touch on how policy response to the pandemic highlight that often we do not have four nation thinking and decision making in those early day everything be align and we see the strength of intergovernmental thinking and decision as hard as it be there be one set of rule and they apply everywhere there be no doubt however that as time go on the rule get more complex inside outside work two metre rule of six and tier and they differ between the four nation have to have covid app for scotland and for england and occasionally get ping in different place by different app another example from my constituency be the impact on golf and tourism and that include the impact of the different rule we need to learn those lesson and be pleased to see that there be well intergovernmental work between the scottish and uk government however where we have different policy response we always need to ensure that they be good they be clear and they be for the right reason commend my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser for secure this debate the pandemic have global reach yet the impact be not feel equally on local level the pandemic have disproportionate impact on some of the most vulnerable in society the elderly those with pre exist condition and people live in the most deprive area see some of the high fatality rate the pandemic in the uk and globally display for all to see or all who care to see the damn consequence of societal and economic inequality globally be estimate to have directly cause million death and many million more indirectly the global response be unequal and unjust with many country starve of essential vaccine test and treatment though some speak of as be once in lifetime event that be not necessarily true key way of honour those who die those who be leave bereaved and those who suffer in so many way be to focus on have plan for the next pandemic study suggest that outbreak cause by disease move from animal to people be happen more often and with great impact that say there be reason for hope in that area number of initiative and project be work to ensure that the next outbreak do not catch we unprepared one example be the days mission which be global initiative that aim to have safe effective and accessible vaccine test and treatment within day of the next pandemic it be estimate that have the world deploy vaccine test and treatment within day for covid rather than within day we could have prevent million excess death and avoid trillion in economic loss it be welcome that the uk government continue to support that mission and more general global health research and development research in that area and in so many other be so important we live in an age where some decry expert suggest that we need more expertise research and science not less we need to remember those who suffer and those who die and we need to mark that by commitment to ensure that we be well place than ever before for any such eventuality in the future pay tribute to the hon member for west ham and beckton james asser for secure the debate which take place five year after sweep across the country it be right that we take moment to reflect not only on what we have lose but the duty we have to those who continue to carry the burden of the pandemic today speak for some of the family who catch covid and never recover for they the pandemic be not history chapter from their past it be still very much with they today speak particularly for those in my constituency who do the right thing follow the rule take the vaccine and be harm in particular want to share the story of adam bounds who come from axminster he be year old he be devoted father hard work man and deeply love by his family on may he receive his first dose of the astrazeneca vaccine and day later he die of vaccine induce thrombotic cytopenia which be rare but now medically recognise side effect essentially blood clot my constituent adam father leslie have fight dignified and determined campaign to get compensation for adam son his grandson through the vaccine damage payment scheme it have take two year and considerable stress and anxiety the family have now receive the payment and leslie have deal with it all cause he an enormous amount of trauma frankly two year of form fill chase department and relive that awful historic period if we want people to have faith in vaccine and do we must ensure that we have proper function compensation system that be swift supportive and responsive to the need of grieve family justice be about not only those who die but those who live with the aftershock in devon people be report to have long covid my hon friend speak passionately about an issue that also affect constituent of mine such as anna in harpenden year old who live with long covid she have headache and stomach issue day in day out do he agree that we need to have covid register and care pathway to ensure that those live with the consequence of covid be properly look after my hon friend be absolutely right covid register make good sense she mention symptom and those can also include tiredness struggle for breath memory problem and heart palpitation we should remember that many of the people affect by long covid be the very people who take the brave decision to expose themselves right at the beginning they be the people we pay tribute to such as care worker shop assistant health staff and teacher those who keep society go while other be isolate last month be speak with resident in sidmouth and meet constituent who share the impact that long covid continue to have on his daughter she be somebody who be hard work and determine but now find that her energy have almost vanish she be unable to work and be often confine to her bed and her social life have disappear like thousand of other across the uk she face the potential hammer blow of the government propose welfare reform most people with fluctuate invisible condition like long covid or will not be eligible as we understand for personal independence payment under the new assessment accord to the office for national statistics of adult say they have experience long covid at some point if we want society that be prepare for the next crisis we must learn the lesson of the last one we owe it to leslie bounds and other in sidmouth and to everyone across the country who suffer from covid thank my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser for secure this debate we have rightly speak about those who die during the pandemic but covid also do something else it make it much hard for people to earn decent living those who be already struggle the low pay the young and people in place outside london suffer the most first covid hit low pay people in job such as bartende which could be do only in person because they require complex manual movement while those in high pay job could use zoom to reach the office the low pay be hit and far more likely to be lay off or place on furlough secondly the young fall behind while the wealthy baby boomer continue to pull ahead in the two decade lead up to covid house price go up by while wage grow by only that be why the young can not afford home during the pandemic quantitative easing low interest rate and pensioner not spend cash mean that baby boomer start to buy home again and house price be up since covid begin while some of to year old be live at home with mum and dad thirdly london continue to pull ahead zoom to work enlarge london effective size while place outside the capital lose out more and more people and economic activity be suck into the capital the people who already could not make end meet be pull away not only from mainstream party but from this house itself the economically insecure be more likely to have stop support the labour party but they be also leave almost every party in this house we can reshape our nation so that everyone can earn enough but we will do it only if the government act for the low pay we must invest to create good job and to get bill down for the young we must build far more home for the rest of the nation we must invest outside london we be at this moment nation deeply divided and the pandemic widen those division thousand of self employ people and business owner be exclude from government support because of the arbitrary eligibility criterion they pay their taxis but be leave unsupported during the crisis do the hon member agree that it be disappointing that those people be still struggle five year on indeed huge number of people be hit so hard during the pandemic we agree that although support be broad it certainly be not perfect on top of the suffering the pandemic widen exist inequality and division in our nation those who could not earn enough the low pay the young and people outside london be hit the hard they be already turn away from we in this house they be now turn away more quickly we can bring they back only if we act to ensure that every single person can earn enough for decent life if we create nation in which we recognise that our strength be found in each of we do well nation of unity common purpose and connection it be for we to build that nation as my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton rightly note thank my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser for secure the debate and for his tribute to public service worker we should never forget that in place like edinburgh everyone from bus driver to bin lorry driver take huge risk at the start of the pandemic because the consequence and transmission of the virus be not understand at this point must mention my lovely wife who work in end of life care as nurse all the way through as well as the fantastic hannah in my office who work in care home covid have not disappear the fantastic covid memorial wall across the river from this building tell we that the number of heart on it be slowly grow hope that when she respond the minister will give we an update on any plan to make the memorial permanent and acknowledge the fantastic work of the friend of the wall covid have not go away yet in one week alone in scotland last year people be hospitalise with covid long covid be now just as prevalent as stroke chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and atrial fibrillation thank my hon friend for bring up long covid the organisation long covid kids which be found by my constituent sammie mcfarland highlight the experience of young people with long covid do he agree that we must ensure we give long covid the consideration it need alongside other illness when we develop health policy even though we be five year on from the pandemic absolutely hope will be able to expand on that in the time have remain but that organisation sound fantastic so thank my hon friend for mention it one of the most powerful thing about be an mp be the people we meet particularly in our constituency one of those people be sophie who attend my surgery in the fantastic fountainbridge library her story starkly portray the reality of live with long covid sophie enjoy full and active life before the pandemic she use to run to her office in the morning where she oversee small dedicated team of designer be sure she be not too sweaty after her run to work she now rely on wheelchair to get around and be largely housebound she say be desperate to get back to my career and live again but doctor have be unable to help she sophie be one of small but grow number of constituent who write to with story that highlight the seemingly irreversible impact that covid infection have have on their life with no prove treatment or cure in sight we can not afford to treat covid as old news we need to keep talk about it and particularly about those people who be suffer from long covid it should not be an economic argument but the impact of long covid on our economy be significant it be estimate to cost we billion up to as long as treatment option remain limited and new patient continue to join the thousand already grapple with long covid on daily basis we need to do just three thing to help they and reduce the burden on our nhs we need to empathise with those who have this condition and treat it seriously too often they be see as work the system and know through the people have meet that that be completely untrue we need to invest in new trial and research and we need to recognise that while the threat of covid may have diminish we have to take it seriously and ensure that vulnerable group be vaccinate declare my interest in this debate as chair of the all party parliamentary group on vulnerable group to pandemic stay at home protect the nhs save life it be almost surreal five year on to say those word aloud today most of we have never hear of social distancing or imagine britain under lockdown overnight vibrant community turn still our high street once fill with life and laughter become eerily silent like scene from hollywood sci fi but this be not fiction it be our shared reality the consequence be real and the sacrifice immeasurable today as we reflect on that time we carry duty to not just remember but learn the lesson for the future for many of we the covid pandemic feel like closed chapter the lockdown have end the pub be open the mask be off and life have almost return to normal but for over million people across the uk normal never really return those be people who be immunocompromise they can not mount an effective response to mrna messenger ribonucleic acid vaccine the very tool that pull so many of we out of lockdown the vaccine simply do not work for they that mean today in they be still live with the same risk that the elderly and clinically vulnerable face in those terrifying month in they be still shield still isolate and still leave behind and the toll on those people and their family be appalling recent report by the campaign group forgotten live uk find that of family member of immunocompromise patient be still shield to protect their love one three quarter of those family be in the clinical range for anxiety and depression half of all patient be miss medical appointment and third be face financial hardship know the secretary of state have meet with immunocompromise patient and representative from the forgotten live uk group welcome that engagement and echo its call for well support however must express my disappointment as chair of the all party group on vulnerable group to pandemic write to the previous minister and the current minister ask they to meet and those immunocompromise patient to date have not receive response so would be grateful if the minister would follow up on that matter directly in conclusion be flip through my well prepared speech madam deputy speaker we need whole government approach to address this issue and tangible assistance to help people reintegrate into work and public life and we need to educate society about the risk that continue to pose to compromise individual rise order we will not get everybody in unless drop the time limit again down to two minute congratulate my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser on secure this debate so that we can learn from the covid year first pay tribute to the amazing health worker volunteer and key worker who support we through that turbulent time and will focus my brief contribution on the often overlook impact that covid have on maternity service and pregnancy and on the live experience of woman we know that woman be shut out of the high level of decision making during the pandemic and their voice be sideline research from the london school of economics and political science find that the conservative government consistently fail to consider gender in their response to during covid the maternal mental health alliance report sharp rise in maternal anxiety and the already concern gap in perinatal mental health service widen far informed support network which be so vital to new mother be decimate by lockdown and restriction the withdrawal of home birth service and the closure of midwife lead unit during the pandemic curtail woman autonomy over how and where to give birth that shift see many woman force to deliver in hospital where be actively be treat heighten the health risk for mother and newborn post natal service also suffer immensely coalition of pregnancy and baby charity give evidence about and they speak about the way that the need of mother and new parent be consistently overlook in critical healthcare decision for instance one year assessment be do by video call there be lack of replacement for in person baby class and there be no health visitor or community practitioner we be run short of time so in conclusion remind the house that roughly million baby be bear during the uk pandemic year and all those child have mother who have to face that time alone confused and forget we owe it to every parent midwife and newborn to ensure that never happen again let that be our legacy not just remembrance but the resolve to build health system that be resilient compassionate and prepared the next generation deserve to be welcome into world that have learn from its past and strive for well congratulate my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser on secure this debate it may be five year since the pandemic begin but those year cast long shadow regrettably the effect will be feel for many year to come across my constituency in and around bolton the pandemic leave deep scar with thousand of life tragically cut short those be not number on board or figure on screen they be neighbour parent sibling child mum and dad aunt and uncle family friend and love one their memory must be honour not just with fine word in the chamber today but in our commitment to learn the lesson from the covid pandemic so that never again do we find ourselves wholly unprepared for public health emergency we would be do all those people who lose or risk their life huge disservice if we do not learn the lesson of the pandemic so implore the minister hope we will make progress on this to look at how it be possible that our frontline worker be send into battle against the virus without adequate personal protective equipment there be ppe that be deem unfit for purpose ppe that be not deliver in timely manner and ppe that be not manufacture to nhs requirement ppe contract award by the previous government mean that million of pound of taxpayer money be squander through cavalier approach to procurement and serious question be raise about integrity probity and value for money five year after covid first hit these shore these issue continue to wind their way through our court of course the government need to act at speed nobody deny that but what go on be in my view inexcusable lead anti corruption charity transparency international uk produce report behind the mask which find total of high risk contract total billion many of those be award without competitive tender and be rush in bournemouth christchurch and poole up to people die because of covid and many in my constituency be live with grief trauma and long covid when speak to gps they be rightly pleased with and proud of their role in vaccinate our town and country but they feel that this role have be forget do my hon friend agree that we must remember the contribution of our gps as vaccinator and send the signal that this house thank they welcome my hon friend contribution we should thank not just gps but all the key worker who be vital in ensure that our country could keep go and who keep we safe during those terrible year return to the point about government procurement the vip lane disproportionately favour company with political connection rather than prioritise value for money or capability to deliver the national audit office find that supplier on the vip list be time more likely to secure ppe contract from the government than those who come through the ordinary lane that would be all well and good if those contract have provide any sort of value for money but the good law project reveal that such contract be more expensive than other supplier be indeed some contract be agree at more than four time the average unit price to close in order to truly honour the legacy of the hundred of thousand who tragically lose their life in the pandemic we must act on the lesson learn during those awful few year we must ensure that there be proper government procurement system that can secure public trust hon member have mention the memorial wall on the bank of the thames opposite this place on which heart denote individual we lose during want to mention one of those individual my grandad bill we lose he in june five year ago next week he go into hospital with something else but he contract covid on the ward and he pass away he die on his own in hospital bed none of we be allow to see he because we be follow the rule and the next time see he he be in coffin in an empty church the reason remember that date in june so viscerally be not only because we lose my grandad in way that mean it be impossible to properly grieve but because on that very same day the then prime minister have birthday party in no many people across this house and this country will have story like that while we follow the rule make sacrifice and lose people other act with impunity do not want to make my comment party political know that there will be conservative members who will also feel angry about what happen but as we mark this anniversary hope all of we commit to ensure that the bond of trust between politician and the public be rebuild and be never again fray and break in such fundamental way in the remain second that have pay tribute to all our key worker everyone in our nhs and all our community particularly those in middlesbrough south and east cleveland they come together during that pandemic as we always have in time of hardship but in way that we have never see before in the time have available will focus on education and care provision during the pandemic be serve as north lanarkshire chair of education when the scottish government direct the closure of school in march within day the entire country be lock down and we move to home schooling and virtual lesson do my hon friend share my concern for the child in all our constituency who after lose nearly two year of face to face schooling be still suffer set back in their learning and their social skill will he join in call on the government to channel investment into those who be at school during those year of disruption to ensure that there be not lost generation in this country my hon friend be absolutely right the uk government be invest significantly in skill and apprenticeship for some of those young people who be impact by the pandemic and we need to see that in scotland as well for child transition from early year to primary and from primary to secondary it must have feel like experience an alternative universe give social distancing the expansion of digital learning and the use of ppe sadly despite the good effort of those on the frontline young people lose learning and we have to tackle that head on however they show resilience sadly that resilience and those effort be trample on when the scottish government seek to downgrade the higher result of child from my local authority area some of young people be discriminate against base on their postcode rather than recognise for their ability thankfully young people successfully fight back on that will also touch on the role of carer like so many frontline worker they show up and put their health and wellbee on the line to serve some of the most vulnerable in our community they do so despite at time limited and faulty ppe entrenched low pay and poor policy decision that see frail patient discharge from hospital and into care home untested contribute to care home death there can often be focus on downing street party or delete whatsapp message but at the forefront of our mind must always be the victim of covid include those who die unnecessarily and those who live with long covid and the psychological impact of the disease as my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur say there be also those who deliver the ultimate act of service include refuse collector police officer nurse shop worker and many other from the voluntary sector and religious establishment as we recognise the fifth anniversary of covid their effort in the face of such hardship their resilience and their sacrifice must be the true and lasting legacy of such an unprecedented pandemic which we must all fight to ensure that we never experience again will follow on from my hon friend the members for edinburgh south west dr arthur and for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter have be meet group of clinician who approach lead by dr rae duncan consultant cardiologist and long covid physician and researcher at newcastle hospital she have provide with detailed briefing note the two minute limit will not allow to do any justice to it so will circulate it to hon member but its message be very straightforward the team want to get across the message that covid be not over it be not seasonal and it be not just cold it be long term substantial and chronic burden will be brief this be diabetes week and we be rightly look at the impact that diabete have on child do the right hon member agree that similar approach must be take for long covid we must look at the unique impact it have on child and young people so that we can well understand it will the right hon member give way order think the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell need to respond to the first intervention appreciate what be happen though and he may wish to take the second intervention shortly afterwards have never see an intervention on an intervention will follow on from that point the clinician be try to get across to that as other have say covid double the risk of heart attack we have see heart attack stroke pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis in addition the team be try to get across the message that long covid be not simply fatigue it be an umbrella term for range of chronic multi system pathology that have an effect there be one issue that affect child in particular the work of dr danielle beckman have show that covid breach the blood brain barrier as result it infect the neuron and cause persistent brain inflammation thereby impose cognitive impediment my right hon friend be speak about child do he agree that the covid pandemic really affect child who be go through school all of sudden they could not see their friend for many many week work in the nhs when we be live in the moment we do not think of these thing but when we reflect we think oh god what time we live through that strike when be with my niece who be run through the park and she see her friend she be year old they run and hug it be fantastic to see they have not see each other for so long that act of kindness friendship and come together of spirit really lift because even child of that age be feel something huge that they have never feel before that be an inspirational point for during covid and the same point hit when carry out my nhs role the intervention on an intervention be definitely worth it will briefly raise another issue one of the message the clinician want to get across be exactly that child have not be spar some of the research they have do for example indicate that covid double the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabete in child as well recent study in america indicate that up to of child at the moment be endanger and experience long covid symptom one of the other issue that come out of my discussion with the clinician be that repeat infection be cumulative and dangerous result in long covid that increase the risk of cardiovascular neurological gastrointestinal and endocrine disease these clinician be try to get across how challenging the situation be the problem we have at the moment be that the office for national statistics covid infection survey have be shut down can understand the argument for do so at the time but the figure come out of the recent gps survey be that million people be experience long covid at the moment again staggering figure number of recommendation have be make one of which be to restore national infection surveillance as quickly as possible exactly as my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west have say we should fund research and clinical service for long covid we should implement public health mitigation to reduce infection particularly in place such as hospital classroom and so on we benefit from air circulation in this building other should as well finally as my hon friend say we should protect vulnerable population include child from the chronic disability that covid can impose will circulate the briefing paper to all member and we can have another discussion at another time be hop no one would turn up today and would have long for my speech call the liberal democrat spokesperson today we mark five year since the start of the pandemic just under people in the uk die with list as cause on their death certificate every one of those statistic be mother father brother sister child neighbour or friend thousand be separate from their love one and that loss and grief may never fully heal yet in the darkest of time the british people shine with immense compassion and courage and sense of community spirit doctor nurse and carer work punish hour often risk their own life teacher council worker and other work in the tough of condition and volunteer come forward in drove to collect and deliver prescription shop for the frail and elderly staff temporary centre to administer vaccine and check in on neighbour that resilience and solidarity show the very good of who we be sadly that same spirit of public service be not reflect in the high office of government the finding of the first covid inquiry lead by baroness hallett lay bare the truth that the uk be ill prepared for deal with catastrophic emergency let alone the coronavirus pandemic we have plan for the wrong pandemic one base on flu we ignore the risk associate with other potential pathogen we ignore warning and then we fail to act on lesson from past civil emergency exercise and outbreak of disease these be systemic and political failing that worsen people suffering let we be frank the most vulnerable pay the high price there be cruelty in the rigidity of restriction with family keep apart even in their love one final moment all of this be make more painful by the bitter hypocrisy of partygate betrayal of trust that mock the sacrifice of million the lib dems call for an inquiry in and we continue to demand answer the full fact must be know about every aspect of the government poor response this be not bear out of desire for vengeance the british people deserve to know the truth and they deserve far well in future we now have moral responsibility to act and this government must commit to implement the inquiry recommendation in full and without delay patient and care home resident must have legal right to maintain contact with their love one comprehensive civil emergency strategy be essential and the new uk resilience academy must train people in resilience and emergency role as promise can the minister give we confidence that this will be deliver the voice of frail and old people must be hear at the heart of government planning we call for commissioner for ageing and old people to ensure that their need be never neglect again public official must be hold to duty of candour the government promise of hillsborough law remain unfulfilled can the minister say when survivor and family will see the legislation for which they have wait so long we must also confront hard truth our nation be less resilient because health inequality have leave our population quite simply less healthy year of cut to public health service under the conservatives leave we more vulnerable the lib dems be call for urgent action to increase the public health grant and allow community to co produce plan establish health creation unit to lead cross government effort to improve health and wellbeing and tackle inequality improve access to blood pressure check in community space and expand social prescribing introduce new kitemark for health app and digital health tool ensure that they be clinically sound create new levy on tobacco company profit to fund healthcare and smoking cessation service and pass clean air act to tackle pollution and improve air quality lastly we must not forget those live with the consequence of the virus as member have mention we call for long covid register as we remember those whom we lose we owe it to they and to future generation to ensure that these lesson be not bury in report and leave on shelf but lead to real change that make improvement in our constituent live the british people be courageous generous and selfless they deserve government who act to match that spirit call the shadow secretary of state for health and social care congratulate the hon member for west ham and beckton james asser on his speech and on secure this important debate the vast majority of contribution today have be measure thoughtful and non political and think they have do this house proud it be right that we remember reflect and learn it be the least we owe those who lose love one during the pandemic as someone who during the pandemic be do the job of the minister recall it incredibly well as will so many in this house and outside it the hon gentleman say know what he mean that with the passage of five year sometimes what happen then can feel bit like dream it be something that still catch in mine at night often wake with jolt suddenly remember vividly something that take place then something that we do or have to do or particular moment as minister suspect that that be true of many up and down this country in many different walk of life particularly those who be on the frontline my wife be an obs and gynae doctor and she still be she be one of those people on the frontline whom the shadow secretary of state describe do he agree that there need to be study into the long term impact on the wellbeing of staff who be on the frontline deal with these traumatic situation so as to understand the impact on health and productivity within the nhs that be important because people up and down this country still live with the impact of the pandemic through long covid and mental health challenge we see that huge impact still today on individual and the nhs we must remember how the country come together in the face of unprecedented event about which we learn more every day we have to adapt our approach to that change knowledge be grateful to all member from all part of this chamber for what they do few member in the chamber be in the house at the time and they will remember the work of jon ashworth which recognise in particular he be in this place at that time and remember his cross party approach to so much that be do pay tribute to the emergency service to councillor and to the people of this country particularly those who work in health and social care and those who lose someone it be traumatic time for the whole country there be lesson that must be learn about plan for future pandemic and support those with long covid the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord be right like so many have constituent who lose love one and family member who be affect by the vaccine as have be recognise by coroner they have be dignified and courteous but they call for the government to review the vaccine damage payment scheme hope that the minister will take that suggestion in the spirit in which it be intend we owe it to this country to make sure that we be well prepared for any future pandemic we owe it to those who lose love one and those who suffer in so many different way those with long covid those with mental ill health kid who be unable to attend school domestic abuse sufferer and those who still suffer today it be right that we remember reflect and debate as we do now in order to learn as former health minister have memory that continue to surface we will all of we live with our memory of that time till the end of our day the least we can do be to ensure that this house and this country always remember and reflect carefully on what we can do well next time be short of time but the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my hon friend the member for barnsley south stephanie peacock who lead on this issue have hotfoot it

beckton for secure this important debate as we mark the fifth anniversary of the pandemic together we will ensure that lesson be learn that our loss be honour and that as nation we do not forget in the few second have just want to say that think it be important to have this debate so that the fifth anniversary do not pass without be mark it be clear that we have merely touch the surface of what could be say but thank hon member across the house who have contribute much have be say and there be clearly much more to say put on record my thank to my constituent for all they have do hope that all the family and all those affect who have be watch will feel that this debate have be important in recognise the past five year acknowledge that there be more to be say and that we will talk far about it question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the fifth anniversary of the pandemic thank all member and especially thank the minister for be so swift at the dispatch box duchenne muscular dystrophy motion make and question propose that this house do now dearden thank the minister for what think be her triple shift at the dispatch box today few month ago meet three really great young lad benjamin eli and jack we have great conversation and they have laugh and joke along with they for very long time slightly disappoint eli when first open my mouth because listen to he recognise where be from and he ask if could introduce he to sam fender the north east be quite small but do not know everyone and could see the disappointment on his face one of the thing we talk about be what they want to do in the future eli be consider be musician and jack say he would like to do something involve public speaking or who know even be politician it be really great to see that level of ambition but for it be ting with sadness know that they be unlikely to realise their ambition because benjamin jack and eli be unlikely to see their birthday benjamin jack and eli all have duchenne muscular dystrophy it be disease that affect only boy and about baby boy be bear with it every year diagnosis be normally at the age of three or four and at that moment the parent find out that their son have life limit condition that can not be treat and that he will probably need wheelchair by the age of and ventilator by the age of there be no cure for duchenne muscular dystrophy but there be hope now with new drug call givinostat givinostat be develop by an italian company italfarmaco and it be an example of the brilliance of our uk life science sector that it decide to develop the drug here in the uk as it have be trialle here italfarmaco have give the national health service unique option to prescribe givinostat through an early access programme entirely free of charge the nhs can offer this drug to boy in the uk completely free of charge and the early access programme have be available since november last year member might think that such an opportunity would be seize quickly by the nhs but sadly it have not be many family have have their hope raise only for they to be dash when they find that they can not access the treatment patient family and charity be now call for urgent access to givinostat as be many member of this house my constituent tracy be one of the many who have be fight for their child right to live and for the treatment that have be prove to slow down the progression of duchenne her son tom be year old and she tell that he be deteriorate givinostat have market authorisation for all boy with duchenne over the age of six it have be prove to slow its progression in clinical trial it be not cure the family realise it be not cure but it could help boy and young man to keep walk and use their muscle for long like my hon friend have constituent jamie tierney who sadly suffer with duchenne muscular dystrophy recently he have be able to begin treatment as have other patient in scotland but it take lot of work and in some case intervention by lawyer to get that jamie family tell that time be muscle do my hon friend agree that the soon we make givinostat available across all part of the uk the well it will be for those people yes do agree with that very timely intervention in fact the slogan of duchenne uk be time be muscle and it be absolutely right that every day and every week make difference to these boy congratulate the hon gentleman on bring forward this debate he and speak about it the other day have some constituent who have have brave few year with duchenne muscular dystrophy the problem be that the opportunity of this drug have never be there for they but it need to be up until now in northern ireland duchenne treatment have include corticosteroid physical therapy and other supportive therapy while access to new treatment such as vamorolone or givinostat be be work on we in northern ireland have not have access to they either it seem to be almost postcode lottery do he agree that these drug could give those young boy life change opportunity that they would never have otherwise and that with great respect to the minister the government need to move and ensure that they all get these drug thank the hon member for that intervention be very pleased that he have intervene and think the comment about postcode lottery be exactly right note when look at the figure that currently the belfast health and social care trust be not offer the drug to lad in northern ireland because it be claim that it will cost for patient that be different from the rest of the country by an order of magnitude so would be grateful if the minister look very carefully at the situation in northern ireland thank the hon gentleman for secure this debate have be engage with the oxford nhs trust which be not yet provide givinostat to boy in oxfordshire its own business case suggest that it would cost less than per boy and in total for the boy clearly as country we should be able to afford such sum do he agree that hospital that want to be world lead should be provide it do he far agree that this be exactly the sort of thing we need government intervention on so that these boy can get treatment as soon as possible do agree recognise the figure from the oxford university hospital nhs foundation trust it be quote around per lad treat which understand be very similar to other area of the country see that as quite small amount of money for the life that could be save despite as we have hear givinostat be available for more than seven month there have be very inconsistent approach across the uk very small number of ambulant people live with dmd have so far receive the treatment and no non ambulant boy have be treat with it yet too thank my hon friend for secure this important debate meet family in my constituency whose son be suffer with duchenne he be at that key stage right now where he still have his mobility but he be start to lose it do my hon friend agree that as the campaign say time be muscle if we act now we can prevent further deterioration of his mobility yes my hon friend be absolutely right about that time be muscle as she say sadly because the drug be currently only available in the area where it be available to lad who be ambulant the waiting time have mean that some lad out there who would have qualify for the drug now no long do so that is frankly heartbreaking of course the use of one leg be not the only thing people be concern about we need to be able to use our arm to be able to dress ourselves feed ourselves and brush our tooth and givinostat could help with that it be very disheartening that while cop with all of this family parent and carer and so on be have to fight for access to the drug on trust by trust basis they have do that with the support of all the members in the chamber tonight be very grateful for the fact that they have turn up because know family be watch also want to mention some member who have approach who would have love to have be here but can not be due to other commitment in the house my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend mary glindon have campaign on this subject for many year and chair the all party parliamentary group constituent of my hon friend the member for basingstoke luke murphy who have the disease visit parliament on monday and be so pleased to see on the annunciator that we be have this debate my hon friend the members for bury north mr frith and for bury south christian wakeford work together to ensure that manchester university nhs foundation trust do now provide the drug to their constituent william from codicote constituent of my hon friend the member for stevenage kevin bonavia be live with duchenne the hon member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth have be support mr and mrs binns whose son jack have duchenne they do not yet have access to givinostat and be try to get it have also have representation from my hon friend the member for beckenham and penge liam conlon the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron and my hon friend the member for altrincham and sale west mr rand we can see that there be broad support across all party in the house with member work with their constituent to try to secure this drug which be free of charge free of charge to the nhs we have hear that provision be very patchy across england there be some central co ordination in scotland but no lad in northern ireland can access the treatment thank my hon friend for secure this debate it be important to acknowledge quality of life with this drug but we also have to acknowledge that many people with duchenne be live with care need include my constituent dylan phillips who live at the excellent care home in glenbervie do my hon friend agree that those live with duchenne in scotland should be protect as they would be in england under continue healthcare scheme rather than have to bear the cost of their social care and live on only week with universal credit and adult disability payment as they do not qualify for continue healthcare in scotland the important thing for we to consider here be that with only or lad and young man in the country live with the disease and only boy eligible for the treatment we could at least expect some consistency in approach across the whole of the united kingdom to build on that point recently meet the parent of young man in his who absolutely reinforce the need to get givinostat fund properly across the country be also strike by how the life of both parent they be teacher and their other child be deeply affect by have to support their son and brother do my hon friend support my plea to the minister to reassure my constituent that adult social care service will continue to support people like they so that their life can be enrich it be really important that we remember the parent family and carer the big support network around these boy it seem to be such small thing that we need to do from the point of view of the nhs there be some very good example leicester royal infirmary be lead the way as the first hospital to dose patient however as we have hear some large specialist child hospital in many area have be slow to commit and only few have actually start dose patient although some be still work to make givinostat available the barrier that we hear about be lack of capacity and resource constraint clinic say that they need small amount of additional consultant time for pharmacy support and extra blood test but really in the context of the number of blood test that be carry out in the nhs on daily basis this number be really quite small however some trust still insist on tell family that they can not deliver the treatment because of that give that some trust can and some can not would like to hear from the minister what we might do to even out the service across the country some trust have express concern that after start patient on givinostat the national institute for health and care excellence might subsequently not approve it at its upcoming meeting in july and trust would have to withdraw the treatment well they would not need to do so italfarmaco the previously mention pharmacy company have make it clear that in the event of negative decision from nice it will continue to provide givinostat for those already enrol on the early access programme for as long as it be deem clinically beneficial to the patient continuity of supply letter have be sign between hospital take part in the early access programme and the company to ensure that this be in line with nhs england guidance there be two reason now to accelerate the roll out before nice decision in july the first be that every day and every week make difference to these young lad the second be that every lad who get on that programme before july will be guarantee this treatment for the rest of their life if it be not approve by nice when meet benjamin jack and eli have already disappoint eli by not be able to introduce he to sam fender so think would try to redeem myself say to they look ve come to see you but clearly when you come to parliament you do want to meet the member for stockton north who would you most like to meet they all say they would like to meet the secretary of state for health not primarily because he could help they with their disease but apparently they like he he be very popular member of parliament say see if can sort that out and do manage to sort it out the secretary of state very generously give lot of his time think his private office think he have vanish off the face of the earth because he have great time chat to benjamin jack and eli know that his intervention really cheer they up but it also give they hope for their future want sincerely to thank the secretary of state for health for his generosity in share his time on that day and for the difference that he make to those boy turn to my request of the minister in the short term what these family need be for hospital with specialist neuromuscular service across the whole of the united kingdom in england wales scotland and northern ireland to implement the early access programme swiftly and for it to be roll out to non ambulant patient too the free availability of the drug from the manufacturer mean that cost alone be not the barrier here the barrier be bureaucracy my simple ask to the minister be to act with the urgency need to roll out the medicine across the country as quickly as possible every day and every week matter the lad with duchenne do not have time to wait it be real pleasure to respond to this move debate know that many people with duchenne muscular dystrophy and their family will have want to tune in to hear what be say this afternoon thank member who have contribute in different way to the debate in particular thank my hon friend the member for stockton north chris mcdonald who secure this debate and advocate so powerfully for these family he really bring to life the experience of benjamin jack and eli and commend he for do so first acknowledge the profound impact that this debilitate disease have on those live with it and their family and the urgent need for new and effective treatment as have be say my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care hear at first hand from people affect by this condition early this year when he attend an event host by duchenne uk he meet many young patient and listen to what they say about the challenge that they face as we all know meet family and individual from our constituency leave long last effect on we and it be important that we continue to meet they timely and equitable access to innovative medicine for the treatment of dmd and other rare disease mention today be of the utmost importance the national institute for health and care excellence be the independent body responsible for assess whether new licensed medicine can be recommend for routine use in the nhs base on thorough assessment of their clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness through this process many thousand of patient include those with rare disease have be able to benefit from effective new treatment at price that represent value to the nhs nice have be able to recommend two medicine for the treatment of dmd ataluren recommend in and vamorolone which be recommend in january this year and be now available on the nhs to around eligible patient in line with nice recommendation as my hon friend have say nice be appraise givinostat and the first nice committee meeting be schedule for july this year if the medicine be recommend the nhs in england will be legally require to fund it be aware that small number of patient in the uk have be receive treatment with this drug through company lead early access programme establish by the pharmaceutical company italfarmaco as we have hear it be important to note that participation in these programme be decide at nhs trust level and although the drug be free to patient take part in it and to the nhs nhs trust must still cover administration cost and provide clinical resource to deliver the eap nhs england have publish guidance on free of charge medicine scheme such as the givinostat eap provide advice on financial administrative and clinical risk nhs england can not however centrally direct nhs trust to participate in company sponsor eap like this one or in any other private activity to issue any form of national direction around participation in eap would both pre empt and undermine the role of nice whose purpose be to advise the nhs on whether particular treatment should be make routinely available on the nhs even when there be an agreement that company will continue to provide drug free of charge in the event of negative decision by nice participate trust remain liable to cover the significant cost of deliver that service include the cost of the clinical resource and staff time need that would be outside their funding allocation and in addition to pay for any subsequent nice recommend treatment that they would be mandate to fund thank the minister for her response to which be listen very carefully appreciate her point that it would be inappropriate for the department of health and social care to direct what trust should do but what we have hear from the trust be that they would like to issue this drug but have certain issue and problem perhaps it might simply be matter of the department give help and support and facilitate information sharing between trust that have make this work and those that have not perhaps it could be more encouragement than direction thank my hon friend for that constructive suggestion we need to wait to see how the nice recommendation go in july with this disease and so many other it be important to share learning and information and trust should be encourage and support in do so we will work with he on that constructive recommendation understand my hon friend concern about the fact that non ambulant patient be not yet able to access givinostat but it be important to note that the eligibility criterion for participation in the early access programme have be determine by the pharmaceutical company nhs trust that decide to participate in the eap must only provide treatment in line with the criterion which state that patient must be ambulant clinical trial be be carry out by the pharmaceutical company to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug in non ambulant patient and to far explore the efficacy of the drug in this population know that for the patient and family affect it will be disappointing to hear that there be no access to the drug for ambulant patient before nice decision or for non ambulant patient prior to clinical trial be conclude want to assure my hon friend that we have arrangement in place to support rapid access to new medicine will the minister give way will not want to finish in the time available and think member want to hear the full response outside of company lead eap there be establish route for patient to get access to new innovative medicine prior to they be license the early access to medicine scheme or eams help give people in the uk with life threaten or seriously debilitate condition early access to new medicine that be not yet license where there be clear unmet medical need eams be support by key partner include the mhra nice and nhs england and be key part of this government commitment to accelerate patient access to innovative life change treatment in support of the uk position as global leader in life science in fact since the scheme launch in over medicine include for this disease have benefit from be access early through eams the innovative medicine fund have also make available million of ringfenced funding for the nhs to fund early access to medicine that nice have recommend with manage access through this process license treatment that demonstrate substantial clinical promise but still have significant uncertainty around their clinical and cost effectiveness can be fund further evidence be then collect on the drug for define period of time that be consider by nice in determine whether the drug can be recommend for routine nhs funding the secretary of state have be clear that if givinostat be recommend by nice in draft guidance nhs england should aim to work with the pharmaceutical company to provide early funding through the innovative medicine fund this could potentially speed up access by up to five month and the treatment could be fund as soon as this summer if recommend this scope of this debate be wide than just access to new medicine it be important to note that while rare disease be individually rare they be collectively common one in people will be affect by rare condition over their lifetime the uk rare disease framework outline four priority base on engagement with the rare disease community they be help patient to get final diagnosis fast increase awareness of rare disease among healthcare professional well co ordination of care and improve access to specialist care treatment and drug in england we publish rare disease action plan annually these detail the specific step we be take to meet the share priority of the framework be pleased to highlight the england action plan which be publish in february this year on rare disease day one such action be review the effectiveness of early access scheme such as the early access to medicine scheme the innovative licensing and access pathway and the innovative medicine fund they be all design to help make innovative treatment available early to patient who need they we be specifically consider how well they support access to treatment for people live with rare disease like duchenne nhs england nice and mhra will meet annually to continue to discuss progress on these scheme these meeting will include representative from patient advocacy group and from industry and clinical researcher and the next one will happen in the summer manage complex rare condition can be challenging and it often mean interact with many different specialist and provider of health and social care it can mean travel across the country to access highly specialist care from expert all of that can add up to significant emotional and physical burden and it can deepen inequality co ordination of care can minimise this burden on patient and their carer and it can ensure that healthcare professional work together to provide the good possible care as we have discuss this evening in the action plan we have introduce new action to incentivise provider to run clinic for multi system disorder in order to reduce the number of appointment and improve co ordination of care for family the nhs be also work to include the definition of co ordination of care that be set out in the concord co ordinate care of rare disease study in all new and revised nhs service specification for patient with rare disease recognise how hard it be when patient want access to these new treatment also recognise the distress and worry it cause not only to patient but their family and friend hon member have articulate that well on behalf of their constituent this evening the government be commit to provide access to the most innovative medicine but it have to be at price that provide value for the nhs and it have to be clinically safe and effective that be why we be work hard with industry nice and mhra to make that happen know that my hon friend the member for stockton north will continue to work with the government and provider to make that happen be grateful for the opportunity to respond to this debate on such an important issue question put and agree to house adjourn
