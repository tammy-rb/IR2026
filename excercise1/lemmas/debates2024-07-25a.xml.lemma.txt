welcome my hon friend to her place she and be involve in young labour together only few year ago feel so it be great to see she finally in this place where she belong she raise the important matter of nhs dentistry and the difficulty that people have get an nhs appointment which be particularly acute in norfolk that be why the government be commit to rescue plan and to provide another nhs dentist appointment which hope will relieve that acuteness in norfolk thank you madam deputy speaker congratulate you on your election and welcome you to the chair although it feel bit weird to welcome anyone here give that have be here for about two minute follow on from the excellent contribution make by my hon friend the member for poole neil duncan jordan for cardiff west mr barros curtis and for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray among other praise in particular my hon friend for edinburgh east and musselburgh both because he give an excellent speech and because his mum be one of my constituent as start this new job have be think lot about my family be do so while prepare my remark today be think in particular of my grandpa who be coalminer in the coalfield of lanarkshire just outside glasgow when be wee boy he would tell of the condition that he work in darkness he say so black that you could hold your hand right in front of your eye and still not be able to see it in that darkness he would toil away unable to imagine his own future let alone that of his grandwean as he would say all the while he toil he be inhale fume so toxic that later in life he would have lung cancer and live the rest of his life with just one lung my dad welder be here today off during the glasgow fair along with my mum who run her own business to watch from the gallery my career so far have be very different from that of my parent and grandparent for start they have proper job whereas be now do this for living but it have be different for two relate reason the first be the labour party both in the sense that it have help to provide with new job and in the protection that it have deliver for work people health and safety legislation deliver by labour and build by the trade union movement have end the kind of condition that my grandparent work in the second reason my career have be different be technology suspect that today in britain there be more bitcoin miner than coalminer and that be ultimately good thing coalmining be difficult hard laborious work as kid spend many long hour in front of my computer and while much of that be spend play fifa against my wee brother mark some of it be more productive because teach myself to code watch youtube video and over week month and year learn how to build software develop iphone app that be use around the world mean that code write on my laptop in glasgow could be push out to device around the world in second and that this year old kid in his childhood bedroom could run an app servicing people from los angeles to dubai if it can do that technology can reform our public service too technology might even help to reform this house as we be debate today hope and know that high growth innovative business in my home city of glasgow will be key part of that much have be say and write about glasgow over the year but one thing stick with in particular anthony bourdain be not man know for his parliamentary language so let we just say that he describe glasgow as the most unpretentious place on earth an antidote to the world in his word so unapologetically work class and attitude free think he be right because of all the thing love about glasgow it be our people and our humour that enjoy most if someone ever get wee bit too big for their boot return home to glasgow will soon put an end to that something be sure will be increasingly useful the long spend in this place unlike many glaswegians my admiration even extend to some of glasgow politician it be customary in speech such as this to praise our predecessor but know that for some that will be do through slightly gritted tooth at the end of long and bitter fought election campaign in my case talk about my predecessor with genuine warmth and admiration stewart mcdonald serve the people of glasgow south diligently and build an enviable reputation in this place he be particularly respect for his long stand support for the people of ukraine something that see he award the ukrainian order of merit if leave this place have do half as much as he do for people around the world fight for democracy will leave happy man before stewart there be labour predecessor there be tom harris who have be personally kind to john maxton now lord maxton whose son teach modern study in high school believe it or not although will leave it up to other to decide whether he do good or bad job of that and of course teddy taylor who be still remember fondly by many of my constituent would also like to mention two other member of this house who have big impact on my life both from glasgow the former member for east kilbride adam ingram grow up in the east end of glasgow and be one of the first people ever speak to in the labour party his advice and wise counsel have be constant source of support to over the year and be incredibly grateful the other be southsider my friend and the former member for glasgow central anas sarwar have the great privilege of serve as the director of anas successful leadership campaign to become leader of scottish labour three and half year ago as we sit begin that campaign it be hard to imagine what the future might hold but even in our most optimistic of moment do not think we would have predict this stand here as one of scottish labour mps have praise three glaswegians will do something unusual for glasgow mp and praise someone from edinburgh my right hon friend the member for edinburgh south ian murray have be friend of mine for many year and he deserve enormous credit for his long and lonely shift as the sole scottish labour mp and for be someone who recognise that the labour party have to change if it be to earn people trust once again it give enormous pleasure and pride to see he in his rightful place as the secretary of state for scotland that brief interlude aside we return to scotland real capital city be privileged to represent glasgow southside place that have have something of renaissance in recent year boast the trendy tenement of shawlands the tree line avenue of newlands and the beautiful conservation village of carmunnock among other my constituency contain many of glasgow beautiful park of which linn park queen park and pollok country park be just few in the latter hon member will find the burrell collection which be award the art fund museum of the year award after its reopening last year like many part of the city however we be not without difficulty castlemilk be an area with enormous spirit and the kind people anyone will ever meet but it also remain an area with challenge even today the simple act of get supermarket in castlemilk have prove difficult something hope hope to change as local mp what be true of all my constituency be that it be an outward look diverse and welcome place the scots asian community in particular have contribute enormously to glasgow character and be very proud to represent they here in parliament immigration have make my constituency rich and it make our country rich too the southside of glasgow be also passionately pro european place although brexit be settle in the previous parliament intend to support the government move to repair our relationship with europe my first duty be to my constituency and my country be the member of parliament for glasgow south be the only job that will do so long as the people of glasgow south wish for to continue but also feel sense of responsibility towards the many million of people at home and around the world who do not have voice the people toil away in darkness just as my grandpa do all those year ago hope that none of we in this house forget the million indeed billion of people around the world who be not as lucky as we include those face persecution or war those without access to clean water or good education and those bind by modern slavery be one of the lucky few to serve in this place but will never forget the people who put here and the people who do not have voice deliver for they will be how judge my success
