what pleasure it be to respond to the contribution of my hon and gallant friend the member for bracknell james sunderland this evening hope that we will be able to reflect on huge success in our country it be wonderful thing for our community to have cadet have see they in my constituency and they be an important part of the local fabric support occasion from remembrance sunday to armed forces day and beyond we be lucky to have they pay particular tribute to the volunteer who make that possible so many of our institution have be afraid suffer as result of the pandemic and it have be extremely difficult for they to get go again yet cadet seem to have bounce back and be flourish and the reason be that there be people who be prepared to give up their time and shoulder fair amount of inconvenience to serve their community in that way we all owe they great deal the benefit that our cadet programme offer to young people and society as whole be well known and well rehearse agree wholeheartedly that the mod sponsor cadet force provide brilliant opportunity for our young people they have be catalogue by academic from the university of northampton to whom be grateful for their rigorous appraisal which give scientific objectivity to what we all understand instinctively to be the case namely that cadet be force for good participation in cadet have be show to build character self discipline and self reliance it improve teamworking problem solving leadership and social skill it provide boost for physical and mental health benefit that be sure my hon friend will know about from his time as cadet which he describe so well have to say that my time be not quite as happy as his remember join the air cadet briefly be tell be go to fly aircraft after about two month it dawn on that that be not go to happen it would be march up and down for as long as could put up with it which be not very long have to say that part company from the cadet much soon than my hon friend but there it be be sure it benefit on some level headteacher of school that have establish cadet unit report that their cadet have improve attendance and academic attainment as well as behaviour and self confidence some headteacher use cadet as central part of their strategy to reduce exclusion cadet programme be also gateway to new skill new qualification and even employment they be also valuable way of make young people aware of the further opportunity available in defence and defence relate industry although as my hon friend make clear cadet force be not mean to be recruit tool as our military footprint have shrink however cadet have assume an even more important role in at least provide some sort of presence in many community where otherwise there would be none they benefit the whole of society by build link between different community boost social mobility and strengthen young people resilience to become involve in antisocial behaviour criminality and even extremism in short join the cadet be springboard to success as well as be powerful engine for social mobility and level up the cadet expansion programme be joint ministry of defence and department for education initiative to

number of cadet in school unit to by april however cadet unit require significant amount of personal commitment from school leader and volunteer and in spite of success about of the unit establish since have fail often as result of change to school leadership or priority that be pity but it in no way detract from the leadership and drive of school team that have advance the cadet programme to whom pay tribute as we approach april although cadet number in school have increase by since april to more than it be clear that covid have have an impact on this as on so much of our national life and that we will not reach our aspiration within the challenge timeframe that we set however it be not only the direct impact of the pandemic that have slow progress in addition to cadet activity be halt or limit by covid restriction participation have be affect by the result change in school priority with many understandably reorientate themselves from extra curricular activity to prioritise catch up on lose learning give this context the fact that we have already achieve of our ambition to have cadet in school be great credit to every individual and school involve in our expansion
