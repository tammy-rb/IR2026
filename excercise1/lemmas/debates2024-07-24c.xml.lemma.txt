resonate with everyone to be truthful but it resonate with because know young carer in my constituency perhaps they be not the good student but they have reason for it the story that he tell may be year old but it be still relevant today and thank he for it it be so important that we have debate on education have say in this place so many time that our young people truly be the future to ensure that they have the tool need to succeed we have to make difficult decision education be devolve in northern ireland so ministers here do not have respond on it they do not have to take any notice and they do not need to say to themselves must reply to the hon member they might wish to say something but they do not have any responsibility for our education however want to give northern ireland perspective as always do and make two point there be so many opportunity out there for young people some may know what route they want to take in life and for those who do not there be other option education may not be everybody option as the hon member for harlow say but there be other thing that we need to do through education as well minister will no doubt take that on board whether in employment further education or apprenticeship there be opportunity for people to avail themselves of furthermore be big supporter of work experience and the prospect that it can bring for young people especially in their education and future employment it can give young people taste for work and the possibility that it can lead they to try to offer it every year in my office as do when be member of the legislative assembly and when have my own business two of my young staff member one aged and one aged both do their work experience in my office one back in and the other in we never realise that they would one day end up work for they go and do another job in between but end up come back to whether they think be soft touch or what it be be not quite sure be sure that they do not

experience they be able to come into the job like they have always be there that stick in my mind whether it be in aerospace healthcare science technology engineering and math government law medium

be reduce with funding cut indeed it have be indicate that the teaching grant for northern ireland university will be reduce by to save around million it be also plan that funding for further education college would be cut by to save an additional million in the limited time that have leave want briefly to discuss the opportunity that apprenticeship provide for young people mention early that not every person can have civil service job or be in university or another form of education but they can have opportunity out there in society our university be incredible but there be young people out there who do not see university as path for they to go down the number of people age to pursue an apprenticeship have be increase consistently since showcase how the world of work can provide opportunity for young people who perhaps do not want to go to university apprenticeship be provide in so many industry there be always something that can be find to give young people the good start on their employment path the issue always lie with funding and that be why it be so important that these issue be represent northern ireland have suffer for too long from ill thought out budget and lack of funding it be time for our word to be listen to and for budget to be reconsider for the betterment of young people and their future believe as everybody participate in this debate do that our young people be the future and want they to get many more opportunity than get we be responsible for ensure that education and employment opportunity be available to all young people across this

labour party boast three alumnus of my old school sacred heart catholic high school in newcastle my hon friend the members for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend mary glindon and for cramlington

now as many state educate sacred heart girl in the house of commons as there be old etonian boy tangible demonstration of the radical redistribution of opportunity that this labour government represent my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter give an account of her school trip to parliament which remind of my own trip at the age of when get in trouble for sit down on these benches clearly such trip work to break down barrier to opportunity the journey start in child early year when their development and education begin under successive conservative government however the attainment gap have widen it be now some year since serve on the treasury committee but still recall our inquiry into childcare as part of national infrastructure it be ground breaking at the time and acknowledge that childcare be fundamental service to our economy it be not nice to have it be fundamental to allow parent to work long hour to provide for their family and it be fundamental to people life chance that be why this government will deliver more primary school base nursery make they widely accessible to parent and unlock opportunity for our young in answer to the shadow secretary of state question early that will be deliver in partnership with the sector to ensure that it meet the need of child and parent we know that childcare need do not end when school start when child move up to primary school in england they will benefit from the roll out of free breakfast club in every primary school in england this will drive up attainment improve behaviour and attendance and enable parent to start work on time and support their family it will set child up for the day and set they up to achieve because it be as much about the club as it be about the breakfast be in the classroom at the start of the day matter school have unique power to open up enormous opportunity for their pupil with teacher and support staff who make mark on every child life that include support child with special educational need and disability to flourish but across that system we have to acknowledge the many challenge that we face our building be substandard our child be too often unhappy in school and our support staff feel underappreciated we have to do well so many member today have touch on the crisis in support for those with special educational need and disability include my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes who know have work tirelessly on this issue for many year and my hon friend the member for dartford jim dickson who also speak passionately today this government will help school to take community wide approach to send improve their capability to accommodate pupil in mainstream setting and support they to flourish last week visit the brilliant croftway academy in northumberland it demonstrate how child of different ability and need can have the high standard of education in mainstream setting but we also need to ensure that special school can cater for those with the most complex need for those struggle with the pressure of school life this labour government will fund mental health support in every secondary school and in every community so that they can access support before problem escalate know that mental health be priority for many in this place as be powerfully describe by my hon friend the member for aylesbury laura kyrke smith in her speech as shadow schools minister hear many story of decision be take about our school that just do not factor in the need of community there be delay that turn to disappointment and frustration have see this in my own constituency with lack of proper planning cause chaos to school admission in gosforth this year and countless story of failure be replicate across the country so under labour school will need to co operate with their local authority on school admission on send inclusion and on place planning no more of the chaos that we have see over the last few year we want child to leave school with the skill and knowledge to set they up for life that mean broad and balanced curriculum that encourage they to try new thing ask question express themselves and be creative while also gain an excellent foundation in reading writing and math so we be establish an expert lead review on the curriculum and will collaborate with the sector to allow school teacher parent and student to contribute and to plan ahead on the question of remove exemption for private school which have be raise this change will enable vital investment in more teacher and improve nursery provision commend the contribution from my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince former math teacher while we be delighted that he be in his place we need to ensure that we have more math teacher in our state school my hon friend the member for monmouthshire catherine fookes speak about be school governor and we need more of those too my hon friend the member for montgomeryshire and glyndŵr steve witherden give powerful testimony to his dear late mother we share his grief and we share her pride ultimately education be about prepare child and young people for life and give they the skill they need to get on but these opportunity do not end at the school gate for too long education have be poorly match to the ambition of young people and the need of business and employer allow talent to go untapped and the economy to flag that be why early this week we announce skills england transformative new body to match education to the need of the economy by deploy skill investment strategically we will bring employment opportunity to the part of the country where young people need break and business need their skilled labour my hon friend the member for derby south baggy shanker speak powerfully about his apprenticeship and his passion for ensure those opportunity for other my hon friend the member for milton keynes central emily darlington speak about the need to not have to leave the place you love to get on in life my hon friend the member for gravesham dr sullivan want to see curriculum for life my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak have rightly be recognise as mention early all of this work will require partnership approach none of the challenge we face can be address by one person or one body alone that be why we be reset the relationship between government and the sector we be listen to professional we be learn from good practice we be work to improve standard across the board it be also why want to take this opportunity today to pay tribute to all those who work in our school to thank they and to wish they restful and restorative summer break under this labour government neither person place of birth nor the income of their parent will determine what they can achieve how they find fulfilment how they discover their skill and talent or how they grow in confidence because break down the barrier to opportunity be labour guide focus it be the job of this government and it be one that we be commit to deliver question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider education and opportunity
