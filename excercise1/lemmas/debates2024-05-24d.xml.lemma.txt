transform its use of sanction we have deploy sanction in innovative and impactful way include in our response to russia invasion of ukraine we have take rigorous approach carefully target to deter and disrupt malign behaviour and to demonstrate our defence of international norm this statutory instrument cover several measure that will strengthen our sanction regime across the board and allow we to continue the work already be implement across government will run through each measure in turn first in october the government add new type of sanction the director disqualification sanction to the sanctions and anti money laundering act this instrument use that power to amend the uk autonomous sanction regime which will mean that the government can apply it to individual designate under these regime it will be an offence for designate person subject to this new measure to act as director of company or to take part in the management formation or promotion of company this will far prevent those sanction from deriving benefit from the uk economy it be an important addition to the uk sanction toolkit this instrument provide ministers with the flexibility to apply the new measure on case by case basis the government will ensure that the measure be target and operate alongside the uk full suite of sanction power this instrument also enable the government to issue licence to person to allow they to undertake activity that be otherwise prohibit the foreign commonwealth and development office have be work closely with the department for business and trade companies house and the insolvency service on the implementation of this measure the si will also clarify the sanction enforcement remit of his majesty revenue and customs hmrc have well establish responsibility for enforce trade sanction in its capacity as the uk custom authority in recent year however the scope of trade sanction have evolve beyond import and export prohibition to include matter that be outside hmrc custom remit such as sanction on stand alone service last december the government announce the decision to establish the office of trade sanctions implementation within the department for business and trade in order to enforce these new type of measure under the civil law once it start operate otsi will also be able to refer serious offence to hmrc for criminal enforcement consideration hmrc will continue to have both civil and criminal enforcement responsibility for sanction within its custom remit this legislation be need to clarify the sanction measure for which hmrc be solely responsible for enforce and those which it will investigate on referral from otsi or another civil enforcement organisation the sanctioning of the shadow fleet be an issue of great importance to the foreign affairs committee so thank the government for introduce this really important legislation may also thank you mr speaker for your support of the foreign affairs committee during this parliament and put on the record my thank to an incredible committee that it have be an incredible honour to chair thank in particular my clerk chris shaw who be truly incredible as well as the rest of the committee who have be wonderful on behalf of the committee also thank the government for all they have do on ukraine show the leadership that mean that ukraine be still stand and fighting will my right hon friend the minister confirm that this be not just about tackle money and profit go into the russian coffer but about violation of maritime law and that be why today sanction be so very important and why the government be show yet again that we will always stand by ukraine thank my hon friend for her intervention and indeed for her very kind word towards those who do huge amount of work behind the scene to enable we to bring forward rolling level of sanction legislation which have continue to degrade putin ability to fund his war we believe that sanction across the piece have take some billion out of his capability it be continuum and today legislation continue that she be absolutely right the sanction will continue to be tool that help we in many way to keep ahead of those who wish we harm and who wish to support putin in his illegal war in ukraine and to continue to hunt they down and to restrict their capacity the minister and have work on various thing over the year those of we in all party who be passionate about sanction be still extremely worried about certain significant people in this country recent article in the times suggest that hereditary peer in the house of lords be main channel of russian money help certain political faction not only in this country but in the united states be it not about time that we do something about the upper house which seem to have small group of pro putin member the hon gentleman have as he say be an incredible champion and supporter of all the work we have be do cross party to keep ahead of the sanction know it be frustrating but as always say people should pass evidence of any sort about individual they consider be supportive of or enable putin his regime or any military activity to the team in the fcdo which look day in day out at be able to bring forward package of evidence that would withstand judicial review we stand ready will never comment on what we be take in and what might come next but the team be work flat out to look at the evidence wherever they can that be continuum say that not only to member of this house but more widely to those out on the frontline or work with business where they see area in which they believe that be happen they should bring the information to we will the minister accept some evidence have about the earl of oxford and asquith that think should be urgently consider by all of we careful and worried about sanction if the hon gentleman would like to write to later today will make sure that the team look at the information as soon as possible order know it be the final day for the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman but we still have rule in this house about be critical of member of another house could he still use that caution even on his last day in the house thank you mr speaker this legislation be need to clarify the sanction measure for which hmrc be solely responsible for enforce on those it would investigate on referral from otsi it will therefore establish consistent approach to the enforcement of trade sanction it will facilitate hmrc and otsi work in close partnership so that they can robustly enforce all trade sanction against russia and other target country use civil and criminal power on the financial sanction side the statutory instrument also include new obligation for person designate under the belarus regime to report any asset they own hold or control in the uk or worldwide as uk person to the relevant authority the measure be another step in improve the transparency of asset own hold or control in the uk by designate person and will strengthen the ability of hm treasury office of financial sanctions implementation ofsi to implement and enforce uk financial sanction importantly the measure will act as dual verification by enable the comparison of disclosure by designate person against exist reporting requirement that bite on firm such as financial institution under the new requirement the government will be able to penalise those who make deliberate attempt to conceal asset to escape the effect of sanction an equivalent reporting obligation be place on designate person under the russia regime in december the extension of this requirement to belarus ensure alignment between the russia and belarus regime which be particularly vital give the frequent overlap of the belarus and russia sanction regime and the co operation between the two state in relation to russia invasion of ukraine we have also include several sanction on belarus on the export of so call battlefield good which include good such as electronic equipment integrated circuit and firearm and aerospace technology these new measure prohibit the import of belarusian aluminium into the uk both the metal itself and aluminium product aluminium product be sector of strategic importance to belarus and have be its top export to the uk although the uk nexus with the belarusian economy be limited the signal impact of our sanction on belarus be and will remain important we keep these sanction under constant review and reserve the right to introduce further measure so that the lukashenko regime continue to feel the consequence of its lack of respect for human right and its support for putin war finally we be also revoke the burundi sanction regime that will remove an empty regime from the statute book the decision in not to transpose into uk law designation under the original eu sanction regime reflect the improved political situation in burundi we do not have the same level of concern about the widespread political violence in burundi that lead to the original decision to impose the regime so we have make no designation under it as we set out in the recent uk sanction strategy the government keep their regime under review and respond to change circumstance we be commit to lift regime out of specific measure or revoke designation when the original objective be no long serve by its continuance to conclude sanction continue to play an important part in the uk which continue to build on its already impressive sanction capability in the year since the landmark sanctions and anti money laundering act our approach to sanction have evolve considerably to respond to the change in the world we will continue to work on sanction to meet any new challenge commend the regulation to the house may echo your comment mr speaker about the deputy speakers who be sadly step down at the snap general election also thank the minister for set out the purpose of the regulation for her general cross party working and for her assurance that the security minister and the treasury be look at such sanction because they need cross government approach also echo her comment about the excellent work of official at the office of financial sanctions implementation labour support the necessary and common sense step be take in the statutory instrument we will not seek to divide the house on it although it might have be nice to have consider it last week rather than this morning from the point of view of one nerve as party we have consistently support the government in expand the uk sanction regime as it relate to variety of country but particularly russia since the unlawful and barbaric invasion of ukraine we have also be candid and honest where we think that minister be not go far enough or have act too slowly in hold global actor to account or where there be considerable loophole in our regime that they continue to exploit when it come to the integrity of our sanction regime we have make it clear that labour will work assiduously with partner and ally to counter the plethora of threat pose by actor across the world will ensure proper enforcement and will bring about the seizure of russian state asset for the purpose of support ukrainian reconstruction before turn to the measure will raise more general issue that my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty the shadow minister for europe have bring to our attention on several occasion on the enforcement of monetary penalty for breach of the uk sanction regime the ofsi website show that only one penalty have be issue against the russian regime since the start of the war in ukraine can the minister elucidate whether that be the case be the website out of date or be there another reason why our enforcement be woefully low in comparison with the usa for example hope that she can supply clarity on that labour support the measure they will prevent designated person be director of company or oversee the promotion formation or management of company which be necessary step in dismantle the ecosystem of illicit finance in which designate person skirt sanction and retain access to their wealth ask the minister for clarity on one point concern have be raise by hon member on both side of the house about the issuing of licence that grant designate person dispensation to become exempt from give provision can she clarify whether there will be ministerial oversight of the granting of those licence will the treasury the foreign commonwealth and development office and the department for business and trade work in lockstep to ensure cohesion and co ordination when it come to their granting last year revelation come to light regard licence issue to none other than yevgeny prigozhin that allow he to sue uk journalist that be what can happen when licence be issue without proper scrutiny hope that the minister can provide clarity on their granting we also support the measure relate to the mandate of his majesty revenue and customs on belarus as well as the new reporting obligation on person designate under the asset freeze to disclose the value and nature of any fund or economic resource that they own hold or control in the uk we also support the prohibition of export from the uk of item critical to russian weapon system and military development in addition to certain aerospace good the prohibition of belarusian aluminium import and the ban on the provision of ancillary service why have it take so long to bring in those prohibition measure it seem unconscionable that well over two year since the onset of the war in ukraine do not forget that the house belarusian concern be raise before then uk item that could be use in russian weaponry be make their way via belarus to the frontline potentially aid and abet russia war effort against the people of ukraine we understand that any sanction regime be work in progress but we can not continue to countenance uk export filter through to putin and the crony who facilitate his war machine especially give the situation in and around kharkiv at present thank the minister for set out the measure though as say they could have come early hope that she can provide clarity on the concern that raise labour will continue to support further expansion of our sanction regime but it be become ever clear that the action that we take today will have lasting ramification in devise such action in the next parliament we will strive to be even bold swifter and more ambitious we come to maiden speech call chris webb thank you mr

have very young child to look after congratulate the hon gentleman if you do not mind mr speaker would like to offer some brief thank yous will probably be speak on the tribunal measure later but now would be more appropriate time for this give the mood of the house thank few of my colleague who will no long be in this place after the election first thank my hon friend the member for glasgow north patrick grady who during my time as deputy leader be the chief whip of the snp he be my confidante and my rock we have many late night session plan parliamentary mischief not least in advance of the snp walk out that think number of people will remember very well appreciate everything he do for during that time thank my hon friend the member for glenrothes peter grant who be probably not someone who will be remember for set the heather on fire in this place but he have do absolutely everything that have need to be do and everything ask of he he have deal with some incredibly technical legislation and he have always be there with word of advice whenever they be need also thank my right hon friend the member for dundee east stewart hosie who have be in this place for long time he will be step back from frontline politic but be sure not from the snp he have similarly be huge source of advice and although we have have some very good natured disagreement have huge respect for everything he have do particularly for the snp as whole and have no doubt he will carry on do that on very personal note thank my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire south mhairi black who have be one of my close friend in this place and whose departure have not quite reconcile myself with and be not sure will ever get over will miss she incredibly intend to come back to this place and she do not will miss she huge amount on this specific debate and the sanction regime my hon friend the member for glasgow central alison thewliss be not here today but have do huge amount of work as be sure member across the house will recognise particularly on issue such as beneficial ownership and scottish limited partnership we have concern in relation to sanction and this legislation represent good step in close some of the loophole that friend and colleague have be raise in about scottish limited partnership be start only four of which be start by scot we have be campaigner on scottish limited partnership and have massive concern still about the slp regime and the fact it be use for money laundering in significant number despite their be call scottish limited partnership they be technically nothing to do with scotland which be why we need westminster to take action it would be great if whoever be in the next government could crack down on the abuse in slp we be pleased with some of the action take on beneficial ownership but we do not think we be there yet we need to ensure that the sanction regime and everything associate with they be apply appropriately if we do not know who actually own something it be very difficult to say that they can not own it progress be be make on the companies house issue that we have mention before but again my hon friend the member for glasgow central would make it clear that thing have not go far or fast enough in the reform of companies house again that be about transparency when the minister be speak she very much stress transparency in the sanction regime and be pleased with any move that improve transparency clearly we will not be oppose the si today think it be good thing but there be still more to be do to ensure that sanction regime work appropriately so that those people who should not be able to have directorship or ownership or to money launder or make money through the uk because we have designate they as responsible for or aid war crime or human right abuse can not do so there be more to do to increase that transparency so that those people can be crack down on lastly on sanction we be still concerned that the uk government have be too slow to increase the number of individual who have be sanction other jurisdiction have significantly high number of individual who have be sanction particularly from area such as russia appreciate the number of statement that the uk government have make and the number of action they have take particularly around ukraine and the hard work that have be do to support its people which know be appreciate by people in the ukrainian government however still think more could be do to ensure that this place be say to russia your action be inappropriate and we be go to hit you where it hurt financially by increase the number of individual who be sanction who be subject to those financial penalty and the inability to move money or have company in these island thank the minister for bring this si forward today and make clear that the snp be absolutely supportive of it follow the election we look forward to significantly more work be do to tighten those loophole and increase the number of individual who be subject to sanction question put and agree to resolve that the sanctions eu exit miscellaneous amendments and revocations regulations si no date may copy of which be lay before this house on may be approve coroner beg to move that the draft coroners suspension of requirement for jury at inquest coronavirus regulations which be lay before this house on may be approve before address the purpose of the statutory instrument would also like to congratulate the new hon member for blackpool south chris webb on his maiden speech his effort to avoid be the subject of pub quiz honourable though they be may be slightly forlorn can not recall too many occasion on which an hon member make their maiden speech on the same day that parliament rise for the next election so suspect that he may still be the subject of pub quiz into the future this instrument be an important part of the government ongoing support for coroner service in their continue recovery from the pandemic it extend for further two year the disapplication of the statutory requirement for any inquest into death involve to be hold with jury which will have practical benefit for the coroner service although the real time impact of have diminish they be inevitably delay in the coronial context as inquest backlog some of which be build up during the pandemic in order to manage wide pressure continue to be work through natural death would not normally be report to the coroner however where the cause of death be unknown or suspicious or have occur in state detention may be suspect as contribute factor save for the provision that we be seek to extend section of the coroners and justice act would require any inquest into such death to be hold with jury because be notifiable disease as the minister may be aware have two tragic case in my constituency involve an inquest do he not think it be about time that we modernise the whole system and give it more resource if somebody have lose love one wait for five or six year and never get resolution be not good be it not about time that we look at the process and the training and do something bit fast for people thank the hon gentleman for his question and will take this opportunity to say farewell to he his leaving will be loss to the house he make good point the propose measure will combat some of what he talk about but there be wide possibility for review as time move on we want coronial inquest to be carry out and expedite as quickly as possible as part of easement the coronavirus act remove the requirement for inquest into such death to be hold with jury and the result resource pressure on coroner service throughout the pandemic to support continued pandemic recovery in the coroner court parliament sanction the replacement of the emergency measure with provision in the judicial review and courts act to amend the act so that for the purpose of jury requirement and inquest relate to notifiable disease do not count as notifiable disease that do not prevent the coroner from call jury in relate inquest they retain the discretion to do so as with any other inquest the act provision include safeguard to ensure that inquest be not treat differently on permanent basis any extension be limit to two year be subject to parliamentary approval and must be justify by an assessment of the impact on coroner service be the provision to expire to evidence the need for extension of the provision the ministry of justice ask all coroner in england and wales to estimate their usage of the disapplication provision since june and to assess the impact on their case management if it be not extend the response rate be only around but even among that small number of coroner it be estimate that this provision have remove the requirement for jury in around inquest over the past two year without it even that small sample would have increase the annual number of jury inquest across england and wales typically around by about about half the respondent predict significant impact for their case management if this provision be allow to expire this be because as the liverpool and wirral senior coroner put it for each day of list for an inquest without jury it take week list with jury that wide context be important parliament be concerned about the impact of inqu backlog on the bereaved as the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman highlight the extension of this measure for further two year will support coroner in their continue effort to reduce those backlog thereby promote the government objective of put the bereaved at the heart of the coronial process that should mean that subject to any assessment close to the time do not expect any future justice minister to need to seek parliament agreement to further extension from june may too put on record my thank to you mr speaker and to the deputy speakers for look after our interest during this parliament congratulate my hon friend the member for blackpool south chris webb on his brilliant maiden speech we learn that his wife be call portia that be quite appropriate as we be discuss justice bill give that portia give one of the most famous speech on justice in the merchant of venice the quality of mercy be not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it be twice bless it blesseth he that give and he that take be glad he aptly remind we of his wife name during the course of his speech congratulate he and be sure we will be see each other again soon without be complacent in any way about the electorate we will not divide the house on this measure give the state of the backlog impact the coronial system this be sensible measure and the opposition will not contest it today however it be worth discuss very briefly the reason for the backlog and the government complete inability to get grip on any aspect of our justice system after year of conservative rule we have significant and in some case record high backlog across the whole of the court and tribunal system victim and their family be wait year for answer and for justice it have become the department of justice delay and we all know what that mean labour will work at pace to tackle the backlog that be grind our justice system to halt and to restore public confidence in the justice system but we do not seek to divide the house on this measure mr speaker hope to catch your eye later in today proceeding in order to thank you and other but now will confine my remark to this measure and to congratulate the hon member for blackpool south chris webb this be sensible measure and be delighted to see my hon friend the minister who be my constituency neighbour at least for couple more day in his place on the treasury bench he will know that the justice committee publish substantial report on coroner some time ago and that we recently do follow up this measure be wise and sensible but there be broad issue that need to be tackle in the coronial system hope that either my hon friend the minister if we come back into government or any future government will look again at our report because the one thing that we have not do and that we need to do be tackle the root problem of the coroner system which be that it be piecemeal and sit outside the rest of the normal judicial framework hope that future government will revisit our recommendation that we should move to national coroner service that would ensure great consistency and that the same service be provide to bereaved family right across the country which be currently not the case it would be small investment but would do the right thing there be of course role for jury particularly in important matter welcome the change that the government have make to the representation of family at inquest but again hope that we can go far particularly where state agency and public body be concerned this be sensible measure in the right direction but hope that we will grasp the nettle and have proper national coroner service something that have be recommend overwhelmingly in the evidence to the justice committee and champion by both chief coroners with whom have have the pleasure of working his honour judge mark lucraft and the recently retire his honour judge thomas teague both have do fantastic job as chief coroners and want to pay tribute to both of they may begin by echo the comment by the chair of the justice committee my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir

of the justice world have no doubt that whatever he do next in his professional career he will continue to make great wave for those who be touch in some way by the justice system as my hon and learn friend say part of the justice committee work have include look at the coronial system first in and more recently last year we have look at all aspect of the coronial system not least the impact that covid have have on its ability to function in the way that we would all want the minister be right to take pragmatic approach by provide some breathing space and capacity within the coronial system so that many of the case that need to move through the court in timely and compassionate way be able to do so as have be allude to there be of course many other issue that need to be address unfortunately due to the sudden end to this parliament the report that the justice committee be on the very cusp of produce for the government will now be in the form of correspondence that have go to the department hope that it will be look at carefully in the next six week by ministers who will still be in post as well as by official who whatever hue the next government happen to be can put it straight on to the table of the next minister hopefully it will still be my hon friend sit on the front bench so that we do not lose any of the momentum that hopefully the report will be able to

and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst touch on the need to look at the potential unification of the service the funding model how it be resource we do not want to imperil the rule of law by make the service unworkable potentially the need for an inspectorate so that we know how well the service be function and as the minister rightly say ensure that we put bereaved family at the very heart of the process hope that this measure will be part of enable many of those change to take hold in the ensue year mr speaker as you will know this be my second time around in parliament

we believe strengthen the intention behind the bill at the outset express my gratitude to the shadow minister the hon member for cardiff west kevin brennan and to the usual channel for their work in very short timeframe to ensure that we be able to proceed with the bill today it be pleasure to serve opposite the shadow minister he know not only the huge respect but the fondness have for he notwithstanding the six week of to and fro that suspect we may have during the election want to put it on the record that genuinely wish he very well for the future on report in the house of lords we strengthen measure on victim to make it clear that compliance with the code be not optional and to bolster measure to hold agency to account for its delivery we also introduce measure to give strong voice to victim of offender whose conditional release be consider by the mental health tribunal to make it clear that victim who have sign non disclosure agreement can make disclosure to much need support service without fear of legal action and to raise the threshold for the disclosure of counselling note for victim so that they can now only be disclose where they be of substantial probative value we also table an amendment in the other place yesterday to create new ground within article of the uk general data protection regulation specifically for the victim of stalking and harassment to

tribute to the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy for raise the issue and campaign on it and to my friend the noble baroness morgan of cotes for pursue it in the other place turn to lords

campaign in seek to expose and tackle this national scandal and ensure that those who have be victim of it receive the support and compensation they deserve the lords amendment do three crucial thing they impose duty on the government to establish uk wide infected blood compensation scheme within three month of royal assent they establish new arm length body name the infected blood compensation authority to deliver the compensation scheme and they impose duty on the government to make interim payment of to the estate of deceased infected people where previous interim payment have not be make be grateful to the minister for all the work that he have do on the amendment but could ask he about the final group who have receive not penny the parent who lose child and the child who lose parent the government have announce an additional for those who be infect to be pay within day there be no timescale for payment to people who have not receive anything yet can he help the house understand when the payment will be make be grateful to the right hon lady and know that the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens have raise similar question previously know that the right hon lady and other be in correspondence with my right hon friend the prime minister and the minister for the cabinet office the question raise be complex and detailed my understanding be that robert francis will be spend june have those conversation with community and with victim and family so that he can work out the detail of the answer to those question from the basis of what those family and community want to see rather than minister or anyone else pre empte that one of the key lesson that and hope the government and this house have take from the work the right hon lady have do be the need to listen to those affect and that be what sir robert will be do do not want to pre empt that from the dispatch box rise suspect that the right hon lady will want to enlarge on the point in her speech but of course will let she come back now be grateful just gently point out to the minister that sir brian langstaff tell the government in april over year ago to get on and make these payment have to say that work could have be undertake in that period to get to the point where payment could be make quickly and it be very regrettable that that have not happen entirely note and the house and country will have hear the point make by the right hon lady she participate in the statement by the prime minister and the subsequent statement by the minister for the cabinet office which set out the work that he have undertake at pace to make thing move forward what we see in this bill be hugely important step forward and look forward to robert francis work at pace to ensure that the view of those affect be genuinely reflect in the detailed answer to the question that the right hon lady have pose the government amendment demonstrate our absolute commitment to deliver long overdue justice to the victim too many people whether they be infect or affect have see their life chance take away watch love one die needlessly and endure the most terrible stigma none of which should ever have happen can only hope that with the inquiry report publish and with our firm commitment to compensate those touch by the scandal the infected blood community know that their cry for justice have finally be hear as have say lot of that be tribute to the right hon lady work the government have also table amendment to make reform to provision on those serve imprisonment and detention sentence for public protection we will be far reduce the qualifying period to two year for those who be convict when age under we will also allow the secretary of state to have discretion to decide that recall should have no effect on the two year automatic licence determination period as well as require that an annual report be lay before parliament on the support for those serve these sentence be grateful to member of both houses for the constructive way in which they have engage with the bill and be delighted that we will be able to complete its passage ahead of prorogation will set out the detail of the motion that we be bring forward today in response to those outstanding issue in respect of lords amendment we be seek to amend the measure on the issuing of guidance about victim support role in clause victim support role operate across different setting some of which be devolve the senedd do not grant legislative consent for this measure as previously draft be therefore table an amendment so that the duty to issue guidance apply to england and reserved matter in wales only have consequently remove the requirement to consult welsh ministers on any guidance issue be grateful for the constructive discussion that have take place in relation to the important principle that sit behind this clause which aim to improve the consistency of support service provide to victim be confident that we can continue to work together so that victim have that consistency across both country lord amendment be technical amendment to move the clause on child victim of domestic abuse to the right part of the bill we have accept the principle of lords amendment which will place duty on relevant authority to co operate with the victims commissioner when request we hear the strength of feeling that response to the victims commissioner as they do their important work should not be see as favour instead there should be clear and open co operation as an integral part of enable the independent scrutiny that victim deserve the government amendment make few minor change first it extend require co operation far than to simply assist the commissioner in monitor compliance with the victim code instead it require co operation in relation to any of the victims commissioner function which include promote the interest of victim and witness secondly it add important safeguard to make clear that any co operation must be not only practical but appropriate this protect against potential interference with activity that be rightly independent such as the exercise of prosecutorial discretion thirdly it future proof the clause by put this duty on the agency that deliver service under the victim code rather than include specific list of body which may become out of date lord amendment seek to require training to be provide to those with obligation under the victim code of course agency should and do have training in place to deliver the legislative duty to act in accordance with the code but that training must be tailor to the specific function that each person be discharge and agency be well place to do that we consider that in place an additional burden on the secretary of state to implement strategy for training this amendment would be costly and inefficient it would not be proper for an amendment from the lords to place financial burden on public authority we also consider that the more effective approach as have be commit by the government in the other place be to include requirement for agency to report on the adequacy of their co training as part of evidence in delivery of code entitlement this give we route to identify and address ineffective training if it have lead to non compliance with the code lord amendment seek to establish an immigration firewall and prevent the police from share with immigration enforcement datum relate to immigration status we disagree with this amendment because it would be inappropriate to impose blanket restriction on the use of personal datum in the circumstance to which the amendment relate it would not prevent the perpetrator from inform immigration enforcement about the victim immigration status and would impact on the ability to investigate crime and support victim lord amendment seek to place statutory duty of candour on all public authority public servant and official after major incident have be declare in writing by the secretary of state the government share the desire to see an end to unacceptable institutional defensiveness but we can not accept the amendment in the current form because it would not sit neatly on top of the exist framework it be not well suited to replace what already exist for major incident and beyond it do not take into account the nuance of different profession in the sphere of the public sector and it could entail significant legal uncertainty this be complex area so we believe that it would be unwise to rush forward with an amendment but we have table an amendment in lieu to require statutory review to determine whether additional duty of transparency and candour should be impose on public authority and public servant in relation to major incident the review will need to be complete by the end of the calendar year and follow its completion report will be lay before the government it will be for whichever government be elect in six week time to determine what to do with that we be also bring forward an amendment in lieu of lords amendment and the government amendment will ensure that those convict of control or coercive behaviour who be sentence to at least month imprisonment will be automatically subject to management under multi agency public protection arrangement or mappa that will ensure that we effectively manage and target the most dangerous domestic abuse offender previous amendment be table in the other place to add domestic abuse and stalk perpetrator to those who qualify for automatic mappa management although there be legal definition of domestic abuse specific domestic abuse crime do not exist with the exception of control or coercive behaviour therefore although well intentione the amendment would still have require criminal justice agency to decide case by case whether defendant be eligible for mappa management consequently the amendment would have not achieve the intention of reduce or eliminate any scope for local discretion there be already provision in place require offender on licence to live only at an address approve by probation far all offender release on licence be subject to standard condition for the duration of their sentence there be numerous additional licence condition that can be impose to address specific risk factor licence condition allow for information on perpetrator to be collect and use to manage risk the amendment would therefore have little impact on public safety but would result in significant resourcing pressure for police force offender who perpetrate other form of domestic abuse such as threat to kill actual and grievous bodily harm attempt strangulation put people in fear of violence and stalk include stalk that involve fear of violence serious alarm or distress be already automatically manage under mappa if sentence to month custody or more add the additional offence of control and coercive behaviour will ensure that the most harmful domestic abuse offender will be automatically cover by the arrangement the change will mean that those offender will automatically be manage in the same way as those convict of sexual violent and terrorist offence that be crucial as control or coercive behaviour be know risk factor for domestic homicide treat those offender in the same way as the most violent offender be critical to improve the safety of domestic abuse victim lord amendment would permit the secretary of state to re release recall ipp imprisonment for public protection prisoner and mirror the power of the secretary of state to re release recall offender serve determinate sentence that be now refer to as risk assess recall review or rarr that be an executive power and it will be for the secretary of state to decide if or when to use it the amendment also enable the secretary of state to impose licence condition on recall ipp offender licence if the secretary of state use the power to release they on licence we agree that that be the right approach but we have table government amendment in lieu to make that change together with further measure relate to release that come under the scope of the clause government amendment in lieu extend the eligibility of the home detention curfew scheme to offender serve sentence of four year or over the original aim of the scheme be to help suitable low risk offender who have be in custody to reintegrate in society in control manner as sentence have become long it be important to revisit whether eligibility for hdc continue to allow all those who may be suitable and whose rehabilitation may benefit from the scheme to be consider as originally intend that mean look again at whether offender who be exclude solely due to sentence length or old curfew breach rather than due to any assessment of risk should be consider in the usual way for hdc since hdc be introduce sentence have grow long and they should no long be the sole determinant of whether someone be eligible to be consider for hdc four year sentence length or an old curfew breach be very blunt measure of whether an offender be low risk or suitable for hdc the amendment increase the number of offender eligible for hdc but do not extend the range of offence that make an offender eligible for it all sexual offender and serious violent offender be exclude from the scheme as be those subject to parole board release those convict of offence that be often associate with domestic abuse such as stalking and harassment be also exclude as be many other people include category prisoner there be also robust risk assessment to ensure that offender be release only if there be plan in place to manage they safely in the community in every case that include curfew back up by electronic monitoring finally lords amendment be technical amendment to move the location of the clause head child victim of domestic abuse to the right part of the bill would like to take this opportunity to put on record my gratitude to the clerks the shadow minister and all my official who have work on this important piece of legislation nikki jones katie morris donna bromyard elizabeth bates isla scott emily

and model of what many of we should aspire to have be minister and know what difficult job it be and what difference it make to have minister in department who take parliament and what members of parliament say seriously do their good to accommodate opinion and measure suggest by other members of parliament and do not think that the government have monopoly on wisdom or on measure when they bring bill to this house the minister be prepared to engage in debate and consider amendment and thank he for the way in which he conduct himself in this place as she be in her place will mention the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken some member may be aware that many year ago she be pupil at radyr comprehensive school when be teacher there so do not think that she would leave the house before or be conservative indeed be obviously lousy teacher as she end up conservative member of parliament but wish she well in the future as she leave this place also send my well wish to the chair of the justice committee the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill who be friend from across the house and who conduct himself in manner that we can all aspire to as we stand here at this critical point we be remind of how significant the bill be be pleased that the government have come to their sens and give the british public the opportunity to go to the poll and have their say on who will run the country but that should not come at the expense of victim that be why we welcome the discussion hold through the usual channel that allow we to arrive at what we have today we will support the measure outline by the minister victim have wait for over eight year and eight justice secretaries for legislation address the failure and injustice that they face support victim be priority for labour in the spirit of bring forward the overdue change to our criminal justice system and begin the work of try to restore public confidence in it we be pleased to support the bill we have strive to be collaborative throughout and think the minister have acknowledge that we recognise the government willingness to negotiate in the final hour of this parliament take this opportunity to acknowledge the exemplary effort of my predecessor who do most of the heavy lifting on the bill before take on this role my constituency neighbour and hon friend the member for cardiff north anna mcmorrin and my hon friend the member for lewisham west and penge ellie reeves also extend my thank to the minister for the cordial and constructive approach he have take throughout the bill progress the labour party be resolute in its commitment to put victim back at the heart of the criminal justice system and we recognise the importance of not only listen to they but go far and deliver robust support to they empower they and enhance their right on the duty to collaborate with the victims commissioner it be hearten to know that the hard work conduct in opposition do sometimes get recognise and be use for the benefit of the public the success of lords amendment which introduce duty to collaborate with the victims commissioner be perfect example of the effort exert by the opposition pay off labour have be clear that it be imperative that we strengthen the power of the victims commissioner although we seek to go far than we have be able to while in opposition we recognise that the new duty on justice agency to co operate with the holder of the commissioner role be useful start we remain committed to recognise the significance of the victims commissioner and the desperate need for that office to be strengthen it be long past time for the system to be truly accountable for the need of victim not be meet so we be glad that we be take this step towards have fully empower victims commissioner we have listen to the call of previous commissioner and victim support service and will continue to do so we be firmly committed to far strengthen to commissioner power should we have the privilege of sit on the treasury benches in few week time on part of the bill and the provision concern the victim of major incident we be pleased to see through lords amendment that our colleague in the other place understand the importance of the introduction of duty of candour for public body thank my colleague in the other place for their hard work and particularly lord ponsonby our front bench representative for his evidently persuasive contribution when move the amendment welcome the statutory review that the minister announce which be provide for in the government amendment labour be committed to introduce statutory duty of candour it be as simple as that and we be absolutely committed to ensure that public authority and official co operate with official investigation in the wake of public disaster as they should if they be to act in the public interest in the wake of several high profile and devastating miscarriage of justice this be more important than ever only then can we ensure that we end evasive and obstructive practice follow state relate death although to date we have be deal with government who have drag their foot bit on this issue hope the minister do not mind my say that we have at last have the opportunity to secure agreement in the bill and it now remain only to finalise the all important last detail of how that duty of candour will work in practice labour will work on that from our early day in government if we win the election we will make this change on the infected blood scandal it would be remiss not to refer to my constituent sue sparkes who visit the house this week she be at first it could be describe as elate by sir brian langstaff report but she then describe to how she become deflate as the government make their statement to the house regard compensation be in complete agreement with my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson whom work with on this issue for many year long before take my current role she be absolutely right in what she say remember both she and year ago from the back benches call on the government to get on with the design and payment of these compensation payment to the victim too be very sad that that work have not be do in the meantime it would appear be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way with his typical generosity do he agree that it be now important to move quickly the cabinet office need to meet and engage with the infected and affected community to make sure the compensation payment be right and to ensure that the community be represent on the compensation authority board the hon gentleman be right as he often be completely endorse his remark thank he for the he will pay to charity after lose bet with that there would be referendum on scottish independence by the end of this parliament put that on record not because do not trust he but because say that would send he the name of the charity after today debate he be man of honour and man of his word so know he will pay up on serious point thank the hon gentleman for his contribution on this important issue his background in the trade union movement mean that he will always be thoughtful about the essential job of help the weak against the strong which be what we be try to do in this place should also pay proper tribute to my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north few month ago her amendment to hold the government foot to the fire on this issue cause they to suffer possibly their only defeat in this house during this parliament which be quite an achievement to echo sir brian langstaff we must tackle the lack of openness transparency and candour that have leave victim suffer for decade we welcome the movement towards this important milestone and we look forward to see victim get the financial redress they deserve soon rather than later should say that les the husband of my constituent sue sparkes die in as result of receive infected blood there have be lot of discussion and work involve colleague from all party to recognise the considerable concern surround sentence of imprisonment for public protection ipp be and be stain on our nation criminal justice system and we have acknowledge our role in the past it be right that ipp sentence be abolish and we share the concern that lie behind many of the proposal suggest by colleague both here and in the other place in relation to these sentence and prisoner we have continually seek to work on this issue constructively and on cross party basis wherever possible which be why we be pleased to support multiple government concession on this matter include lords amendment and agree to new annual report and provision for those sentence to detention for public protection pay tribute to our colleague lord blunkett who have do great deal of work perhaps to underdo some of the thing he might have be responsible for many year ago progress for those remain on ipp sentence and on licence in the community be pivotal we want to ensure that any solution propose be robust and assess with public safety properly in mind as the minister rightly say in government labour will work at pace to make progress and will consult widely to ensure that our action for those on ipp sentence be effective in their interest and base on the evidence in front of we on the mappa issue in the bill we be glad to have agree on an overdue and important change in the arrangement in place to protect victim and the public from the terrible blight on our society that be domestic abuse when the bill pass offender sentence to more than month for the offence of control or coercive behaviour will now be automatically include in the multi agency regime that exist for violent and sexual offender that follow strong support in the other place for more rigorous safeguard in such case where too often we see woman in particular leave to face repeat and escalate pattern of abuse within the relationship where they should be most safe labour have big ambition in government to tackle violence against woman and girl in particular far beyond the commitment in the bill but we be nevertheless proud to have put this marker down and to support this measure labour commitment to reform the criminal justice system to ensure that victim be more than just bit player be unwavering we be pleased to have support and help to improve the bill our essential addition from empower the victims commissioner to introduce duty of candour for public body have highlight our commitment to the rightful place of victim at the centre of the justice process we welcome the government movement in the right direction on pivotal issue such as ipp and on the infected blood compensation authority notwithstanding the remark make about the slowness of movement to get compensation out to victim thank the minister for his openness in accept some of these change look forward to the bill conclusion very shortly hope and hope that the act will be step towards new era of transparency and advocacy for all victim of crime call the chair of the justice committee madam deputy speaker as we leave the house together may start by wish you the very good for the future remember as keen young opposition spokesman be your shadow when you be local government minister and

of london and westminster nickie aiken we have be around the block literally in various local government campaign in london over many year it be certain irony that we have all decide to depart at the same time that will probably be cause for good lunch at some point have not forget that owe the minister one as well pay tribute to the minister for his approach totally agree with the shadow minister to whom be also grateful he have be good friend in relation to this and to issue about the perform art and music which we have both champion in this place as well as the snp spokesman the minister have be exemplary in his approach we be fortunate in the team of ministers that we currently have at the ministry of justice include he and my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state and lord chancellor although he be not here today his name be on the amendment who be quite exceptional lawyer quite exceptional lord chancellor star in this chamber and somebody whose integrity and commitment to the legal system will be long recognise these be improvement to the bill be glad about that may also thank the ministry of justice official have deal with many of they over the year be sorry that they have have to put up with some of the thing that the justice committee have lob at they over that time but there have always be great constructive spirit in that context particularly welcome the fact that the government have take on board number of the select committee recommendation in relation to our pre legislative scrutiny of what be then simply the victims bill and become the victims and prisoners bill as well as some although not all of our recommendation in relation to ipp prisoner more on that in moment the scrutiny of the victims bill be particularly lead by the right hon member for garston and halewood maria eagle who serve as my deputy on the committee before she be rightly recall to the opposition front bench thank she too for the support she give on the committee and the particular work she do for her constituent and for well and fair approach for victim in these case also congratulate the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson whom first meet when we be both elect to the london assembly in for the exceptional work she have do in relation to infected blood we can work cross party on these matter and she have perform great service in relation to some of the remain part of the bill be glad the government have move on the matter set out here the co operation with the commissioner be good news and think we all know that the duty of candour be valuable and to be welcome perhaps it could go far but let we accept it be step in the right direction the use of public protection and power in relation to the recall of prisoner and the extension of home curfew be sensible measure home curfew be important will say it yet again because may not have another chance to do so we need to be more intelligent as society in the way we use imprisonment which be expensive and the way we use it at the moment be not always effective alternative tool in the sentencing box include the use of home detention curfew enable we to get well approach to balance punishment which be legitimate with rehabilitation which be what we have to aim for if we be to reduce reoffende if we want to reduce the number of victim of crime we want to reduce reoffende home detention curfew and other measure be valuable step towards do that they be by no mean the whole answer but any advance be to be welcome regret that in the wash up we do not have the sentencing bill because that would have take many more valuable step towards more balanced and rational approach to sentencing policy hope whoever be in government after the general election will return to the issue in the sentencing bill not least because many of they have cross party support the campaign on ipp prisoner have attract massive cross party support both here and in the other house our committee take compelling evidence on it and in particular want to thank those who champion it in the other place include my good friend lord moylan and lord blunkett wish the government have go far and introduce the resentence exercise proposal put forward powerfully by lord thomas of cwmgiedd the former lord chief justice still think there be merit in that would like to end by pay tribute to someone who sadly can not hear the word because yesterday be at middle temple for the memorial service to the late lord brown of eaton under heywood one of the most exceptional man have ever meet he be an exceptional lawyer one of the last of the lords of appeal in ordinary the law lords and one of the first of the supreme court at an age when many would be put their foot up he be regularly in the house of lords until month before he die he regularly champion the case of ipp prisoner and coin the phrase stain on our criminal justice report house of lords september vol those be simon word he will be pleased up wherever he be to have hear the word from the minister that there will be movement but hope that one day we will return to the simon brown memorial amendment the resentence exercise amendment that exceptional person who inspire and many other and his family will deserve that because if it be possible to be both lawyer and public figure and great human being simon brown epitomise that and that be something we can perhaps all learn from call the snp spokesperson it be pleasure to follow the chair of the justice committee the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill and wish he all the good for the future and thank he for the work he do as committee chair one of his memorable moment in the last few month be to chair the committee sit in which and my hon and learn friend the member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry be push the issue of the horizon postmaster in scotland and what that mean for we that be very intelligent session with many legal expert and he chair it in an exemplary way that allow the debate to continue have always find he to be one of the more interesting member of the house when it come to discuss such matter and very fair wish he all the good also wish you madam deputy speaker all the good for the future like the hon member for cardiff west kevin brennan be go to name you as my favourite deputy speaker you always use to tease that have glint in my eye before be ready to speak in the chamber and would always be coy when you suggest be go to be speak next genuinely give you my good wish and thank you for all the kindness you have show as an individual and all the encouragement you give all hon member of the house in carry out our duty both to our constituent and here in the chamber what an amazing week it have be it be suggest that this bill might not make the wash up if that have be the case there would have be an almighty furore from the infected and affected community think pressure be apply by member in this house members in the other place and indeed the campaigner to ensure that we get the bill over the line be go to confine my observation to the amendment relate to the infected blood compensation scheme and set up the infected blood compensation authority which welcome also welcome as do early in the week the excellent appointment of sir robert francis as head of the authority and of the compensation board like many other member be here to fulfil constituent commitment in particular to cathy young and her two daughter nicola and lisa it be one of my first constituency case cathy young come to see at darnley community centre have know bit about the issue in scotland we have the penrose inquiry which be untidy to say the least but get more and more interested and more and more passionate because it be clear injustice as the hon member for cardiff west suggest be great believer that when it be time for an election you do not shy away from it but do think that some of the event of the past couple of day have be pity on monday when my constituent cathy young be down here in london along with her daughter think some people in the government know that the general election be go to be call two day later do not believe that the paymaster general do but when he be on his foot deliver statement about what the compensation scheme would look like believe that some people in the government know that the election be go to be call the very next day we be in an unfortunate position in that there be now lot of question that need answer and clarify before parliament be dissolve be go to raise some of they in my speech because we do seem to be in bit of flux which be pity be go to take this opportunity on behalf of my constituent and the infected blood community who have take member of this house to their heart as we have take they to our heart first accord to the scheme and the discussion that have take place with the cabinet office it look as though the parent of deceased infected child will receive the same amount as those of live infected child that do not seem right to and think it need to be clarify there be also no mention of variant creutzfeldt jakob disease infection among all this paperwork lot of clarity be need on the confusion between what be widow payment and what be an estate payment the expectation appear to be that widow will distribute the money pay as an estate payment but unfortunately that might be difficult give the sad reality of life that some family do not speak to each other for all sort of reason it be suggest that widow would receive which seem to be less than they receive at present the government be also suggest that the support scheme payment will end which be leave lot of people distressed and very worried about lose those monthly payment we need clarity and more discussion with the infected and affect blood community to ease some of those concern we also need clarity about individual head of loss for the infected because frankly we all seem to be in the dark the uplift for psychological effect have also be omit will that be cover by the injury impact award at the moment that be not clear so that be something else that we would want to discuss there need to be discussion about what psychological support service there should be go forward because this have be difficult and emotional week for many people lastly this be very important if people accept the interim payment of do that mean they be accept all the compensation value that be currently on the uk government website it seem to that we need lot of clarity and lot more discussion welcome the fact that the authority have be set up and that this place have force the government to move on the issue this have be the house at its good just as many conservative members vote for the amendment table by my good friend the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson as do members in other part of the house this be collective cross party attempt to address this injustice hope that those question will be answer either in writing or in discussion with the infected and affected blood community because we be all here to make sure that they get the justice they so richly deserve any further delay will mean justice deny it be real pleasure to follow my friend the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens want to say big personal thank you to he for all his excellent work over the year on the issue of infected blood and for the important role he have play in the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood to get to where we be this week also want to comment on the remark of the chair of the justice committee the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill be very sad that he be leave the house have look up to he as an excellent role model for how to chair select committee with grace and charm but also with steel he have not shy away from the effective scrutiny that be so vital to the functioning of this house through the select committee system wish he all the very good for what he go on to do next as we be talk about select committees wonder whether could also pay tribute to the member of the home affairs committee some of whom might not return to this house wish they all the very good for all the work

privilege of chair it in particular want to mention jo dodd our current clerk david weir who be our previous clerk and mariam keating the second clerk who step up when we need she to during an interregnum between our first clerks thank all of they the remark that want to make about the lords amendment be very much in the spirit of what have be say about the infected blood scandal as the hon member for glasgow south west say what week this have be we start on monday with the report from sir brian langstaff which follow six year of evidence hear by the independent public inquiry which be absolutely damn about the role play by doctor the nhs and the state and vindication of all those who have campaign over the decade finally we have the truth there be lot of ghost in that room in westminster central hall lot of people who should have be there be not want to pay tribute to someone get to know nick sainsbury who live just outside hull and have be pupil at treloar boarding school he be haemophiliac and have be infect with hepatitis and hiv as young boy he spend his life campaign to try to find out what have happen and to get justice very sadly he die last year before the final report be publish and before he could see the start of justice for those who have be infect and affect also want to pay tribute to my constituent glenn wilkinson who start all this off for back in at time very similar to this general election have just be call and be hold my final surgery as an mp and he come to see although have since learn that he be so disillusioned with everything that he almost do not come to see say if be re elect in the next parliament will try to help you that be what start my year journey work with glenn and so many other on this campaign finally want to say big thank you to caroline wheeler the political editor of the sunday times who have relentlessly use her position as journalist to shine light on this issue she have write book and throughout all of this she have be make sure that politician can not forget what happen and can not forget this search for justice let now turn to the lords amendment thank members of the other place and the ministers and shadow ministers for all the work they have do but want to remind the house how we end up with this section of the bill on december last year this house defeat the government with vote to why do that happen it happen because in april sir brian langstaff have produce his second interim report in which he say that in all conscience he could not wait to tell the government that they need to start to pay compensation he say that wrong be do on individual collective and systemic level and that people be die we know that currently people be die at rate of one person every three and half day parliament defeat the government and be very proud of this parliament for do that because the government be not do what they should have do parliament make they act and put this provision into the bill that be what start the whole process and it be important to note that it be cross party do need to curtail my remark madam deputy speaker be conscious of the fact that the debate must finish at absolutely agree with everything that my hon friend the member for glasgow south west have say about the question that still need to be answer one point that want to raise concern sir robert francis and the engagement that will take place in the next few week legal representation be need so that people can engage fully with that process and ensure that they be feed in the issue about tariff which have cause great deal of concern and worry we also need to get on with provide psychological service in england we have they in scotland wales and northern ireland but we now need they in england and hope the minister will take that message back the other key issue be that of support payment want to associate myself with everything that have be say about infected blood also want to call to the attention of this house the cross party work on lords amendment particularly by baroness morgan baroness finn baroness brinton baroness thornton lord ponsonby and lord russell to protect victim of malicious harassment thank the minister and his team he know that this have be an issue that many of we have be vex about because we have be victim of it ourselves he have be patient and he recognise that we could not simply say this will happen again and that we need to put something into law in that sense pay tribute to all the lawyer and expert on stalk who have assist we and we can not let the bill go through this place without acknowledge the work of the victim commissioner for london claire waxman who be sit in the gallery this afternoon and who have tirelessly fight for victim legislation have few question about lords amendment would not be take part in the debate if do not the amendment be about stop harassment at the moment even if somebody who make malicious complaint be convict it be not clear to many datum controller that because the record have be create by process of malice they should be delete as consequence victim find themselves be pursue base on those record and the amendment would give people direct right to request deletion the minister will know there be concern that some of the exemption could be broad will he commit to give clarity on when those exemption can not be use for malicious complaint as be do in the other house and to give protection to victim who be target in this way many of we in the public realm will be target we have an election come up and we know that this will happen many of we want to face public scrutiny but our family should not have to pay for the price for it which be what so often happen with these record could the minister commit to provide formal guidance be afraid the minister will not have time to sum up but be sure that he will be in touch if there be anything he wish to add one hour have elapse since the commencement of proceeding on the lords amendment the debate be interrupt order may the deputy speaker put forthwith the question already propose from the chair standing order no that the amendment be make government amendment make to lords amendment the deputy speaker then put forthwith the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be conclude at that time standing order no government amendment and make to lords amendment lord amendment as amend agree to government amendment make to lords amendment lord amendment as amend agree to lords amendment disagree to government amendment make in lieu of lords amendment lord amendment and disagree to government amendment make in lieu of lords amendment lord amendment and disagree to government amendment make in lieu of lords amendment and lord amendment disagree to government amendment and make in lieu of lords amendment lord amendment to to to to to and to agree to with commons financial privilege waive in respect of lords amendment to and order that committee be appoint to draw up reason to be assign to the lords for disagree with their amendment and that edward argar scott mann aaron bell paul holmes chris elmore andrew western and chris stephens be member of the committee that edward argar be the chair of the committee that three be the quorum of the committee that the committee do withdraw immediately joy morrissey committee to withdraw immediately reason to be report and communicate to the lords energy beg to move that the draft energy act consequential amendments regulations which be lay before this house on may be approve this instrument be technical in nature it use the power in section of the energy act to make various amendment as consequence of the passing of that act the majority of the amendment relate to the independent system operator and planner or isop while most other relate to the governance of the gas and electricity code there be other minor amendment to the provision relate to the hydrogen levy competition in onshore electricity project and heat network the isop will be an expert and impartial body with responsibility across the electricity and gas system to provide progress towards net zero while maintain energy security and minimise cost for consumer with role across the energy system the isop will help to plan and deliver the integrate system need to ensure our energy security net zero and affordability goal it will be independent not only of other commercial energy interest but from the operational control of the government mean that it will be in position to use its expertise to advice the government and ofgem on the critical decision ahead two type of amendment be need to give the isop stable legislative footing the first be to reflect its public nature shift from the current ownership by national grid by for example add the isop to the list of organisation to which the freedom of information and public record act apply the second reflect the fact that unlike the current electricity system operator which hold transmission licence the isop will hold an electricity system operator licence and gas system planner licence that will require update in energy legislation to ensure that reference be make to the new isop licence which will ensure continuity example include update the energy act so that the isop can continue the eso current work as the contract for difference counter party it be worth note that none of these change will come into effect until the isop be create and current legislative reference will remain whilst the eso continue to operate the electricity system change will also be make in legislation in relation to code governance reform the competition and markets authority have previously highlight concern regard certain aspect of code governance under the new system the exist code administrator and industry planner will be replace by code manager who will be select and license by ofgem those code manager will be directly accountable to ofgem and their responsibility will include make recommendation and in some case decision on modification to the code this statutory instrument enact the necessary consequential change across legislation to reflect the new governance framework and licensing regime an amendment to the gas northern ireland order be make to ensure that the right primary legislation be in place should the government decide to introduce the hydrogen gas shipper levy in northern ireland commend the regulation to the house will start my brief remark with few word about my hon friend the member for southampton test dr whitehead who would ordinarily be speak to this motion and be stand down at the election appreciate that brief remark and few word be not phrase that we would usually associate with my hon friend but there be good reason for that he be one of those parliamentarian who have really deep knowledge of his subject and be completely across his brief he have campaign on these issue for many year in this place and have play vital role in inform labour policy for the future whenever meet stakeholder during my brief tenure in the energy and net zero team it be very clear that he be widely respect by everybody in energy and net zero as well as across this house we wish he all the very good for the future parliament will miss his expertise and his commitment to tackle climate change turn to the motion we do not intend to object to this instrument as the measure be generally consequential to element of the energy act which we support the creation of new body isop now the national energy system operator be essential to manage and plan the expansion and operation of our energy system as we transition to net zero labour call for the creation of this body as system architect we have be encourage by the early step the current electricity system operator have make in prepare for its new role we therefore agree that establish its legislative basis fully be an urgent priority and be glad we have manage to address that in the wash up we also have no objection to the new governance framework for gas and electricity code we support establish the ofgem license code manager role as it be sensible improvement to the current system give the importance of gas and electricity code to the smooth technical operation of our energy system other miscellaneous amendment in this statutory instrument include those make as result of the energy act provision to regulate heat network and create heat network zone heat network regulation have for too long be blind spot and some consumer have have to pay significantly high bill as result so emphasise again how important these new regulation be and hope that we can make sure they be in force as soon as possible in the next parliament whatever composition it might have finally madam deputy speaker let say that you be my favourite deputy speaker thank you for your service to this house and to the people of doncaster and for the great support you have give to in my nine year here and to many labour colleague we all wish you all the very good for the future call the scottish national party spokesperson please accept my apology for not put in to speak on this measure madam deputy speaker you will understand that it have be hectic couple of day and therefore hop that my bobbing would be sufficient obviously the snp be not go to oppose this measure we support the need for energy reform when we look at the inflation figure we see that they be so heavily influence by the cost of energy market reform have be overdue for quite long time particularly in respect of heat network give as the opposition spokesperson mention the increase in their amount in my constituency we have aberdeen heat power an incredible and well embed heat network that supply significant number of council property in the city would go as far as to say that it be one of the lead heat network because of the sheer number of property it be able to supply it give cheap energy to those property which be incredibly important we have make the case as have significant number of campaigner on thing such as stand charge particularly for electricity and gas we have raise the concern about the energy price cap and the fact that it do not give reduction in that respect we be aware that in october we be again likely to see an increase in the energy price and that people who have manage to find thing little easy over the summer may find they even more difficult this winter because of the potential for increase we will continue to make the case the minister would assume that will that scotland have the power when it come to energy but we do not have the power to make the change that we would like to see to ensure fair deal across these island when people pay for electricity and gas be talk about the price people be pay in their home when those bill come through the door we be see high level of stand change in scotland and of charge for organisation look to connect to the grid frankly we do not think that situation be fair and we would like to see change make however we be pleased to see that the government be move towards reform and that this si have be include in the wash up process it be good to see the government prioritise it appreciate that the minister have push for it and have take the time to move it today let briefly sum up first let associate myself with the remark make by the hon member for manchester withington jeff smith about you madam deputy speaker and about the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead as whip stand in as minister do not think would be reveal any secret to say that he have sometimes be source of frustration for those on the treasury bench however we could never doubt his level of detailed knowledge and his commitment to public service and we wish he the very good in the future also thank the hon member for manchester withington and the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman for indicate the support of those on the opposition benches for these regulation the hon gentleman will not realise this but many year ago he be my local councillor when live in south manchester and always enjoy get his leaflet through my door as have say while broadly administrative in nature these change will be vital for the creation of the isop for energy code reform and the continued development of the energy sector towards net zero finally these may well be my final few word in this house this be as they say it serve in this place be an honour and privilege that few experience have do my good it be all that anybody can do question put and agree to tribunal and inquiries beg to move that the tribunal procedure upper tribunal immigration and asylum chamber amendment rules si no date may copy of which be lay before this house on may be approve this statutory instrument form part of the government preparation for the implementation of the illegal migration act which will hereafter refer to as the ima the si deliver the tribunal procedural necessary to implement the new appeal regime for suspensive claim already approve in parliament in section to of the ima the rule have be draft to give effect to the timing set out in the ima exceptionally under the ima in order to provide for swift implementation section provide that the lord chancellor instead of the tribunal procedure committee be responsible for make the first set of rule for the upper tribunal immigration and asylum chamber for the purpose of suspensive claim under section to of the ima this reflect parliament recognition of the importance of implement the act rapidly to tackle illegal migration as the lord chancellor power to make rule have now be spend with the laying of this si the tribunal procedure committee retain its rule make power and will be able to amend or replace these rule as it deem appropriate under its usual procedure we have keep the tpc fully inform throughout our work in prepare the draft rule and we also understand that the tpc will review these rule as part of its priority to keep all nine set of tribunal procedural and employment tribunal procedural under constant review before conclude this be the last time will address the chamber from the dispatch box as justice minister this side of the election on that basis and hope you will indulge madam deputy speaker would like to thank all of the official and special adviser that have work with in my time as an under secretary of state at the ministry of justice particularly harry mcneill adams andrew spence molly parsons claire fielder christina pride catherine elkington tim coates amy rees ross gribbin gemma hewison and jenny pickrell would also like to thank the excellent special adviser sally rushton rupert cunningham and hannah galley finally and most importantly would like to thank my private secretary who have work tirelessly to keep organise and on the straight and narrow charlotte hewitt andrea benjamin imogen jailler and naomi hartley also thank you madam deputy speaker you have be beacon of fairness and good humour in the chair throughout my time in this house wish you well in your retirement you will be much miss by this house and the house will be the poor without you to conclude these rule will come into force on commencement of the duty to remove under section of the illegal migration act the lord chancellor lay this si on may in preparation for that have already lay the civil legal aid remuneration amendment regulations and the civil legal aid financial resources and payment for services and remuneration amendment regulations late last year by do so the si will be in place should the decision be take after the election to proceed with the swift implementation of the ima can see that be not your only fan in this chamber madam deputy speaker be sure that speak for everyone in say that we wish you well in what you do we be also join by the former prime minister the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may we thank she for exemplary public service in her time in this place also pay tribute to my dear friend my right hon and learn friend the member for camberwell and peckham ms harman the mother of the house who have have an extraordinary career as labour politician she be briefly all too briefly in my view the leader of the party thank she for her service to the labour party to parliament and to our country the statutory instrument govern one of the few part of the prime minister so call signature immigration legislation to have actually be enact the illegal migration act most of the key clause include the duty to remove those who arrive without permission have not be enact because the government know deep down that the act be bit of sham it be the second of three act design but fail to tackle the small boat chaos under their watch we oppose that act because we warn that it would not work and the government reluctance to enact any of its key provision show that we be right the provision in the statutory instrument govern the appeal procedure relate to removal under the act but no such removal be occur as the duty to remove have not even be enact the truth be that the government have lose control of our border security they have allow criminal gang to take hold of the channel and they have allow dangerous boat crossing to soar they have lose control of the asylum system allow decision to collapse and the backlog to rocket to record high with record number of people in asylum hotel which cost the taxpayer an eye water million day meanwhile yesterday statistic show that they have let return and enforcement crumble too with return of fail asylum seeker down by compare with the last labour government we will strengthen our border security and fix the asylum chaos we will crack down on the criminal gang and their supply chain to stop the boat before they reach the french coast we will set up new border security command back by new resource and counter terrorism style power to bring those gang to justice we will clear the backlog with new fast track procedure for safe country and end asylum hotel use to save the taxpayer billion of pound we will also strengthen enforcement with new return and enforcement unit we do not intend to divide the house but the british public will have their say on july it will be choice between gimmick from the tories and strong border security and real grip from labour make comment yesterday but would like briefly to thank you madam deputy speaker for your time in the chair whenever have make request you have either grant it or give very good reason why it be not reasonable request which really appreciate as snp members have lay out on numerous occasion we have many issue with the uk government immigration policy especially the rwanda policy we fundamentally disagree with the decision make process that be happen and with the ideology from the snp benches we can say on behalf of the people of scotland this be not be do in our name because they fundamentally disagree with this hon member will know what happen on kenmure street glasgow couple of year ago the people of glasgow on behalf of the people of scotland stand up for one of our own who be be take away it do not matter to we where that person be bear if somebody want to come and be part of scottish society if they want to come and live in our country bring their skill talent and culture and contribute to scotland that be welcome in scotland this policy be not be do in our name understand that the statutory instrument be part of the government preparation in relation to the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act which we disagree with at every stage it be disappointing that labour members be use the same rhetoric and play the same game as the tories on this issue they be talk about small boat at every opportunity but they should be talk about the issue that actually matter to people they be fundamentally misunderstand the public view in scotland people in scotland do not wake up every morning and worry about the small boat crossing that be not the big issue they be worry about the cost of living crisis the nhs and their daily life they support immigration policy that allow people to come one of the good thing about the general election be call be that the change to graduate visa can not be implement the migration advisory committee report say that the graduate visa should continue but understandably we have no faith in this tory government allow that to happen the change relate to dependant will have significant impact on so many place particularly when it come to university number of which might actually go under as result of the decision be make by the uk tory government we have history in scotland of oppose tory immigration policy and oppose crackdown that simply demonise innocent people who be try to escape unimaginably bad situation we have fight against dawn raid we have have the glasgow girl we have have huge amount of civic action against take our people away the shadow minister mention the immigration backlog it would be much well if the uk government focus on ensure that the immigration system work and that people who have apply for visa get decision within year or year and half or even think about some of the casework have face within three year it would be much well if they do not randomly move people from hotel in aberdeen to hotel in glasgow while also move other from hotel in glasgow to hotel in aberdeen it would be much well if they do not move people in aberdeen who be wait for an operation to london or another place in england with absolutely no notice and no justification apart from the fact that they get free legal advice in scotland give that the law and the legal system be different in the two country people who be move to england have to restart their asylum case from scratch our long hold position be that we oppose the conservatives rhetoric and ideology on immigration and we oppose the rwanda policy in particular so we will divide the house on this motion and vote against it interruption it be the last day of the parliament we be not go to compromise our principle simply because that would be more convenient for the labour party we be go to stick by they act consistently with all the position we have hold previously and vote against the motion first pay tribute to the hon member for cardiff west kevin brennan who have be my shadow for what feel like lot long than seven month be not completely convince by his claim of strong border under labour be sure that the electorate will sort that out in the next few week but he have be extremely decent in his dealing with apologise should have thank the minister for the courteous way in which he have deal with the opposition spokespeople do thank he for that for the benefit of the people in the strangers gallery should say that it be not normal for politician to be so nice to each other across the dispatch box it get lot bad than this normally be very grateful to the hon gentleman for his word will the minister give way on the topic of be nice be really not sure that should sully no of course will appreciate that this be perhaps one of the most contentious bit of legislation that we have to deal with in the wash up but want to thank the minister for the constructive approach that he have always adopt towards the business and in particular for the way that he have engage with the justice committee which have chair on number of difficult issue over his time in post be extremely grateful to my hon and learn friend my constituency neighbour for his kind word have know he for more than year if the house will indulge first meet he when he defeat my wife in the selection for the bexley and bromley london assembly constituency we overcome that particular bump in the road very swiftly and he have very much be guide light and mentor for in the quarter of century that have elapse since he be somebody who have consistently look up to perhaps not physically but certainly in every other sense be grateful for the opportunity to close this debate there will be lot of valedictory speech and my right hon friend the member for nuneaton mr jones will lead off on those but would like to personally mark this point many hon and right hon member be retire from the house today as be inevitable when an election come around pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may she have be an exceptional public servant over her year in this house take into account her local government experience in the london borough of merton her public service extend for more than three decade in my humble opinion she personify all that be good about public servant with her

mother of the house who have long record in this chamber than do pay tribute in particular to the way she have champion the cause of woman in this place and woman issue more generally throughout her time in the house it have be pleasure latterly perhaps in our early day we do not work together quite so well to champion those issue together while be talk about woman in this house may take this opportunity to say to you madam deputy speaker and to the chairman of ways and means my right hon friend the member for epping forest dame eleanor laing what pleasure it have be to have you both in that chair and to thank you for the good humour and kindness but also firmness when necessary with which you have deal with our proceeding wish you both all the very good for the future would like to give few more thank before come to some remark to be make before the dissolution of parliament first want to thank my maidenhead constituent who at seven general election over year have elect as their member of parliament have always put great store by the relationship between member of parliament and their constituent and consider my maidenhead constituent to be the good of british they be hard work they be entrepreneurial and they be compassionate in all my year have be strike by the enormous effort that they have put into help other and the voluntary work they do around the constituency have be delighted to represent this magnificent constituency will be the only member of parliament for the constituency because be the first and the boundary be now change so there we be that be my place in history also thank my maidenhead conservative association include all the officer over time and all the activist we all know how those who deliver the leaflet knock on the door and raise the fund be an important part of our democracy and our politic also join the mother of the house in thank the house of commons staff both those who be see and the many who be unseen and unheard thank in particular the police and security staff who keep we safe it be bring home to we on the sad day of the westminster bridge attack when pc keith palmer lose his life that there be those who be willing to put themselves forward to ensure that we can be safe and that this parliament and this part of our democracy can continue would like to thank my staff in my office of whom have have number over the year currently they be cameron bradbury ryan loveridge emma willis and in particular jenny sharkey who have be with for year through all the thick and thin of my time in parliament say huge thank you to they most member of the public do not realise the enormous job that the staff of members of parliament do and the significance of their role but we owe they great debt my final thank before move on to other comment be to somebody think should describe as my good canvasser in chief he be quite good leaflet deliverer as well who have be alongside and support for every one of those year in this place and for my time stand beforehand and as councillor in the london borough of merton who be also there when be prime minister in the evening when he have to make the bean on toast and pour the whisky when the day have not go quite as well as have expect that of course be my husband philip hon member hear hear it will be great wrench to leave this place want to be conservative member of parliament from the age of about be always conservative have never be member of another party have always be conservative in the room and will continue to be conservative in the room be in this place be huge privilege but it also bring with it significant responsibility and want to take serious moment to comment on some of those responsibility our responsibility first of all be to democracy democracy have raise living standard and lead to the betterment of people in so many part of the world but sadly democracy today fear be under threat while it be easy to answer the question what be the great threat to democracy by say well an autocratic state like russia or china actually we should never forget the danger to democracy from within the most recent united nations human development report show that for the first time ever more than half the global population support leader who may undermine democracy there be polling evidence that an increase proportion of young people do not think democracy be the way to run government we in this mother of parliaments should do all that we can to show the value and importance of democracy because it be democracy that enable people to have the freedom to be the good they can be and to do what they want to do rather than what the state tell they they must do so we have real job both politician continue in this house and politician leave to ensure that we do everything we can to maintain democracy sadly we see in in the january attack on the capitol that great bastion of democracy that our democracy be actually more fragile than we have think over the year so urge everybody to champion that cause this place be also important because it enable we to be voice for the voiceless early this week be able as be number of member of the house to attend the funeral of the late frank field he be man who spend his life in this place give voice to the voiceless ensure that truth be tell to power and we should never shy from do that it be important powerful as this place be and powerful as they may feel they be that mps should always recognise there be those who do not have that power mp should be there for everybody and should give that voice to the voiceless there have be work on number of issue across the house to do just that over the year and be pleased to have be able to help in some of that work my final comment about responsibility be about the job of be member of parliament think it be the good job in the world of course it have its frustration it particularly have its frustration when you be in government and people on your own side do not vote for your legislation laughter three time but there we be we get over these thing we carry on and we come back but it be really important job and the key to it be to represent constituent worry have say this elsewhere and will say it here in this chamber that too many people in politic today think that it be about they their ambition their career and not about the people they serve be member of parliament be public service we be here to serve our country and our constituent have enjoy my time although as have indicate it have have its up and down spend year in opposition and say to all member on the conservative benches you do not want to do that go out there and fight to ensure that conservative government be re elect wish all the very good to my successor in the new maidenhead constituency and to all those who return to this chamber after the election ask only that they remember the importance of our democracy that they can be voice for the voiceless and that their job here be not to advance themselves but to serve the people who elect they it be great privilege to be able to speak today as the long serve labour member of parliament make my maiden speech on july and here we be head for july general election have be here darn long time nearly always on the back benches although in the mist of time sit on the front bench for year under various labour leader have have the privilege of do range of job in this house have be think back in order to give advice to harpreet uppal who will be the labour candidate in huddersfield and would be come to this place for the first time be think this morning what advice would give new member and it echo some of the thing say by the former prime minister the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may who have be good friend of mine over the year we can be friend across the political divide she might remember that when she stand down as prime minister say do not just disappear stay on the back benches and she have do because as she have say it be wonderful thing to do be so privileged to be elect in huddersfield have have hard time the first seat fight be taunton against edward du cann and surprisingly do not win although think be the last labour candidate to come second there however when arrive in parliament feel that be represent the classic town can not say the average town of britain be an economist be at the london school of economics with some very difficult people one of whom be sit right in front of here learn to use the tool of the economist to assess the sort of job that be go to do the first thing that do as young member of parliament be to assess as far as could the strength and weakness of my constituency indeed raise some money to get terence conran to come to huddersfield and assess the future of its once vibrant manufacturing industry we know that there would be few manufacturing job that the world be change and that in order to maintain the high quality well pay job that huddersfield have have for year we have to have diverse economy that do other thing one of the great thing that his report say be make sure that you expand that polytechnic into university because that be the future for the skill that this country need have sir john major in my constituency recently give the harold wilson lecture remind he that thank to he and ken clarke another old friend of mine huddersfield transcend from have polytechnic to have university which be absolutely crucial think all member be aware of just how vital university be in the town and city of our country indeed the only partially political thing will say today be that we urgently need to address the threat to the long term stability of the high education sector in our country when chair the select committee on education and skills we produce very good report on the challenge for high education worldwide it become clear that we have to invest in the future of our university and ensure that they have the diverse income stream they need be viable we be at critical point it be now for all party to assess that and do something radical about it because it be so important want to refer also to the role of member of parliament in parliament let we get the message out more as the former prime minister do about what wonderful job this be be well known on these benches as bit of troublemaker the speaker and deputy speakers sometimes have really interesting expression on their face when they be not quite sure what be go to say on particular topic after my year as select committee chair decide that would just do parliament that would be here raise the issue and campaign much of the success that have achieve have come not from just do the party political job the house might not know that as young university teacher be involve in head on crash as be come back from our second daughter baptism when someone on wrong side of the road drive into our family car think at one stage that my wife be dead but she actually be unconscious and we all survive the child myself and my wife when get into this house be determined to make sure that wear seat belt would become the law of the land it have be defeat time but we work together on an all party basis my only successful private member bill be one that ban child from be carry in the front seat of car without restraint ken clarke more or less help with that although think only on the basis that would stop push for mandatory seatbelt it be difficult job as many people know back in the day margaret thatcher be against it and michael foot be against it and the whip would try to stop it happen we have to bounce the legislation out of the house of lords at critical time the night before the royal wedding of charles and diana because of the public holiday lot of people think what lovely weekend we get away on thursday and we will have to come back till tuesday so we hide our all party troop all over the house and when the lords amendment come back down here we manage to get seatbelt wonderful friend of mine in the world health organisation say the nice thing that anyone have ever say about at conference three year ago just before covid barry sherman with his obsessive interest in transport safety have probably save more life worldwide than any other politician on the planet that be rather nice do not believe it but it be nice that it be say there be time where people say that all party group be dangerous or disreputable some of the good thing that have do in this house have be on cross party basis campaign on the environment campaign for educational change and campaign for clean water all the thing that we be passionate about spend my life as social entrepreneur look for people who want to do little conspiracy not barrel of gunpowder in the basement but conspiracy to do something that need do the only criterion use and still use be to attract people with experience knowledge passion and courage we can do that on an all party basis and we have hope more of that will happen in future because it be essential to this house that we identify what need to be do and use those sort of little plot and plan to make thing happen we also need to involve people from outside be look at the chairman of the justice committee the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill when say that because when we start look at miscarriage of justice we find there be whole world of senior king counsel probation worker and other who want to work with we to do something about the real inadequacy of the justice system the hon and learn gentleman and have become friend over the year campaign on number of thing in the justice sector by represent constituency we learn so much about its problem if we be do our job year in and year out we learn about child poverty unemployment and employment we learn what be happen in the economy by look at our constituency we can see what the need will be not just tomorrow and the next day but over the next five or year sometimes get irritable and do not want to criticise too many people who be or have be member of this house but people waft in here and have go at be minister or shadow minister they think have do that and off they go to do something else do not believe that be the right spirit be parliamentarian be sacred trust once person be elect they have sacred trust and responsibility to the people who live in their constituency and they should make they their priority member should not try to become famous or try to find nice little niche somewhere their primary responsibility be to their constituency and its future welfare be sure that harpreet uppal who will very likely replace on july will carry that standard will now say something about the big issue like my fellow member who attend the london school of economics have always seek to know the cause of thing which be the lse motto why be this happen what have change socioeconomically have be in the house when really good thing have happen and when absolutely disastrous thing have happen be totally committed european but have not always be when be very young candidate for council in south wales somebody ask to speak to the local woman labour party because the local labour mp be much too enthusiastic about europe and speak against europe and then grow up see the huge benefit of be link with europe both for our common defence and for the future of our economy my constituency have high level of export in top quality fashion womenswear and menswear and top quality engineering everything top quality in huddersfield depend on the export market and we have have some very severe cutback since we leave the european union huddersfield be like everywhere else two of the kirklees constituency just vote to remain and two constituency just vote to leave the picture be very mixed finish by say that not only should we all be look to our constituency listen to the voice of our constituent and campaigning but we should not get too depressed about life many conservative mp be desperately envious of because be teach at the london school of economics by michael oakeshott who some people regard as one of the great conservative philosopher do not only his history of idea course but his special subject for two year group of eight of we study machiavelli what privilege because be interested in the history of idea use to lecture on the subject and be always absolutely strike by the work of thomas malthus who be the rector at bath he write the theory of population which hold that so many people be breed so quickly that the country would not be able to feed its people suggest that it be the end of the civilised world as lecture on malthus think about the present concern with global warming and climate change which be the existential challenge that we all face want to end on this note be an optimist malthus be wrong because he underestimate how clever human being be we revolutionise agricultural production with the crop rotation system we develop fertiliser we invent not only canal but railway we transport good and people we change the whole basis of the malthusian project today there be the existential challenge of climate change and global warming it be go to happen recently help to launch here come the sun book on this issue by professor steve jones and the fact of the matter be that that challenge be come but we human be clever through our university business and member of parliament we will get the answer so that our planet do not start to fry and life do not end that be my message today it have be privilege and an honour to be here have wonderful staff in yorkshire and wonderful staff here have give hundred of young people the chance to get into politic through all the internship programme that we have have with the lse cornell university and so on thank goodness that have have the chance to be here all these year thank you madam deputy speaker thank you fellow parliamentarian love you all we do not have time for to share all my anecdote about my experience during my year of be member of parliament could tell the house about my trip to iran with jeremy corbyn and jack straw which be like something out of monty python turn out to be the most pro european of the three and it be certainly an extraordinary experience or about the touching and important time when as the security minister join the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge on visit to mosque in her constituency she have campaign against antisemitism for year and year and she have represent the very good of labour position on jewish community and the jewish member of her party for many decade as an mp those kind of thing touch you and go with you in your memory would first like to thank my family the people who make the real sacrifice for we to be in this house be not we they be the wife the husband and the child who put up with bullying separation and all sort of concern in today world of social medium they put up with hate as well without they none of we could be here at all will mention the staff in my office be very privileged that zoe dommett have work for since three week after the day be elect year ago some of we have colleague who seem to get through staff like rotate barrel but luckily zoe alf clempson susan hunt and una frost have work for for many year alf clempson be my sergeant in the army and he be still work for today turn to the staff of the house without the clerks the waitress the maitre and the doorkeepers none of we would be able to our job long after the debate have get interesting they still have to hang around this house when many of we can go home or elsewhere they be absolutely key they do everything for all of we without judgment or party political bias and in my experience they be never anything other than polite and supportive thank they all the way be go to list all my civil servant not all from the ministry of defence have be very privileged in this house to serve in government and to govern thank my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may for give the chance to be her security minister our job be to represent all our constituent but it be to govern on their behalf as well that be true privilege and it be also luck use to see colleague who would think it be their right to govern and that only they be the special people we be choose by whip and prime ministers often at random but we be not special not the one and should never take it personally we may have month or year although let we face it in the past few year in this government it could be week feel incredibly lucky to govern on behalf of my constituent and the constituent of this government alongside the team that be the government that be what it be team never vote against the member hear hear there be the whips luckily the smoking ban legislation never make it or might have be vote against that part of the bill so my unblemished record will remain it be team we should not forget that what allow we to govern be our civil servant hundred of they my private office and my private secretary put in hour and hour unknown unnamed and often blame by some colleague and the medium for thing not go right if it do not go right in government it be because the minister be not govern right be not good minister be not do the extra hour need be not make themselves clear and be not take an interest in how they govern we govern not just by brand declaration and policy minister govern by use process the right people and policy and by communicate those who be good govern across the house as well the house be at its good during discussion about ukraine it be at its good when work with colleague in all party include the then leader of the scottish national party at westminster the right hon member for ross skye and lochaber ian blackford and when could sit down and talk to the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer about secret and threat to our constituent it be at its good when we have prime minister the right hon member for maidenhead who know security and take the hour and day need to read the intelligence and treat it with the severity it need the right hon gentleman be make an outstanding speech thank he for the role he play as defence secretary and the courtesy he show to member across the house include the leader of the opposition the then leader of the liberal democrats and myself he be gracious enough to ensure we be brief on bi weekly basis because there be time when the house must come together over matter of national security what an example the right hon gentleman set and thank he for the role he play during that time hear hear one of the lesson learn when be first elect to the scottish parliament in it be bit like be behind enemy line for conservative there be of we out of be that it be surprise who be nice or helpful remember dennis canavan former member of this house who never quite make it past the tony blair vetting system to be labour member in the scottish parliament and who be hard leave in definition be extremely supportive and kind to as new member of parliament member never know where they might get support and they should be open to it it be amazing how people politic be often separate to their kindness or their need for support for what they want to do we be all in this house to do the good job for our constituent who be the people would like to thank finally my constituent in lancaster and wyre and then in wyre and preston north win seat in and win in opposition remember sit in the cabinet of liz truss and realise be the only member of the cabinet who have be in opposition when stand down last september be the last minister appoint by david cameron who have continue to be minister throughout have serve five prime ministers which think be record although probably self inflict by the conservative party nevertheless to serve five prime ministers as minister uninterrupted be not only an experience but show the time of change we be live in do not think any party be go to be insulate from those type of change our public our discourse our medium and the social medium pressure be change our society and not for the well people be not want to take time in make decision people be try to do thing at rush there be lack of stability in our society there be disinformation there be division there be aggression and fear very much as someone who have study the threat every day for seven and half year both as security minister and defence minister that we be move into period where the world be less stable less secure and more anxious and that be also the case here at home on these beautiful shore it sadden because as young man and indeed as defence secretary often or sometimes would have to inflict violence on behalf of the state to defend other it be no easy thing to do and we should never celebrate it but we have to do it to keep ourselves safe yet always think of the victim or the consequence of those action that we take people do not realise that the sole authority in government for the use of lethal force lie with the secretary of state for defence and that it can be veto by prime minister they be the only two who in the end make decision that often affect people life and death and that send people into harm way on behalf of the state that be very important responsibility and know that whoever from whichever party do that job next will be well support by the man and woman of the armed force and the civil servant and the security service who absolutely put sacrifice and duty first and should be an inspiration to we all at sandhurst be teach the motto serve to lead that the way we lead people whether our troop or the public be to give up ourselves to sacrifice ourselves for their service and that mean sacrifice our ego and sometimes our ambition and sadly sometimes cost our private life as well ultimately if we in this house do not realise that duty and service be how we serve this country do not know who else will we must maintain those standard and maintain that principle for eternity because as my right hon friend the member for maidenhead say across the world people be not believe in democracy or the rule of law and people look to britain when go around the world as defence secretary or prime minister or foreign secretary or represent the opposition we learn that people look to britain still for tolerance for democracy for the rule of law we must recognise that that be part of our dna and our core be sad that we will have another general election although of course that be the nature of this wonderful democracy it will be my sixth general election but will not be fight it and know that across this house many of our colleague of different party will lose their seat through no fault of their own they will have do everything in their time here they will have serve their constituent sacrifice family time they will have do their very good they will have try to answer the email from the impossible constituent they will have put up with threat and they will lose their seat because on polling day someone will decide they do not like their prime minister or their leader and that be the way of thing people should not take it personally and say to colleague present who may not return to this house that in my experience if the boundary do get you the electorate one day will do take it personally you be love by all of we and you will remain so so madam deputy speaker thank you thank you to this house which use to dream about join when be young boy at school politic be the only level actually enjoy be inspire by teacher get in it be afraid to say my child laugh at that whenever tell they nevertheless politic be about people and when we forget that we be in trouble and the bad for it the final thing would say as an election be approach we be almost already in it be that always try to make sure that defence be core part of government not discretionary spend stick on the end we hear in all part of the house line such as defence do not win election well it can lose they live in the north west of england and be not try to be party political but loyal patriotic labour voter reject the labour party in because they feel that the leader at that time do not care about defence and about they defence matter it be not an add on after health and education when we come to write our manifesto let we please include investment in defence let we ensure that it be core and let we not allow leader to say thing like when economic condition allow we do not say that about health and we do not say it about education have read so much intelligence for so many year be frightened to think that by the end of this decade if our armed force and our security service be not match fit for the threat that be come our way we will have only ourselves to blame it be our child who might have to go and fight for we and they deserve to be as protect as possible with the good equipment and the good ally rise order before hand over the chair to nigel evans hope the house will forgive if indulge myself slightly by take this last opportunity to thank everyone for the kind remark that have be make over the past day or so about my step down be deeply touch by what mr speaker say this morning and thank he for all the support he have give over the year as well as my fellow deputy speakers it have mean so much we have have some difficult time in this parliament and mr speaker leadership and that of his team have essentially get we through it despite those pressure however we have manage to have quite lot of fun and laugh and it have be great team to be part of it have be privilege to be in this chair and to witness at first hand the work that member of this house do on behalf of their constituent and on behalf of the country yes it can get bit argumentative and yes it can get rather passionate sometimes as witness recently myself but that be the price of our democracy and as other have say we be lucky to have it be proud to have be able as deputy speaker to play part in that also want to thank once again all the staff of the house for as other have say make the house work so effectively thank the excellent clerk for their wise and calm advice and of course thank the utterly magnificent doorkeepers who look after we all so well this really be water in my glass by the way it be not gin and tonic as someone suggest to yesterday like other have be extremely lucky to have have brilliant team in my constituency office and excellent adviser here in parliament have also be very lucky with my local labour party whose member have work so hard and so diligently over the year wish all right hon and hon member well for the future whether or not they be stand for election again finally want to thank the people of doncaster have be honour to serve as their representative in parliament for wonderful year let start by thank you madam deputy speaker you have be the fair most tolerant most patient and most wonderful deputy speaker as indeed have the other and think we should all thank you for the calm and discipline manner in which you have conduct what have sometimes be very difficult debate also acknowledge the right hon member for wyre and preston north mr wallace for be incredibly kind to all hon member when he be security minister and we face challenge be always astound by the amount of time that he be willing to spend with we individually to support we through those difficult time

that be go to stutter but get through it my husband and four child be here watch do the usual thing of sit down and listen to couple of speech then we all go to have cup of tea and some scone come back for the wind up and sit up in the corner suddenly hear the mighty voice of betty boothroyd admonish for have sit in the wrong place because do not have clue that the protocol of the house mean that we have to sit where we have give our speech when we come back for the wind up feel really tell off but realise that that be the role of the speaker another early experience that must share with the house reflect the challenge that many hon member face in balance our responsibility as member of the house and our role as parent and carer at home it happen early in my career when tony blair have just be elect as leader of the labour party know that if sit behind he at prime minister question the good burgher of barking would think that be really work hard to do that have to bag my place about half an hour before it start so sit down feel pleased with myself and wait for it to start in those day this be so long ago we do not have phone but pager and as pmq start and tony make his first contribution my pager suddenly go off it be my year old daughter say mum ring home emergency she be suppose to be revise for her gcse so think goodness have the house catch fire be she go to tell she pregnant have no idea what it be give up the seat rush outside pick up the phone and say what be it anna what happen she say oh nothing mum just want to see whether you have your pager on silent that may be enough of the funny reflection but perhaps will mention one more the time that my dental bridge fall out as be give an impassioned speech on transparency in british tax haven suddenly think what on earth happen be rescue by my true friend my hon friend the member for oxford east anneliese dodds to whom will always be indebted she immediately intervene which mean that could sit down and sort my mouth out before get up to continue my contribution as other hon member have want to thank everybody thank all the staff in westminster who make our life easy safe and more effective it be only now that be about to leave this place that realise how well we have all be look after by everybody here from those who keep our room tidy and clean to those who provide endless food and drink keep we safe support we in committees and the chamber make sure that we stick by the rule and record the word that we speak we have the most brilliant team of people who put up with lot on whom we be all very dependent and to whom express my heartfelt gratitude and thank thank too all the staff who have serve have not manage to hang on to anybody for year but have have endlessly wonderful staff support both here in westminster and in the constituency and of course thank all my constituent in barking whom love deeply and the party that have support down the year also want to thank the very many member of this house both in my party and across the chamber from all the political tribe who have show friendship down the year and display willingness to work together across the house to achieve change that we all believe will make britian well country so often politic be portray as poison polarised personal and painful and sometimes it be but the good work we do in this chamber in select committees and through all party parliamentary group happen when we come together and find consensus and when shared ambition and approach bring we to collective solution that we can all support when we work together we achieve much more lasting change that really will make the world well place as leave this position would like to share one reflection with the house we be live through period of increase and increase mistrust of politic and politician when first become an mp be always really proud to tell people meet that be an mp for it be not job but vocation be sure that many of we in the chamber share that feeling like most people who seek election just want to play my little part in make the world well place and in equalise life chance in every community but thing have change in the last few year do not know whether other feel the same but now often feel that have to apologise to people for be an mp we be too often distrust as group and our effort be ridicule and mock it be not that people be apathetic about politic it be that they be angry about politic they feel that we do not listen that we exist in our own bubble here in westminster that we be in it just for ourselves that we put party before country and that we put self interest before our constituent interest that may not be true but that be what people feel we all know here that politic really do matter it matter lot it matter in every family and every community know that we all know that from my very first campaign as an mp to change the rule govern the prescribing of particular painkiller whose side effect have life change impact on constituent to the recent campaigning have do for smart regulation to turn the tide on dirty money politics matter what we decide here can make difference my fear be that the anger that people feel will turn to apathy and people will not use their democratic right to vote in the general election low turnout could well be the main headline from this come election of course we need to clean up politic and stop the abuse that have become too commonplace in too many way from ministers not abide by the nolan principle to money too often dirty money buy access peerage honour and contract we must also go back to our basic the basic of listen to our constituent respond to their need and not ours and reflect their priority in the work that we do here hope that the next group of members of parliament when they be elect on july will take all that really seriously and see rebuild trust in politic and democracy as prime objective that they have to meet during the next parliament leave be bittersweet have already sign up to piano lesson and be hop to spend bit more time with my too many grandchild who have not see enough of but also know that this have be the privilege of my life be member of parliament meet and mix with so many talented generous warm committed and principled people have be pleasure joy and privilege will miss it like mad but wish everybody really well thank you margaret we will miss you like mad too we love you be not expect to speak today as do not know there be slot today for valedictory speech during yesterday statement speak about the importance of the nhs and say that that would be the end of my contribution but see mr speaker last night and he explain that some time would be give over to valedictory speech today have have the conservative whip restore this week be delighted to say that many many colleague have say you should say something and reflect start by say what an honour it be to follow the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge who teach an enormous amount when be new member of parliament and serve on her public accounts committee it be our public accounts committee in theory but as she be chair it be very much her pac undertake to read every word of every draft report because she be brilliant at occasionally interruption she be laugh which take as an admission of guilt she know what be go to say she would occasionally stick in sentence that put the boot into the government but she would put it on about page hop that nobody else in the committee would notice take it upon myself to read the detail and learn that from she have of course find serve in this house to be the privilege of my life be sure we all feel that agree strongly with the word of the former prime minister my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may and the former defence secretary my right hon friend the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace about the importance and value of public service politic no matter how difficult it can be be public service because in democracy it be the only way to translate the will of the people into the governance of the nation we be the channel through which that should happen and want to thank some people who have help make it happen for want to thank the people who get into politic in the first place particularly dr michael hart who be also the man who spot my dyslexia and nick st aubyn the man who suffer most from my dyslexia be his agent in the general election when he be the member for guildford let retell terrible story he have write his election address and have put it into very early version of powerpoint he have write this lovely phrase want to unite the community think it be great so put it into the headline it be only when copy of the election address have be deliver that he pick copy up from his doormat and say matt why have your write want to untie the community he take it very well but unfortunately he lose the seat and do not speak about my dyslexia for year after that because of the shame it bring he also forgave which be truly heroic act thank my staff here particularly helen dudley who retire few year ago and elizabeth hitchcock thank the countless other who have support in my office here in parliament but those two have always hold the thing together especially in time in government when it be hard to give as much time as one would want to one constituency duty they really have take action both of they be prefer to in west suffolk and do much well job than could have do thank all the civil servant with whom serve and work so closely but also want to put in word for special adviser let give one short story about why special adviser be such valuable and important part of our political system in the pandemic member might remember that during the vaccination programme there be an interval gap between two dos of the vaccine be give can not remember how long it be it might have be week one of my political special adviser spot tweet from an american statistician say that because the first vaccine have much great impact than the second if we reduce the number of week between the first and the second be give we would save many life he spot the tweet and bring it to take it to the clinical lead professor whitty and professor van tam who run the math and verify it we speak to the regulator and despite this be novel within nine day the information spot in tweet by an american statistician become government policy announce here and that be follow throughout the world that alone be calculate to have save life in the uk there be many more staff would like to thank include my three agent in west suffolk over the year dorothy whittaker lance stanbury and bobby bennett and like the former defence secretary also thank my family in particular my child because the impact of the scrutiny of politic especially when people make mistake have huge impact on they and they have put up with lot it be in the nature of politic that people do not see what team effort it be many people have say that today what will miss most the single unambiguous answer to that question be that will miss colleague the most in difficult time the support of colleague both on this and the other side of the house have be incredibly powerful will also miss the opportunity to contribute to national debate the single vote that regret not have take part in be that on assist dying which surely will come and which have come to support very passionately politic be also noisy and hard than it be year ago when first come to parliament the nature of social medium have make it more difficult and the nature of the world have sadly make it more dangerous even through this one of the thing that have try to promote be the power of technology as force for good the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman and have campaign on that together over the year yes we must ensure that technology be harness for the benefit of humanity but by god we must make sure that harness it we do we can not stand in the way and the uk be at its good when we be at the forefront and when we harness the power of modern technology my prediction be that over the next year the impact will be far great not just on the economy but on society and politic than it have be even over the past year we be live through the slow rate of change of our life it be only go to get fast and hope that this place be ready for that can not finish without word on the nhs and the role it play in our national life when my right hon friend the member for maidenhead ask to be health secretary she say we need to improve the tech in the health service could you do that for month thoroughly enjoy myself try to improve the tech in the health service then of course the pandemic strike for one last time want to say thank you to all of those who rise to the occasion and do so much to get we through deliver the necessary safety measure include the shielding programme which be not mention as much as it should be protect those who be most vulnerable and of course the vaccine programme be without doubt one of the country fine achievement in peacetime want to thank the colleague with whom work incredibly closely and who help make that happen some of they be hero of the pandemic too leave by say this think it be impossible for political party those aspire to govern to win without some of those lodestar it be impossible and wrong to win without be on the side of the future and try to represent the youth of our country who be come through they may see thing differently from how we do say that even as year old it be impossible to win or to deserve to win without true love of the nhs be proud to serve prime minister who be from an nhs family that true love be important because the people believe it and it be true finally it be impossible to win unless we truly want to serve our country believe that everybody come into this place want to make their country well place have try my hard to do that for year to reach out to try to do thing differently and to try to embrace the future it have be honour and privilege and thank you thank you matt and thank you nhs it be real privilege to speak in this debate and listen to all the reflective speech from right hon and hon member right across the house it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for west suffolk matt hancock do not know whether he recall the engagement we use to have when he be at the department for culture media and sport actually regret that he move on to the health portfolio because at the time we have have an important meeting about support for gaelic broadcasting he be generous in recognise the strength of the argument that have put about increase that support what happen he leave and the moment be go can not help reflect on my engagement with another government minister the right hon member for surrey heath michael gove when he be the secretary of state responsible for agriculture we be have some debate about support for scottish agriculture it be typical feisty scottish debate there be lot of passion and perhaps some surprise among the official in the room but it end up with the right hon gentleman ask to come with he to the treasury to make the case think hang on you the government minister you suppose to be do this but be glad to say that in that case we be successful in get the convergence uplift money to scottish crofter and farmer that be good indication of when this house be at its good when members of parliament across the house can come together and we can achieve decision for the benefit of our constituent it be an honour and privilege for every member to serve in this house but for there be something particular about represent remote and rural constituency the large in the united kingdom at square kilometre it be the same size as northern ireland engage with constituent be so important my one regret about the election come this early be that have have to postpone my summer surgery tour those who know the west highland can see smile around the chamber will be aware that that be three week tour visit many island different place to hold constituency surgery spend yesterday unravel all my plan for that and wish my successor every success my last constituency engagement be on tuesday when be up in the isle of skye celebrate year of the gaelic college in the presence of the duke of edinburgh be glad to say that the college continue to flourish but we all have the important role of represent our constituent many other right hon and hon member have talk about the importance of come here to serve we all do that because we believe in public service we all believe that we be here to try to make our constituent live well but of course we come from different political persuasion in my and my party case although we respect this place and the job we be here to do our aim be as winnie ewing famously say not to settle down but to settle up and make sure that we advance the cause of scottish independence when we come out of this chamber and pass through those door we leave the argument behind because in the end we be all here to do the same job of represent our constituent member on the opposite benches be not our enemy they be our colleague we should remember the importance of have respectful debate and dialogue like other member regret the polarisation we see in society and the toxicity of our social medium each and every one of we include those in the medium have responsibility to ensure that we show appropriate leadership and get to well place as be say early young people need to feel encouraged to come into parliament and politic and must not be put off be sad to say that many people today will question whether they want to serve be elect to the house in make my maiden speech on may it be one of my short speech at only minute though will not attempt to detain the house too long this afternoon quote donald stewart the first snp member of parliament to be elect at general election who say if stray into controversial matter they will in sense be impartial controversy since as nationalist member shall be in controversy with both side of the house from time to time for that reason if stray hope that it will be less objectionable to the tradition of the house official report december vol can remember give my maiden speech and have to say that when the snp mps arrive we be make to feel very welcome by many colleague across the house not least by the hon member for brigg and goole andrew percy who see be in his place up at the back have give my maiden speech on the second day and with the snp have to respond early to every debate we find very quickly that we be be ask to speak on subject know little about will not say what the subject be but take some advice from the hon member for brigg and goole when ask he andrew what be suppose to do he say ian it be easy just attack we that be the good advice be give and hope have be true to it over the last nine year but in constructive manner the right hon and learn member for camberwell and peckham ms harman who be no long in her place speak about never have vote against the whip advice early in the parliament the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas move ten minute rule bill and my hon friend the member for perth and north perthshire pete wishart say to go into the aye lobby and offer to tell for the hon lady go through the lobby only to find out that the whip advice have change and we be abstain so become the first snp mp to rebel in that parliament do keep it up and suppose be give the whip advice for most of the period after that let come back to when snp mp and only one conservative mp one labour mp and one liberal democrat mp be elect in scotland it be almost complete whitewash that come several month after the scottish independence referendum in it be worth gently and politely remind the house that we have just have the smith commission and be tell at that point that scotland be to lead the uk and that it be partnership of equal have to say with regret that that have not often prove to be case over the last few year with respect to the result of the referendum it be our right to continue to put the case for scotland to be an independent country in election to westminster and to the scottish parliament say to the house that that constitutional question have yet to be resolve there be fundamental question give that this be union of equal as to how scotland be permit to leave that union if it choose to do so make that point because in the election to the scottish parliament in there be majority of independence supportive member what mechanism be there this will have to be address at some point if the people of scotland show through the election of member of parliament here or elsewhere that they have desire to achieve different solution accept that for the snp and those who believe in independence we will win that argument only if we can win the economic argument by show that scotland can should and will be prosperous country we hear early from the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman about everything that be happen with green energy we be face today by many challenge but my goodness what an opportunity we have with the potential for wind solar and tidal that will become an opportunity for we only if we can command the supply chain and drive the investment we need into that industry of course that desire to achieve economic growth ought to be for purpose and that purpose be ensure that we can improve our public service say to conservative members respectfully that when we have that debate about the future whether it be here or in scotland we need to have that engagement with everybody let quickly reflect on economic growth it would be my contention that ever since the financial crisis in we have struggle to create the circumstance of sustainable economic growth indeed this morning be look at statistic show that growth in the us economy since the pandemic have be but relative growth for the united kingdom over the same period have be now we can discuss budgets financial statement and all the rest of it as we do but we need to have that debate about the fundamental how do we up our game how do we drive up investment how do we drive up productivity all the pressure that we have along with the talk about tax cut and the talk about investment in our public service will be address only when we consider the fundamental of how we deliver sustainable economic growth in this country we have if may say so the disastrous premiership of the previous prime minister which expose weakness in our mortgage market from we not have long term fix mortgage for example we can talk about the fact that yes there be some encouraging sign with the economy but when it come down to real people we know that million household have be expose to rise mortgage rate since the beginning of analysis by the bank of england show that give where we be now and even with hope the prospect of some reduction in interest rate over the come period another million household will still be expose to rise interest rate over the come period we can stop and think about what that mean it mean that on average people be pay more for their mortgage than they be prior to the rise in interest rate if may let quickly reflect on what have happen over the course of the past nine year and my goodness the pace of change with brexit covid and of course the situation with ukraine and now gaza as well accept that across the united kingdom people vote for brexit in scotland we do not we wish to remain in the european union the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may talk about the three vote that she lose in this house if have one regret from all of that period it be that as think back to the to parliament or indeed the to parliament would contend that in this house there be majority for stay in the single market and the custom union it be pity that we do not come together across the house yes we could have allow the brexit that people in the united kingdom vote for that do not mean that we have to come out of the single market and the custom union regret the economic self harm that we have have as consequence be glad about the progress that have be make this week on infected blood and on horizon my one regret be that we have not yet successfully deal with the waspi woman know that will fall to the new government but hope that on cross party and consensual basis we can recognise accept and deliver justice as we must for the waspi woman who face an increase in woman pensionable age that simply be not communicate in the right manner see the minister for disabled people health and work on the front bench say respectfully that she will know that the other issue want to see resolve be footballer with dementia we think about the suffering that they and their family be go through this need to be classify as an industrial injury and hope that in the next parliament there be some closure on that issue will begin to wind up mr deputy speaker for much of my time in this house have have the privilege of be not just the mp for ross skye and lochaber but the snp westminster leader be grateful for the opportunity that be give by colleague and have to say for the relationship that have across the house in that period have talk about the right hon member for wyre and preston north mr wallace and his engagement with other which be an example of the co operation that need to happen when we face the situation that we do indeed we reiterate today that all of we will stand by our friend in ukraine we must see russia push back and see liberty freedom and security deliver to those people do regret that the house have not be able to come together to the same extent over gaza because we be all watch the humanitarian crisis that be take place there hope that we can show leadership on that issue agree on the need to bring peace and security to the region and recognise the importance of deliver two state solution so that both community can live together and the responsibility on this house to show leadership to make sure we can get to that point finally let thank the staff in the house of commons who work day in day out to make we feel welcome and to support we the security staff the doorkeepers and the catering staff and also the speaker and the deputy speakers for the role they play and the courtesy they have always show want to thank my constituency staff and the leadership staff that have at westminster the job that we all have as politician we only do because of the ability of those who tirelessly work in support of we all leave this house be bittersweet moment for all of we who be depart thank everyone for their co operation and for the argument that we have sometimes have as well we should remember that all of we come here to serve what privilege it be for each and every one of we thank all the voter of ross skye and lochaber it have be the privilege of my life finally first come to this place in come with my partner who be sit in the under gallery so there be sense of closure have come here all those decade ago today we will be leave thank you for the opportunity to serve thank you ian and good luck to you both as be watch this debate sit in this beautiful chamber be think of my constituency of harlow not so long ago be campaign outside lidl supermarket which do regularly hand out leaflet one time this be genuinely true story lady come up to and say that my leaflet have come through her letterbox that very morning she say how handsome look but follow that up by say you look bloody awful in real life tell that story not just because it be true but because however wonderful this place be and however incredible it be to be an mp our constituent especially in place like harlow bring we back down to earth with bump that be very good for we because we go back to our constituency and do our community day every friday and saturday and often on sundays and our constituent tell we what be go on almost every saturday go to wonderful sandwich café serve incredible coffee in the centre of the town and my goodness the constituent in that café tell what be what they tell what be really go on whether it be someone whose child can not get special educational need support or somebody who can not get house or whatever it may be be drive through harlow one day and to my shock suddenly see my right hon friend sit by the dual carriageway under bloody great big sign read vote halfon you could not miss he and think my god there someone who know how to campaign thank my right hon friend my truly honourable friend for his intervention it be true it be go to be strange election have do six from onwards include in when lose by vote and at every single election have stand by the roadside with massive sign usually please cut fuel duty from be to am or from pm to pm wave at all the car one time there be van that use to pass every day and they use to scream obscenity at they even bring an inflatable up yours sign to wave at and few day before polling day they throw mild water bomb at just balloon it be fine on the last day on polling day with this have go on for almost six week they get out of the van be think oh my goodness what be they go to do to they slap on the back and say good on you mate we vote conservative as have say parliament be an incredible place an essex mp come to my school although be bring up in north london and say that the houses of parliament have over room demand to go and see those room have to see every single one of they and come here on tour but sadly do not see all room to this very day still have not see all room but decide on that day at year old that would be member of parliament because think this parliament be so beautiful think central lobby be so incredible love history and every single one of we in parliament be part of live history want to be in parliament for another reason although very rarely talk about it because do not want to be know as disabled mp when be child could not walk use to walk on tiptoe perhaps should have go into ballet at covent garden and be tell that would never be able to walk be tell that should go to special school the doctor write to my father say so and remember see the letter even at young age then my father find this incredible professor at great ormond street hospital who understand what be go on and have operation throughout my childhood right through to adult life what be be an mp about it be about give public service look after your constituent and serve the public professor lloyd roberts at great ormond street hospital the person who start it off be the man who change my life and feel that be an mp be my chance to help change other people live for the well should say that be in another hospital and then move to nursing home and none other than nadine dorries the former mp for mid bedfordshire be nurse while be in that hospital so she tell and think sort of remember it she be perhaps the only mp who have see in my birthday suit less the plot more the pot as it might be as an mp you do thing for your constituency and you also champion cause and as my right hon friend the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace say you sometimes have chance to govern when come in want to do three thing the first be to build an even well harlow and the second be to champion the cost of living we think lot about the cost of live now but the cost of live in constituency such as mine have always be tough have constituent where often one partner work in the day and the other work in the evening and people say to we work for hour and still find it hard to keep our head above water start the fuel duty campaign because my local mcdonald have start charge for parking if people stay beyond certain time ask the franchise owner why he be do this and he say people be park overnight because they can afford to drive back home people be park overnight and sleep in their car because they could not afford the cost of fuel which realise be the central issue it be also why as conservative campaign for the living wage be proud to attend cabinet when george osborne the then chancellor announce it be also proud to be george osborne parliamentary private secretary pps be usually know as bag carrier but because of my leg the chancellor sometimes help to carry my briefcase so think be the first pps in history whose bag be carry by the secretary of state rather than the other way around the other most important issue to have be championing apprenticeship and skill way back in when be parliamentary candidate go into building in my constituency and meet some young kid who be be look after by the prince trust which be an amazing organisation that love with every fibre of my body and they talk about apprenticeship and about want to do skill but there be no offering for they these kid be from very disadvantaged background and say to myself on that day that if be elect to parliament would champion apprenticeship and skill my first speech in the house of commons be about try to get more school to encourage their child pupil and student to do apprenticeship as well as go to university by transform career advice in our school so that people understand the apprenticeship offering be very proud of what this government have do we often talk about success in education and reading but be very proud of what this government have do on skill believe that history will show huge apprenticeship reform people can now do an apprenticeship in everything from aeronautic to zoology degree apprenticeship be introduce by my right hon friend the member for west suffolk matt hancock and there have now be more than degree apprentice people can take one in every subject and they be now regard with prestige our level be prestigious vocational qualification we have more than institute of technology teach prestigious tertiary education love harlow college which have visit more than time since become member of parliament because the college the staff and student have teach everything know they help along the way when be championing apprentice be twice the minister for skills apprenticeships and latterly higher education for which be hugely grateful to the prime minister it be huge moment for because select committee chairs and back benchers can campaign and get apprenticeship for prisoner and more career advice for student in school through but ministers can make policy it be an incredible honour to be able to do that and some of our reform over the past couple of year such as the lifelong learning entitlement which will revolutionise adult learning the improved apprenticeship levy and the billion be spend on apprenticeship by will make huge difference we stand up and get the credit for all these thing but could not have do one thing without without will my right hon friend give way will in second could not have do one thing without the incredible staff here they be the people who work for long hour they look after we they be loyal they do the hard work they do the research and they help to prepare the speech want to name few who have be with over the year some have go but hope the house will forgive if name they all because these people really have be incredible they be ann russell day paul abbott victoria thornton janet ballard and melanie torino watch from above in the gallery today maria bellissimo hannah ellis holly papworth ethan harries watch from above natalie dilworth anna taylor watch from above alex griffiths simon carter who start off as my agent dan swords leader of harlow council the young ever leader of any council in political history and former apprentice in my office emily burditt clive russell day aaron farrell and howard cox of fairfueluk there be also of course my wife vanda who be watch and who have stand with through thick and thin will take an intervention now only if you need it always love intervention from my hon friend must also thank the wonderful resident of harlow they be tough they want their member of parliament to work hard to champion and fight for harlow and they expect the good from their mp have work hard to help regenerate our town and some wonderful thing have be happen want to give particular thank to the editor of our local newspaper michael casey who be very special individual we use to have three newspaper in our town which be free and go to every home this man set up an internet newspaper that now receive literally million of hit he give hard time which be his right but if it be not for he we would have no news in harlow do not need to suck up to you any more mr deputy speaker because be not stand again but you have be wonderful person to as have all the other deputy speakers be huge fan of mr speaker as well and hope he remain in place for many year to come he have show nothing but kindness especially want to thank the doorkeepers one of whom be sit in the chamber hope he will not mind my mention he but he know when be researcher every single one of the doorkeepers be extraordinary and decent and be enormously grateful to they all should also mention the staff of the tea room love the tea room call it the lorry driver caff for mps its staff have help every single day and love every one of they let end with just three ask first as will not be here any more to make nuisance of myself on fuel duty ask now that whichever party be in government in the future we continue freeze fuel duty and to cut it let we remember that the prime minister cut it by when he be chancellor secondly ask that we continue as house to champion apprenticeship and skill be the first mp to employ full time parliamentary apprentice in my office and hope that one day the speaker will set up scheme additional to the intern scheme to put more apprentice in mps office and not just in the civil service of the house however brilliant that be as have say never talk much about my leg but be go now and be very lucky to have benefit from for instance the kind officer and doorkeepers in the world as well as the segway have run over few member toe with it from those of my hon friend the member for lichfield michael fabricant to those of former mp for milton keynes and few other in between everyone have be very kind it will not be the same not to be scoot through here and ask everyone to put their leg up especially the lady however this be terrible place for people who have difficulty the lavatory be never work the lift be never work and the door be always shut there be just not enough understanding it be not about produce press release say we an inclusive and diverse employer that mean nothing have have great chat in the last few day with brilliant house of commons staff as have say every single

the year which macmillan epitomise and which inspire many of my generation the seat have change over the year but it be still wonderful part of london to live in as do and intend to continue to do it have be split up by the boundary commission among other thing that have trigger my decision to leave as well as perhaps the passing of the year although not really wish both charlie davis in

in parliament to chair the justice committee the law have be central to my life and always will be deal with those issue in this house and remind people that function justice system be as important social service as function education health and care system matter my brand of conservatism and indeed all safe form of constitutional government depend upon respect for institution check and balance and the independence of our judiciary gently say that anyone in politic who have attempt to attack lawyer for do their job or judge for come to their independent decision be not understanding of check and balance that be neither constitutional nor say gently very conservative hope that have do my good to make that case and that there will be other way in which can continue do so from outside this house thank all member of the committee we have have magnificent team over the year when start two bright young back benchers come on to the committee one be now the attorney general the other be the lord chancellor rather feel that have become sort of legal political banquo not king but father of king it be great source of pride to to see that serious lawyer be still prepared to come into parliament and carry out essential public service frankly we need more of they because to scrutinise legislation forensic mind and approach be of genuine value also thank the committee clerks they have be absolutely brilliant we have have number of they most recently rob cope and his team and david weir who many hon member know before he thank everybody who have work with in that role like to think that we have be consensual and deal with thing on cross party basis and hope that we have make difference in number of area my only regret in my farewell be bring forward somewhat unexpectedly be that there be still business undo that would like to have return to such as the service and work of the probate registry the situation in our prison and the pressure in our court there be still much more to do the people who work in the justice system at every level provide great service to our country have also have the chance to pursue other cause dear to my heart and hope to be able to continue that too be chair of the all party parliamentary group on gibraltar which be matter of great pride to gibraltar be proud part of the british family and we owe it to gibraltarians to have good deal with the european union in order to enable the free flow border that be absolutely essential to gibraltar wellbee it be our choice although not my personal choice to leave the european union that be the democratic decision but as many people will know it place gibraltar under particular pressure we owe it to they not to obstruct any sensible deal be sure that that will be the case in the hand of this or any future government because we have build cross party consensus on support gibraltar have also be able to do that sometimes very dangerous thing in politic of own up to an interest in the art be chair of the all party parliamentary group on opera and be delighted to have work across party with the mother of the house the right hon and learn member for camberwell and peckham ms harman

would you believe never see any contradiction in go to sadler wells or covent garden up in the god on friday and go to upton park to watch west ham on saturday it ought to be perfectly possible to enjoy both and hope that we have future generation of politician just as willing to talk about their interest in theatre music and all other art form as they be about sporting activity they be all part of what enrich our soul finally the other thing that have deal with be stroke care very much hope to continue with that as it be very personal to as the house will know for ann louise sake and

on the opposition benches wait to make my maiden speech all colleague will know what fraught moment that be it be bit like stand for the first time on the high diving board you be hop to make bit of splash but not so much that you damage yourself in the process now at the end of those year be finally bid farewell to this wonderful old place it be my ambition to come here from the age of nine when visit this place with my father fall in love with the palace of westminster and decide that want to become conservative mp you mr deputy speaker will know how remarkable that is because of course be welsh but be also londoner be in fact bear in the london hospital which be within earshot of the bow bell that make the rare of beast be welsh cockney my entire life have be live in two place here in our capital city and in north wales love they both it have be the great privilege of my life to represent the interest of the people of clwyd west in this house in five successive parliaments want they to know that they have my deep thank for the confidence that they have place in over the last year my association with clwyd west begin in when enter article with the firm of william jones and talog davies st peter square ruthin for those who do not know it ruthin be arguably the fine small town in wales its medieval centre be an outstanding collection of building include nantclwyd dre house which be reputedly the only edifice leave stand after glyndŵr put the town to the torch in at the start of his rebellion almost opposite nantclwyd be sir john trevor house which take its name from former speaker of this house john trevor be in fact simultaneously speaker of the commons and master of the rolls at the end of the century he be impeach for take bribe and be banish from the chair of the commons but remarkably enough he be allow to remain master of the rolls which just go to show that in those day high standard be expect of politician than of judge sir john trevor be notorious for his very pronounce squint which as speaker of the commons be something of an occupational hazard because people never know when they have catch his eye several hon member would stand up at the same time and trevor use to get terribly upset about it over recent year ruthin have experience many of the same difficulty as other small market town up and down the country so it be an unequivocal boon when it be award almost million under the levelling up scheme the award will benefit not only the historical town centre but the nearby village of bryneglwys and gwyddelwern which will have new community centre the award also mean that we will have new much need visitor centre on moel famau which be the great hill that overlook ruthin the award will help restore civic pride and it will of course also act as boost to the visitor economy most importantly include to personally it will result in the removal of the ugly intrusive roundabout that have be carbuncle on the otherwise virtually perfect st peter square since the be pleased to work closely with denbighshire county council under the leadership of my friend the excellent councillor hugh evans in produce the levelling up bid and be delighted when it be grant town such as ruthin and many other in north wales have in many respect be forget about over recent year the levelling up fund be develop to address the need of such place and very much hope that other north wales town such as colwyn bay and abergele in my constituency will also benefit from it in future over my year in this house have try my utmost to advance the interest of north wales the levelling up fund be great initiative but much more need to be do in particular transport link need to be improve pleasingly the government have allocate billion to the electrification of the north wales coast main line that be indeed welcome but we need more flesh on the bone my plea be that whoever be in government next should press ahead with that project to ensure that north wales have the sort of rail infrastructure necessary in century economy have be privileged in my time in this house to serve twice in government my first ministerial role be at the wales office where be ultimately appoint secretary of state in that capacity of course have many dealing with the welsh government many of they be positive but my experience be that there be an unfortunate and undesirable tension between the two administrations who be responsible for the governance of wales too frequently that relationship be perceive as competition that be probably the result of an inherent fault in the structure of devolution believe that it need re examine so that both of wales government work in co operation whichever party be in power for the benefit of welsh resident therefore recommend that the next government conduct review of the constitutional settlement with the aim of replace the current state of affair with something that be more beneficial to welsh citizen such settlement would require recognition that some thing be do well here at westminster some at cardiff and some at the local government level indeed welsh local authority should be trust more in the administration of their area if they be there would possibly not have be the problem that we have see as result of the unpopular decision to impose mph speed limit across all build up area in wales my second ministerial position be at the department for exit the european union and be very pleased to see my former colleague my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker in the chamber today that be the most challenging and in many respect the most satisfying experience of my time here at westminster always feel that the united kingdom be an individualistic country and that it be very different from the continental nation and therefore not really fit to be part of supranational organisation such as the eu campaign actively for brexit and be delighted when the british people vote in favour of it the proud moment of my time here at westminster be when take the european union notification of withdrawal act through this house which trigger the legal process of withdrawal we have of course now complete that process we be once again sovereign independent nation although retain concern about northern ireland under the windsor framework also recognise that brexit have be controversial and that some division have be cause by it nevertheless believe that brexit be ultimately the right thing to do and in the interest of the country anyone who spend any time at all as member of this house be hugely privileged we be supremely well serve by erudite and brilliant clerks both in this chamber and in committees we have the benefit of one of the fine research library in the world we have the service of the immaculate doorkeepers we be feed and water by excellent catering staff we be keep secure by brave police officer one of whom keith palmer give his life for we he be quite rightly though sadly posthumously award the george medal and we all have our team of bright highly motivated talented and sometimes very young people all of whom will probably go very far in life want to mention my team of ted wilson greg wynne leanne kennedy isobel barrett and isabel turnbull who be know in the office as the two izzys we be highly blessed in this extraordinary community and thank each and every member of it finally thank the staff of hansard who record our every utterance no matter how profound or banal with absolute accuracy for the benefit and probably the bemusement of future generation indeed such be their accuracy that have no doubt that they will faithfully transcribe the name of some of the lovely village of my constituency

his great triumph it be also great privilege to follow my great friend my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill although there be one moment when think be not his friend when have the honour to be parliamentary private secretary to eric pickles he say to one morning will you come in on friday stephen there meeting want you to attend it be particularly tricky negotiation with the fire brigades union bob open the meeting he then say have bring along the pps to the secretary of state today stephen what would the secretary of state like to say at which point be completely blindside bit like with much of his cross examination realise that as stand here today it be year and five day after my maiden speech in this house be elect on may and speak on the say then and still believe that wimbledon combine with raynes park motspur park and morden be the good place in the world to live we have unique suburban village revitalise town centre and business community which describe then as lively but which be now vibrant the tech sector in wimbledon be thrive and home to many brilliant company but think particularly of various company such as rockborne and med tech company which be change the way we can treat arthritis wimbledon have many small business and be often portray as leafy suburb but the reality be that as many people commute into wimbledon as commute out still believe it to be the good place to live and it have be an honour to represent it since announce be stand down have find people say what be your great achievement while in parliament suspect all colleague here can think of few be particularly proud of the fact that have be part of government who have transform school standard across britain that give life opportunity and life chance that be not there before be very pleased to be pps to the inspirational eric pickles and it be great honour to serve with my right hon friend the member for west suffolk matt hancock in his team as minister of state but what particularly remember be visit on may when hold my first surgery constituent come to that surgery as the flat above have flood her flat for six month she have want for piece of carpet to replace the carpet that have be take away that piece of carpet cost she come to as her last resort she have be to citizens advice and to the local council she have phone her local councillor take up the issue with the council and two week later cheque for arrive that be actually part of my proud achievement the service that and my team have give to thousand of people we should never forget that when we be here in this place there be the excitement the pressure the gossip the chance to have drink with friend but it be our work and help to our constituent that change their life believe that we act as the advocate for our constituent against authority in the wide sense of the word we should never forget that for that be the power of good be say something similar on the iain dale show about two year ago valerie from wimbledon phone in and say stephen hammond be wonderful mp he be really great for the local community iain dale say well sure he pleased to hear that she say doubt it labour voter and never go to vote for he but actually that be the whole point once we be here we be here to represent all our constituent we would like they all to vote for we but we know not all of they will for those colleague who be go out on the fight say remember that go out and fight for every vote for you know not where it may come and it may well serve you in time think of lot of thing that have hear in this chamber today and be pleased to have sit through so many wonderful speech one thing that think be important be that as member of parliament we should remember compassion what we do and how we help be hugely valuable it be bit like what my great friend my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst say centre right compassionate conservatism be the way forward for our party and it be the way back for our party to government particularly remember constituent who come to few year ago his wife have give birth to child in greece about or week premature she be airlift back to st george via various method her son be treat at the wonderful neonatal unit at st george that have have the pleasure and honour of visit several time meet that constituent few year later have be proud to campaign for summer bear child believe that summer bear child have the right to start school little later that improve their life and life chance it make they happy more confident more academically successful and more likely to achieve their real potential in life be grateful to successive ministers at the department for education who have listen and change the guidance to local council at least three time although that be not law it be now guidance and up and down the country summer bear child have benefit over the year much about this place have remain constant as many colleague have reflect there be still the camaraderie of friendship and the wisdom and knowledge of colleague to be fair also remember that on my first two day in the house two colleague mean very well tell how to run my constituency office and organise myself their version be completely contradictory what that tell all of we in this place be that the camaraderie bind we but we each represent individual and different constituency have always believe that everyone in this house of whatever political colour come here for the right reason all too often people forget that we be in this for the right reason and although as some colleague have reflect today politician be malign what we do in this place for our constituent be important almost everybody have meet have come here for the right reason the role of mps have change dramatically when arrive there be postbag every day now be lucky if get one letter but do get well over email every day which bring huge expectancy of fast and great response yet the reality be that sometimes the local council the housing authority and dare say it even government departments frustrate our ability to provide that for constituent we also have much great local role than ever before that be hugely important but we should not forget that we be elect to this place to contribute to national life as well in play that important local role we must remember that we be here to scrutinise and hold government to account that be become increasingly important since we leave the european union because there be great burden of scrutiny on this house join several colleague in mention that the coarseness of political discourse be concern and should be not just for the future but particularly for the next six week people should if possible talk about hope and the sunny upland and what they want to do for their constituent rather than badmouth opponent remember that they be in this for the right reason be pleased to see that the government have make some real step forward on social medium but some actor on social medium still engender political hate we must remain vigilant against that like so many colleague would like to use this oscar moment to say few thank yous thank the clerks and the doorkeepers and the police and security man who keep we safe many colleague have comment on the wonderful people in the tea room think that should acknowledge the people in the pugin room who always use to say ah mr hammond white burgundy family size always seem to arrive have be fortunate to have wonderful political conservative association in wimbledon thank all my friend there recognise like so many colleague that we be here only because we be part of team this be the conservative team and what do for my constituent be because of the team of people have over the year the team have include jerry sherman ben carleton jones charlie mcclelland alice hopkinson paul holmes can say that even though he be now my hon friend the member for eastleigh that must have be dark time in your office yes our productivity go down so do your majority laughter may gently advise the deputy chief whip of that when he be think about future government appointment jay crush miles jordan and louise stevens have also work with and put in extraordinary effort as ever my big thank like those of so many here be to my family to my wife who be look after her father today and to my daughter who be in the gallery no one could have wish for more supportive family they go through the up and down mainly down in my case of political life and put up with it so tolerantly finally thank the people of wimbledon who for the past year have put their trust in to represent they here to serve their interest and to look after they in this house it have be huge and extraordinary privilege to be member of this place for year as go do so like many with regret that be go but it the right time to pass on the torch be hugely privileged and thankful for have have the opportunity to be here for so long it be great pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for wimbledon stephen hammond who have be my good friend for many year before he become my hon friend we have long stand share interest in his that be perhaps not the appropriate thing to say give that his daughter and my goddaughter be in the gallery but we have be chum for long time have to admit that unlike many other hon colleague have have no hug in the last few day hon member ah that may be because have be in the mountain kingdom of lesotho far away from this place watch the incredible event of the last few day unfurl be able to come back here early in time to join this last hurrah to vote on something goodness know what it be just now and to speak in this valedictory debate many hon friend may not have be to lesotho the former prime minister my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may speak early about the importance of defend democracy it be interesting that there be small close commonwealth country friend that absolutely show love and respect for this house the speaker of the lesotho parliament say to that whenever he be vex by something about procedure or what he should do he always turn to the house of commons it be at different end of the planet and in another hemisphere but so many people around the world look to this place what we do here matter beyond our wall here beyond our shore and beyond our constituency it be really important that we all remember that apologise madam deputy speaker if look slightly dishevel and below par today but spend the last hour on series of plane to get back here today early people promise anecdote about various trip be not go to give any anecdote be not go to talk about go to syria with the now hon member for rochdale george galloway good grief go to yemen with keith vaz or go to greenland with mr deputy speaker my right hon friend the member

include you my right hon friend the member for maidenhead and various other only of those labour mp have survive to this day as well as the one ulster unionist who be now dup mp so on our side the intake be resilient as you and know only too well become an mp on may and will cease to be an mp on may next week which happen to be my birthday what birthday treat that be go to be first probably owe mr speaker an apology be one of the long serve member of the naughty corner or the rough trade corner as it have be know the source of much heckling noise and verbal exercise the source of that one famous quote at prime minister question time when the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn make the rookie mistake of leave question open ended he say that he have just be with his comrade in the european socialist group at the european parliament and guess what they say to he the heckle from this corner be who be you and various other heckle besides apologise for the heckling and the noise over the year but of course during the tenure of the previous speaker we wear badge of honour as member of the bbb club it be literal badge have try to find it that be hope this be in erskine bollocke by bercow club of which there be league table in the sunday times alongside story about those of we who have be upbraid by the speaker on the most occasion it certainly be badge of honour thank goodness that thing have move on and the quality of the chair have improve hugely over the past few year fuel by jelly baby in this corner as well as good banter and good camaraderie hope should leave little note that whoever occupy the naughty corner after the election be it on the opposition benches or the government benches uphold the good tradition that we have try to uphold as you and know madam deputy speaker it be privilege to be in public service it be privilege to be member of parliament to serve this house to serve as minister for those of we who have be give that opportunity for however fleeting time and to serve on select committees have be the deputy chairman of the home affairs committee for year now and those committees be one of the great strength of this house the home affairs committee be describe by quentin letts as probably the good committee in westminster in response to my right hon friend the member for norwich north chloe smith and her reference to deal with quentin letts have the great advantage because when first arrive and he be think the sketch writer on the daily telegraph he and be often mistake for each other in those day certainly we look quite similar so when he write up any reference to they be usually preface by the adonis like tim loughton the epitome of charm and handsomeness or whatever try look like the people who write the column rather than those who be write about in the column but the great privilege of course be to serve one constituent as my right hon friend the member for maidenhead have also say and as other have echo the first and last reference point of be an mp should be our constituent their problem be our nation problem and we need to understand those problem if we be to provide the solution for all of our country as many of we know goodness know it be go to be the case this time around the seat for which one be select be something of lottery indeed my right hon friend the member for maidenhead be go to be the candidate in east worthing and shoreham because the people compile the shortlist rather prefer she to but then she be select for maidenhead and so the way be clear sussex be where be bear grow up and go to school the constituency be where my relative live and where my father have go to school to have that sort of connection to one constituency be particularly special as many hon member have point out it have be joy to represent the good county in the united kingdom as its member of parliament for year be grateful to my constituent in constituency whose boundary have

constituency as my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart will testify thank all my staff and the many researcher and other who have work for over the year have never actually have to sack anybody which be quite surprise to my hon friend as other hon member have do thank all the staff of the house who make this place tick will not read they all out and will certainly not mention the bar staff who seem to get the big cheer from my colleague when they be mention the staff be the unsung hero who make democracy work so that we can do our job thank my civil servant from my time at the department for education the secret of have good civil servant be to have happy hour at the drink cabinet in my office be always open for those member of my private office who be still around do not think anyone would be allow to do that these day but it work really well if have particularly difficult subject that want civil servant to have meeting with on invite they during happy hour and give they very large gin and tonic and always get my way that be what good government be actually about as my colleague have do thank all the conservative party officer and volunteer who do all the work behind the scene in all weather which make it possible for we to get elect and do our job most of all be glad that many other hon member have mention this thank our family this be the most family unfriendly job it be particular irony for have be the shadow children minister for eight year and then the children minister that my job do not enable to be as good father as would like to have be when be first elect in my son hector be under three freya the gobby one to whom my hon friend the member for wimbledon be godfather be just one and tilly be minus six month we give up so much and our family give up so much more to enable we to do our job many other hon member include the right hon and learn member for camberwell and peckham ms harman who open the debate have say that this place have change lot and that it have change for the well and agree in the security briefing that we be give be five minute with police officer who give we our locker key and say right mr loughton you well put your name on everything crime happen in this place as well you know that be the entirety of the security briefing the only other briefing be nice minute video from betty boothroyd with wonderful vista of the river and the palace that be all the preparation we have thing have move on greatly be glad to say in those day we have all night sitting the good place to sleep be under the table in the strangers dining room fortunately those day have go when serve on my first finance bill committee with my right hon friend the member for bognor regis and littlehampton nick gibb we have to keep the business go until in the morning he and spend several hour read out the southern train timetable between worthing and bognor regis and talk about related matter to keep the committee go that sort of thing be bit silly and do not happen anymore so thing have get well echo the word of my right hon friend the member for maidenhead who say do want to go back into opposition we be both elect in only by may last year have we be in government for long than we have be in opposition for those long year beforehand and government be well end by urge future government on couple of issue on which feel strongly have champion hope the cause of child and young people particularly disadvantaged child in the care system as child minister work on reform child in care regulation and on adoption although be surprised to read in the biography of the former prime minister now the foreign secretary that that whole piece of work on adoption be actually his idea and only start after leave office but hey that politic we should never forget that child and young people be of the population but of our future we lose sight of that at our peril we have not do enough on child social care it be false economy not to do that as early as possible and not to work on prevention rather than have to fire fight the symptom of neglect that be why the best start for life programme champion by my right hon friend the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom and the first day which be something have be involve in be so important because it be life change if we deal with child and their parent at the beginning of their life not later in life future government need to remember that the work we do on child sexual exploitation and early year be also really important let turn to one piece of unfinished business have here copy of my private member bill always carry one around which be now the civil partnerships marriages and death registration etc act of which be very proud it have enable more than couple to have an opposite sex civil partnership since and have enable people get married to put the name of their mother on their marriage certificate something that have not happen since that may seem like little thing but it be bring home to when receive wonderful letter from somebody have never meet before whose daughter have just be marry in bath in the same church where he and his late wife have be marry he say that be able to put his late wife name on the marriage certificate make such difference and that it be as though she be actually there even though she be not there physically the bit of unfinished business be section which give power to coroner to investigate stillbirth it be as vital now as it be when that become law back in for the government to get on with it and issue the regulation urge the next government to treat that as priority the job have change the job think have get hard three people have be murder in my time here jo cox david amess and the police officer keith palmer social medium have make our job hard it have divide society and promote hate and the cancel culture but those of we who work here those of we who work together across the chamber across committees and across all party group all share that devotion to public service and make the life of our constituent and our nation well regardless of party difference will continue to work with friend across the political divide on other platform outside of parliament after year as party activist join at the age of eight election and year on the front bench hope that have make bit of difference through legislation in this place and bit of difference for my constituent and that have gain bit of respect for what have try to do finally there be an old adage that pose the conundrum what be the difference between knowledge and wisdom knowledge be know that tomato be fruit not vegetable but wisdom be know not to put tomato in fruit salad this place be full of knowledge but think we have see today that we be lose lot of wisdom from this chamber that be great sadness with various colleague move on for whatever reason but this place be source of wisdom when we use that wisdom wisely and with consensus across the house we can achieve great thing and we have be proud to have play small part in that after year still have not work out how to write beautiful speech listen to my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton remind of how eloquent he be and he will be sad loss to this house my entry into politic as wee boy from ardrossan you come from paisley madam deputy speaker so you will appreciate this be something of an unconventional background be influence by the colossus that be margaret thatcher be influence by grandmother who would shout at the television when ted heath be on be influence by mother who would walk through picket line to get to work because she have to work to keep roof over her head we be single parent family and she be grafter who always do the right thing and be influence by the scottish national party councillor across the road woman call marjorie forrest who be still alive to this day be influence by see election poster appear in the window and wonder what they be would see loud speaker appear on top of her car and wonder what they be think that politic and campaigning be something everyone do because see it in the house opposite but also see desperate people go to she to get help on simple matter that for person in desperate need be life change have carry that desire to help people with ever since as the many member in this chamber know that be not always see by the press and the medium and we do not often share it publicly because we see people at their low their most vulnerable their most frightened and their most scared we often see people when we be the last port of call and because we be the last port of call each and every one of we do everything we can to turn their situation around we can all think of situation where we have do that which make incredibly proud also think of how get here have follow the path of least resistance would have join the labour party in scotland because by that time we be down to seat and then we go down to none but be conservative so be my association deputy chairman be president of glasgow university conservative club fight for michael forsyth in stirling in and again in that defeat in really hurt and think never again shall we see that the first seat contest be glasgow govan the saying go fight dagenham and dagenham fight back trust there be thing call glasgow kiss that involve the forehead and no other part of the anatomy luckily avoid the glasgow kiss but have few close shave the day after the election wake up in my hotel room at the scottish event campus in glasgow pull back the curtain and say to mum that be my constituency over there and she say not any more it not if be your constituency yesterday but the election have be and go you have no connection with it any more that be not the first time that my mother bring back down to earth with bang the reality be that we build up relationship through the campaigning we do we be identify as be the conservative candidate or the conservative mp we take on issue that we never otherwise would we take on issue that we never otherwise would we do it because of our role but when that role get take away as be its very nature some of those relationship will change that for will be one of the thing will find very hard fight selby in and be suppose to win michael howard even come to selby to close the national election and that same night tony blair go to scarborough to close labour campaign so my advice to any candidate in the selection be to not have the leader of the opposition in your constituency on the eve of the poll if you be labour mp and think you will win or the prime minister if you be tory mp and think you will win we gain scarborough and we lose selby take it from sometimes candidate be well leave on your own fail to get reselecte for selby be suppose to be fast track and all the rest of it but be not that be painfully low point for my mum come into my bedroom one saturday morning and my duvet be over my head have be have my duvet over my head lot recently and she say listen you fight two parliamentary seat most people never get to fight one those be her word of wisdom she be try to be helpful but respond by say no fight two parliamentary seat and the next one fight be go to win that become my sole focus and my drive and determination be bless that get fylde seat that have never be to before in my life until apply to be honest but one naturally fit with it be beautiful constituency and one with so much diversity it have everything from bae systems which be build the typhoon fighter jet to westinghouse which make nearly all of the uk nuclear fuel and so many other diverse business it be also very beautiful people look at lytham st annes on map next to blackpool and think it must be challenging place shall we say but it be not madam deputy speaker you have talk about your visit to the clifton arms hotel in lytham which be certainly very fine establishment lytham st annes continue to go from strength to strength it be not posh blackpool it be lytham st annes there be many other fine town in the constituency be very proud to be able to secure regeneration money for kirkham and see the town on the up have leader of the council and various other people tell multiple time that the link road would never happen that it be too complicated that there be just too many different funding pot that keep flood about say will get that link road build it nearly kill it take year but that link road be open next month it be something that other find too complicated too boring or too detailed but that be my legacy because sometimes boring and detailed be what make the wheel turn so when people drive over that link road just spare little thought for the timing of my departure unlike for some people be not entirely of my choosing there be much work intend to carry on say to whoever succeed that will stay out of their way or will give advice it be entirely up to they that apply to whether that person be from my party or another when become member of parliament get no support from my predecessor to be frank come in here one night feel like cinderella have three big bag and have be invite to reception the first of many but be sit up in committee room with three giant sack of mail the only reason know have mail be that see people come in with these green envelope go down to the post office that use to be down here and say have get any mail by any chance he say oh yes mr menzies you have lot of mail when ask how much he say this much and there be three sack be set up there open it all so know what it feel like at the start my advice to any new member start be to find that mail as soon as you can we have talk about campaign and the thing we have secure and we have talk about casework as other member have say the people who deliver that be our parliamentary staff have be bless to have have some of the most outstanding and loyal people over the last year which appreciate now more than ever shirley have be my office manager from day one and adam have be with for the last five year also have liam roger small and max smith they be the team who go out day in day out do the detailed work and make look good they allow to go on foreign trip or do stuff on select committee while casework be be do when have be look after my mum they have allow not to be here while casework be be do some of my early staff be now earn multiple time what earn maybe that be because recruit bright talented people or maybe it be just because mp be not destine to earn lot of money but the one thing that be sure be that all my staff will be earn lot more money than will be in few week time even the most junior member with that in mind have to think about look to the future say to my staff you be brilliant people whatever you go on to do people will be very lucky to have you we too be lucky to have the people who support we in our role be they the doorkeepers who be incredibly polite and who know more about what be go on in this place than anyone else or the people who work in the tea room and keep we feed think back to the horrible day when pc keith palmer be murder during the terrorist attack on westminster bridge my hon friend the member for romford andrew rosindell and leave parliament and get to the rope line at lambeth bridge gladys the elderly lady who work in the tea room be wait behind the rope line because she want to make sure that her member be okay that be the level of dedication it be not about make bit of toast it be about care my goodness the staff of this house care would like to point out that the people who work in health and wellbeing which be not always talk about and which until recently be not as good as it should have be for member have help many people include the pressure on mps be extraordinary regardless of whether it come from the long hour be away from family the demand on we or social medium that pressure be huge so urge the parliamentary authority to keep invest in health and wellbeing and to look after mps be they those who be currently serve or those who will come into this house after the next election they should be nurture and cherish because they be people who want to do good but they be also fragile soul in my time here have never be minister start off by be pps my first minister get sack and my second minister get sack so when be appoint as sir alan duncan pps he be frightened because my track record be not good one where come into my own be be trade envoy again my advice to colleague come into parliament after the next election be that you should sometimes be polite but also know when to stamp your foot because occasionally just occasionally the squeaky wheel get oil it be after the election that think stuff this want to be do something so create merry hell about my desire to become trade envoy to be fair the right hon member for south staffordshire sir gavin williamson phone up the next day and say know you want to be trade envoy for argentina but we go to appoint you trade envoy for colombia peru and chile how do you feel about that bite his hand off argentina be then add year later have serve as trade envoy for seven year at the time of brexit and huge change in this country it be something that be incredibly relevant and feel really privileged to be out there bat for british business sometimes really small business when be in colombia in february we be help cheese supplier from the constituency of mr deputy speaker the right hon member for ribble valley mr evans to enter the colombian market that be small supplier enter the global stage as result of what we do as trade envoy secure the large ever infrastructure deal in latin america be the chairman of the uk peru infrastructure taskforce and we secure billion infrastructure deal the large in live memory with the help of sir mark kent who be now the chief executive of the scotch whisky association we also get argentina to unilaterally drop its whisky tariff boost scotch export expert we should always be careful of expert tell that that would not happen they have be work on it for year and they think argentina would want something in return sometimes you draw on your past experience and my experience of work in retail be that sometimes you put forward simple offer or simple ask and you make they see that the number stack up we do that and three week later argentina sign the unilateral dropping of scotch whisky tariff my advice to people be if someone tell you something be too difficult or complicated do believe they some of the good advice get in my early day as an mp be be kind to the house and the house will be kind to you have see people who on occasion have not be kind to the house fall by the wayside my dear friend sir david amess whom miss terribly to this day be incredibly kind to would go and see he often daily and we would chat thing over he be always there as stalwart support he say to do try and be too clever never be too political because sometimes that boot will be kick your backside he be right sometimes we hold strongly different view not just from opposition members but from those on our own side take brexit for example but there be much more that unite we than divide we will try to bring my comment to some sort of natural conclusion this be where wish have allow adam to write my speech the one thing that have keep go be the privilege of serve fylde my constituent be fantastic kind lancashire people who want the good for their community always strove to deliver that for they the fylde that leave behind be well fylde than inherit many people will be able to say that about their respective constituency would also like to thank the people who take on the many trip over the year be once accuse by the medium of be the second most travelled mp in parliament object strongly from gibraltar lot of the travel do my trade envoy work and my inter parliamentary union work for example be not something that would appear on the register of members financial interests in actual fact get more than my fair share of trip as result become more rounded and well balanced member of parliament it allow to see

prince sultan and prince khalid at the saudi embassy for open my eye to country that know nothing about but which my constituency depend on for job have more people work in the kingdom of saudi arabia

over the last three year she have be in hospital time she have almost die five time and officially be put on end of life twice she be but she be still go strong if my mum can cope with all that get through adversity and demonstrate what true resilience look like so too can do not know what the future hold for but be optimistic because the experience and friendship that have earn in this place will do nothing but stand in good stead some thing would change for sure but the majority of it would not it have be an honour and privilege you be my friend you be my family will miss you but will see you around thank you very much and god bless shall be brief mainly because have to leave shortly to collect my son from nursery like many other member here want to start with thank to family the immense patience of my wife over the past year with my career in politic have be something to behold but my mother have deal with year of have husband or son as member of parliament for worcester she have do immense service to the constituency and to our country from the way she support my father and she have be an inspiration to want to very briefly talk about my passion for education make my maiden speech on the importance of education it be great to hear from my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton and indeed my hon friend the member for wimbledon stephen hammond who speak about what we have be able to do as government for education have be bang on about school funding for my entire time in parliament it be deeply nerdy subject but it be vital and colleague on both side of the house have engage in the debate we have make some real stride but there be much more to do point to recommendation of the education committee with regard to properly fund the work of teach assistant in school as key objective for the next parliament we have have some great debate with contribution from member on both side of the house about the importance of meet special educational need the house pass some fantastic legislation in but it have not achieve its objective and weneed to ensure that those need be well fund in the future have be honour to chair the education committee for the last year or so pay tribute as have everyone else to all the staff in the house but pay particular tribute to the clerks of our select committees who work incredibly hard behind the scene to ensure that we can produce great recommendation on cross party basis they help to produce report just last week have it here and commend it to the house give some of the comment that we have hear from hon member in all part of the house about the challenge of social medium be delighted that we be able to hold meeting yesterday in the reasons room where the brilliant hon member for gateshead ian mearns be able to deliver cross party support for our report on screen time seriously recommend that the next government from whatever side they come engage with the recommendation of that report to well protect our child from the peril of social medium think there be real concern about that across all party in the house and there be stride that can be make let end by thank my constituent in worcester for give the privilege of my life by enable to serve such wonderful constituency and thank colleague across the house for be such great friend alas we find ourselves here never think would be speak for the last time in this chamber let alone do so under the age of indeed never think would even make it here before the age of my former boss my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg often say that make he feel exceptionally old because his former intern have not only make it to parliament but be retire before he my thank go to he for all the wisdom that he have pass on over the year there be an irony be there not in stand up in place where word be of paramount importance and then find it difficult to find word to express the bittersweet nature not only of have serve in this place but of leave this place so many people have say today that be member of parliament be an honour that be one of the most horrendously clichéd word we can use but also one of the truest because it be an honour and it be privilege as mps we have the opportunity to really make difference to make difference to the individual we help through casework and the family whose life we touch day in day out to make difference to whole community and of course to make difference to our entire country think we all know if we search deep down that the reason we want to be here be that we want to make difference and to try to make the world well place say that not just of colleague on this side of the house but of those right across it because think we be all unite in have come here with good intention however this be also huge responsibility you stand up every day and have to search your soul to do what be right sometimes it be easy to know which way you will vote but at other time it be very difficult especially when you find yourself on the opposite side of the argument to friend family colleague and many constituent although your constituent will definitely be the one to let you know when you be on the opposite side to they ultimately we all have to look ourselves in the mirror and know that we have make the right decision have be proud of most of the decision have make in this place although think we can all say that we be human and have make mistake and there may be thing that we would change have use the word lot already and shall probably use it lot more but so many colleague have express the sentiment that this be not single man sport but team sport would not have be able to achieve anything in this place and mean anything without my incredible team joanne howey niki trotter james middleton and the two who be up in the public gallery jack bell and ellie varley be an only child have never have sibling but through do this job and hire those two incredible people up in the gallery have gain brother and sister they be not get rid of just yet or if they be it be only as boss never as sibling we have achieve some incredible thing here but what make proud on national level be the awareness that my team and have manage to bring to the issue of one punch assault only last week be here in the chamber make an emotional speech one of the few emotional speech have make be tear up little not expect to have to make another for while talk about the impact of my dad death through single punch how that have motivate and all the work that have do and the incredible people have meet those at one punch uk and other family campaign to improve awareness and improve the outcome for victim secure some brilliant commitment from the government which be now laugh be it give that will have to have to fight the next government to make sure that they carry those over they can rest assure that will not be off their back until get those commitment honour once the election have pass thank all the activist and local volunteer who put in so much effort to help get to this place particularly thank councillor richard bell the conservative group leader in durham he be also now deputy leader of the council because back in through massive effort from all our volunteer and

the decision have make but who have handle all the communication and the debate well and with respect this place be such an adventure do not just mean get lose in my first few week here when would accidently find myself in the kitchen or on rooftop where be not suppose to be find be here as young woman particularly funny because mine be not the face of traditional mp as most people like to

every step of the way this place sometimes feel bit like battle certainly the bit that we see on tv the punch and judy of prime minister question look like battle but there be also the battle of idea in which we often fight so well and so constructively even when we disagree think back to the battle against covid when this house really come together in the good possible way fight not among

election we name it five five five because we predict year in advance the date of the election at that time it be not that difficult to predict they say year will go quickly but year have now pass which be amazing want to thank the people who select and elect must have be do something right because at each election more people have vote for than at the previous election jot down few bit of advice but when re read they after hear former prime minister talk about democracy and former secretary of state talk about defence and defence spending they seem little low level this be my advice anyway let someone else manage your bloody email it be absolutely dreadful and drive mad eat less and perhaps more importantly drink less join the armed force parliamentary scheme which be absolutely amazing and superb for find out about colleague and the service value family over politic and do not covet other success help they achieve that success my team have be fantastic pindie fanibe run my office call she the boss every now and again be allow to make decision marcus llewelyn bowen sorry llewellyn rothschild that be freudian slip he be very flamboyant my marcus he be register blind and

individual he stand against twice as the ukip candidate but then become my agent and be now my employee be sure he will carry on also thank sam pettengall who hope to see leave politic and join the royal navy certainly as reserve and cheryll gardiner whose son luke will hopefully come to this place as derbyshire member of parliament on my hon friend point about loyalty to he today in the chamber we have speak lot about how important it be for woman to come to this place but woman do not come to this place without good man behind they this will do nothing for your reputation but you be the good man who bring into this place know that you may sometimes regret it but there be few people in this world who meet young woman twice each time for less than half an hour and then when an election be announce move they into their house the next day open their home to they and put their entire life aside to fight every day for that person it be no surprise that you have such loyalty from your team because your heart be so enormous and without you would not be here be so grateful to you and to katy and your kid who allow that to happen you be phenomenal man and will very much miss you in this place you be not go to make cry thank my hon friend and do think we need to change whom we elect as candidate for number of reason hope be replace by woman in rochford and southend east or

want to mention my wife because she work for and also because would get in trouble if do not mention she we have three lovely child and be go to spend more time look after our new arrival the one year old it happen to be labrador dog which be prove to be much hard than the child would not recommend come to this place and it be the good job in the world have no regret serve year include nine year on the front bench in five different department under three prime ministers particularly enjoy the camaraderie of the whips office at one point hold the title of the most sack minister in the conservative government like to think of it as the most reappointable minister in troubled time but other may disagree be the minister that take through the withdrawal act have vote three time against that as bill have never vote against the government before be particularly proud of my time as minister for africa something get to do twice build on my previous work as banker in africa that be something would very much like to do think be go to do at least another year that be not the right thing for now but it have be brilliant look at everyone or would look at everyone if have keep my glass on and can think of moment of joy with they moment of sadness an embarrassing moment revelation revelation thank my right hon friend it have be absolutely superb will miss this place and say thank you to everyone who have serve in the broad way this house just before call the next hon gentleman the hon member for rutland and melton make an impassione intervention correct one make an excellent point but she keep refer to the hon gentleman as you this upset so much can not let it go because what if when be not here which will be very soon nobody bother what if we descend into just an ordinary place where people use first name nickname you or sloppy language and wear white trainer it just would not be right this be very special place and the fact that we call each other the hon member and use the third person and not the second person be part of the way that we do thing here with dignity and precision and by step back from the personal appreciate that what the hon lady have just say be personal and this be personal debate there be nothing wrong with that but in debate about political topic it be very important to keep the personal out of it and stick to the fact that be why it be so important that we respect the rule of speak through the chair and refer to people not as you but as the hon gentleman or the hon lady simply can not miss my last opportunity to say that and so hope it will not be forget thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to catch your eye for what will be the last time in my year in this place like all member who have speak in this wonderful debate it be go to be great wrench to leave the house the only person who may have slight skip in his step be mr speaker who will no long have to consider the many application for urgent question that have submit over the year it have be wonderful time and as briefly as can want to thank all those who have make it possible as all other hon member have do want to thank everybody who work here little do they realise but they be support great parliamentary system want to thank the doorkeepers the caterer the security staff and the librarians want to thank everybody who work here without exception they keep the show on the road every single one of they support our great parliamentary system we thank they for that reflect for moment suggest that much have change since join the house in and almost all for the well for start the hour be much more family friendly as green mp in there be no briefing my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton basically make the point that we be throw into the chamber would not say literally and tell to get on with it and learn thing have also change for the well in that we have many more lady mp which have be great improvement to the house thing have change for the well but what have not change for the well have be narrative that have grow strong in recent time and in certain quarter that our parliamentary system be break and not perform as it should would contend that that be not true while accept that it be not perfect do believe that it be representative and effective and be respect around the world for example it manage to contain the brexit debate probably the most passionate debate that we have have in generation and channel it accordingly in an open way that think few other country could have pull off this chamber remain the crucible where the matter of the day be debate and resolve its fulcrum be the obligation that we all tell the truth in this place we should never forget that mps can still effect great change like other colleague look back with fondness and satisfaction at the campaign and good cause that have participate in whether campaign for our manifesto to contain the promise of an eu referendum against arm the syrian rebel for official recognition and support of our nuclear test veteran great funding for the british council or secure focus on outcome when it come to cancer as be embody in section of the health and care act thank all colleague many of they be in their place who support that effort of course one have not always be successful none of we be we can all list our somewhat disappointment oppose our iraq libya and afghanistan intervention and despite the passionate debate that we have on those occasion we still intervene it be another sadness to that we do not manage to do more at the time to get the government to think again about defence cut my amendment in on the northern ireland backstop be defeat by the large record parliamentary majority in history to it be still fresh in the mind remind colleague that one just have to keep go on perseverance have quality all of its own and my goodness there be time in those year when we need it have hear so many interesting speech in the chamber this afternoon and it have be real pleasure to be part of this debate but would suggest to colleague that humility be also great quality we should never forget that be remind of that recently by my constituency team who put it to that in all the election have fight since the less time spend in the constituency the more my majority go up indeed that be true have have an increase majority in every single general election will not say that be not very diligent constituency mp but perhaps perhaps have ease off just little bit since overall would say that with hard work and perseverance and by garner support when need mp can still effect change and truly help their constituent occasionally with the help of the occupant of the chair as you well know mr speaker it be nice to see you in your place and now that you be here may thank you personally for everything you do for this place you be the guardian of something very precious in that chair and your presence there have be real source of strength and support for member across the house in make sure that our parliamentary system remain true to itself and do not meander thank you very much indeed mr speaker have enjoy my time on select committees and all party group which be where we see the good of cross party work that be something we all value in this place concur with the many observation make by colleague that we be at our very good if we can foster consensus across the divide and move an issue forward like many other have certainly benefit from cross party consensus when we have be able to engineer it come back to the effectiveness of this place and the minority of individual increasingly noisy though they be who say that this place be break or not effective or that it need to be improve because it do not represent its constituent that view be completely wrong and say that as somebody who have be in this place for year and there be colleague who have be here much long than this place be effective and we should remember that would therefore caution against ill thought through sweeping reform which will harm our democracy past innovation such as the fixed term parliaments act have serve to highlight the wisdom of convention would suggest we should be wary of talk of for example write constitution proportional representation or house of lords reform we should be careful what we wish for we be here courtesy of the accumulate wisdom of previous generation we discard that experience and wisdom at our peril if we do not consider thing very carefully wish all colleague well past and present and wish those stay on good fortune in the next parliament will certainly be keep in touch with many friend my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis very good friend have be sit next to for most of this debate although he have have to go and there be many other colleague here who look forward to keep in touch with after leave naturally would like to thank my constituency association along with councillor activist and the many friend have make in the constituency for their contribution and friendship over so many year the association stand by on number of occasion when do not always agree with my party the close come to be remove as an mp be in it be not an election year but there be an extraordinary general meeting to be go to say to deselect which think be what it be in effect because of the way vote on the iraq war opinion be very divided as colleague may remember see my hon friend the member for south norfolk mr bacon good friend sit on the bench at the front who will remember that moment have vote against my whip have to resign from the front bench that cause stir in the association but we get through it and since then have have no issue at all with my association over not always agree or not agree should say with our intervention in libya or afghanistan post the association understand that mp be representative not delegate would like to thank my constituent for their support and for ensure that win increase majority over the year be go to stay connected to my wonderful constituency of basildon and billericay which it have be great honour to serve by participate in the annual fun walk it be now charity that found in since then it have raise around million for good cause across the constituency and beyond may be step down as the mp but will certainly stay connected to the local area by stay involve with that charity event as chair of the trustee would like to thank my staff to whom owe so much my constituency team jo turner and annie akinin have be with since become an mp my london team claire lumby selina short and benjamin yates who be sit in the gallery have be with for up to year they have year of service between they which be rarity in this place and my constituent have benefit as result be very grateful to they and be proud of they for everything we have achieve together finally would like to thank my wife thalia my daughter and my wide family whether they be still with we or not for their support over the year it have always add perspective and balance to my endeavour in this place which shall miss it have be great honour to serve but the time have come to move on and wish you all well have one remain message for my party please stay wed to the centre ground when fight general election be an old fashioned one nation tory and compassionate conservatism be the way forward do not want we to wander off to the right do not think we be go to because we must stay centred deliver economic efficiency strong finance robust economy and all the rest of it be not an end in itself it be means to help the less fortunate in society and we have to remain wed to that idea the prime minister understand this and wish he well at the next general election it be nice to see you in the chair mr speaker thank you for all your service and for the kindness that you have show since you have be in the chair when be in my early teen have day out in london send my parent postcard of this building and rather arrogantly and presumptuously write on the back my future office have forget all about it but when my father pass away just few day after the last general election find that postcard in his house guess the dream come true and they keep it for all those year have win four general election and will be the first and last mp for winchester and chandler ford because the boundary change will break up the constituency have say from the very start that nobody own winchester would like to think that win the seat because work so hard to get it and would like to think that keep it because do the job to the good of my ability every single day equally nobody own the key to no downing street the future have not be write yet and contrary to what people may read this election be not over like many colleague wish my conservative friend stand on july the very good especially my right hon friend the prime minister who be hard work decent man we be very lucky to have he as our country leader will not detain the house but want to reflect on two thing and to thank people for just be an mp be enough it be clearly mission of mine from very young age work with my right hon friend the member for south west

england to zero new transmission by and we will do so extend the human papillomavirus vaccine to boy which be not something that my teenage son thank for give that he have to have it the other day

be famous by the way my wife will get very cross if do not mention her dog calouste as be lie there pat his head and thinking of what want to say be remind about story hear from colleague in the tea

there be no point in become an mp unless one become minister one hop that he will learn quite lot before he ever get anywhere near this place if he do at all because plainly that be completely incorrect my colleague story remind of another one particularly in this week when we have finally right the long stand injustice of the infected blood scandal remember alistair burt stand around here talk about it at the end of the parliament and that be very recently in relation to the length of that scandal and the post office horizon scandal remember that as leave the public accounts committee in after some year tony collins the renowned computer journalist telephone about it luckily because be then involve in other matter to do with housing james arbuthnot and many other in this place take it up very seriously as we finally correct those wrong this week and be remind of other huge wrong over many decade such as the one correct by the work of those include andy burnham the hillsborough scandal and of other great work by many other great colleague be remind of another story consider the follow investigation into the allegation have reveal they to be mixture of unsubstantiated rumour incorrect information or repetition of early allegation which have be fully investigate and find to be unsupported by the fact question be that official statement aim at refute public disquiet about the efficacy of measure take against foot and mouth the reliability of the army rifle and radio set in kosovo and sierra leone government order that police should keep protester out of sight during the state visit of the president of china the possibility that bse can cross the species barrier to human the loss of an raf chinook helicopter and twenty five security personnel on the mull of kintyre the existence of illness collectively know as gulf war syndrome the export to iraq of machine tool capable of arm manufacture the circumstance surround the torpedoing of the belgrano the radiation sickness claim by some participant in the british atomic test of the which my hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr baron have so assiduously campaign on have even join by telephone surgery that have with my constituent because know that he know more about that matter than anyone else experiment carry out at porton down during the same period the denial of full pension to thousand of disabled ex servicemen and their widow for over fifty year or the loss of the carrier hms glorious and her two escort in the answer be that the statement be make by the ministry of defence in december to refute body of opinion that there might indeed be condition refer to as gulf war syndrome but it could just as well have be those other we all know this it be phenomenon that tim slessor in his book ministries of be quote from here refer to as the whitehall loop at its simple this be the closed circuit procedure where in reply to question ask of government department or minister the answer be put together by the very same civil servant whose early judgement be both the subject and the cause of the inquiry in the first place remember bump into simon burns who be at the time the health minister responsible for the national programme for it in the health service the npfit as it be call there be at least eight other ministers during that period track it closely from to would not recommend that anyone read it unless they have particularly masochistic disposition but in the book that write about government devote an entire chapter to the npfit where lovingly detail the many way in which what be then call connect for health manage to conceal information about how badly thing be go one day simon burns come up to in the tea room and say richard be sick and tired of be tell thing by you and then find out six month later that they be true the truth be that whether it be on the child support agency the criminal records bureau the tax credit scandal the rural payments agency scandal which have lead some farmer sadly to commit suicide the student loans company or the recruitment of junior doctor or many many other thing it be our constituent who through we as their member of parliament keep government honest they so often know far more about how government be actually work than the government themselves do that be why we need members of parliament who see their chief job as represent and protect their constituent and as require the government of the day of whichever political complexion to justify themselves and to keep explain their action be delighted to see my friend the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge back in her place of the various thing have do in the year have be here have not find any more consequential or more fun than the work we do together when be her deputy chairman on the public accounts committee between and she perform an extraordinary service and by the way write great book about it call to account which hon member may wish to read it say next in my note dame eleanor say but that be because when write they you be not in your seat madam deputy speaker as you yourself say yesterday mps of all party be the people who do not just shout at the television but get up and do something about it official report may vol it be an honourable estate it be an honourable calling it be one of the most important thing we can do it be worth devote oneself to to the point of exhaustion in order to keep our people free and to keep our government honest it say here self commission housing so suppose have well say word about that before conclude it be well know that for the past year or so since steer through the self build and custom housebuilding act have work very hard to try to implement that see the former prime minister my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may nod remember bounce up to she in the lobby many year ago when she be prime minister and say be it true that self build housing be discuss at cabinet this morning she say yes be sorry to report that there be still more to do see the hon member for manchester central lucy powell in her place nearly succeed in coax she into give evidence for the report do in for the then prime minister it be several prime ministers ago we have have quite few there be some excellent recommendation in there some of which have even be implement write to the current housing secretary on march with some detailed suggestion about how the recommendation might be implement will sit down in one or two minute but must place on the record my huge gratitude to the culture secretary my right hon and learn friend the member for south east cambridgeshire lucy frazer who when she be housing minister allow to introduce she to one of the nation lead planning silk silk to silk they talk through the issue and the thing be propose my right hon and learn friend say to her official what wrong with this and they could not provide she with an answer so that now sit on the statute book as section of the levelling up and regeneration act hope that future government will do their good to implement it and shall certainly be encourage they to do so in conclusion will just say this it have always be an article of faith to that there be no they just we if there be thing we want to fix and change it be we who have to do it as karl popper put it be not jealous of many thing but be jealous of the right hon member for barking because she be at the london school of economics when he be still teach there progress depend on we on our watchfulness and our effort on the clarity of our conception of our aim and on the reasonableness of their choice instead of pose as prophet we must be the maker of our fate it be great honour to be the last speaker on the back benches in this debate we have hear great emotion from many people and realise that it be such wrench for many people to leave parliament it have be an honour for all of we to serve but particularly for to serve as the member of parliament for hendon have be intimately involve in eight parliamentary election in the past year in many way in some seat it be no great achievement for someone to be elect it be in the marginal seat that it be an achievement we be the one that have change government thank my constituent in hendon for elect on four occasion at the last election receive vote the high number of conservative vote in the constituency since it sometimes irk when be first elect in that have majority of and over people have elect while there be other sit on different benches who have receive few vote than but have huge majority that do not feel quite right each and every member present will claim that their constituency be different from everyone else but hendon just like london be very diverse as someone who be bear and grow up in the south of england and never see person of colour until the age of be in hendon do not come as great shock to but it have teach huge amount have large jewish constituency large muslim constituency hindus the large chinese community outside of soho and manchester and the large iranian community in the whole country there be many issue that connect those different religious group which have always campaign on but there have also be huge amount of diversity in the local economy we have see huge development mean that the boundary change that have be apply will make difference under the previous conservative council when be councillor we introduce development that create the stonegrove estate the grahame park estate beaufort park west hendon upper fosters and the peel centre all make home for people in their local area and we should be very grateful for that as say have work on issue that have bring community together but the reason why have focus on the jewish community be that they be small number in this country about the number of muslims in this country be more like million and their voice will be hear by the different members of parliament in this place my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy raise issue of concern to many of my constituent issue about antisemitism and education but be pleased that this week lord pickles publish his report of the alderney expert review lay to rest the issue of concentration camp on british soil during the second world war my hon friend the member for brigg and goole have see other thing as well particular issue of concern to my constituent be that of israel which be understandable my hon friend and visit israel few week after the october attack we visit kfar aza and only wish that each and every member here in parliament could experience what we do have not say this before but my hon friend say to that he could not take picture during that day and tell he that we must just as bert hardy and other photographer go into bergen belsen and the other concentration camp say we have to go there and take picture so that the world know this really do happen we have have people say that it do not happen but can assure you madam deputy speaker that it do would be one of those hawkish members who want to see the issue in gaza resolve but do not believe ceasefire now would achieve that do not want to see any death on any side but when member say recently in debate that there have be civilian death try to challenge that we do not know how many of those people be civilian and how many be hamas fighter the foreign office say that it have not make prediction of that number but we do know that of people in gaza support hamas and hamas have get to be remove the decision of ireland norway and spain this week to recognise an independent palestinian state be not only wrong but allow the conclusion to emerge that terrorism work and we can not allow that it be simply impossible to recognise state that have never exist in any meaningful form so what exactly be those country recognise gently say to the premier of spain and ireland that they have never particularly recognise their minority community my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may say that you should never ask question in this place if you do not know the answer there be an occasion when ask the former prime minister now lord cameron if he would visit israel have to say that one of the good experience of be in parliament be the moment when visit lord cameron in his suite at the king david hotel we walk past the guy with machine gun guard he and we sit and drink whisky with he have to say that it be not that different from sit on the throne in saddam hussein palace in baghdad of course without saddam hussein and with whisky we have live through an extraordinary period in this parliament people often ask what be the good part of be an mp find that easy to answer it be the people particularly the constituent the story that they tell be sometimes heart wrench often annoying regularly amusing and always interesting have have great people work with in the constituency some political some not particularly think of people like val duschinsky and hugh rayner who work with in the hendon association as well as rabbi ginsbury simon rea and mushtaq rehman the respective leader of their religious community activist such as rupa monerawela richard nash and manubhai makwana have be great support to there be also individual such as ari leaman who have do so much for the teenage community and lorraine bushell for the grandparents association be ask what be the big mistake that have ever make as member of parliament that be easy to answer it be on the military action in libya when walk past my hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr baron and think how he go to explain why he vote against this but we not only create fail state but significantly contribute to the current immigration and asylum crisis that be my big mistake and bitterly regret it the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge say that be an mp be not what it use to be and she be correct several year ago be on boat and the skipper say what be it you say that you do for living say do before long one of the other crew say well it can be as bad as be member of parliament it be still vital to be member of parliament those who come after we will recognise that leave on one note that be particularly sad about for year have complain about sewage in our river and our sea not much have change over the last year all that have change be that the government have implement scheme for monitor the amount of sewage that go into our river and our sea the lib dems be make this central plank of their election campaign they should be advise that their mp vote against the super sewer here in london so they do not have good record on the issue in my opinion the eu directive be never fit for purpose so while minister have repeatedly claim that water quality be improve it be simply not it be the way that water quality be measure such claim lead to conclude that this be the same kind of behaviour by ministers that be witness in the contaminated blood scandal have be elect continuously for the last year for the last as the member of parliament for hendon have take huge toll on that be why have decide to step down but would not change it for thing be look forward to ameet jogia the conservative candidate take forward what we have achieve he be not only bear in the constituency but be local candidate have to thank my staff for the work that they have do over the last few year in this parliament alone they have undertake piece of casework have have good staff who have remain friend begin with laura pike hannah evans ness hirst and katherine toone and now with eamonn walsh george bose carolynne fisher and steve martin who volunteer and hilary smith who have be with for the last year they have really be true public servant as be say they be the one who ensure that the work be actually complete of course can not forget maximus decimus meridius my jack russell max who still attend parliament on occasion he have enable to concentrate on animal welfare issue so in the spirit of roman language say veni vidi vici just before we come to the wind up speech hope that the house will indulge bend the rule for moment or two to say few word before vacate the chair for the last time which be very difficult thing to do the first time sit in this chair imagine that it would make feel like somebody with power and grandeur tell you feel like alice in wonderland you know that picture of alice shrink and the chair get big because think this chair be awfully big and awfully small it still feel like that would like first to say few word about the other occupant of this chair the team make up of the speaker and the deputy speakers my dear friend and colleague the first deputy chairman of ways and means the right hon member for doncaster central dame rosie winterton the second deputy chairman of ways and means my right hon friend the member for ribble valley mr evans and my right hon friend the member for north thanet sir roger gale together with mr speaker make

lady and gentleman in the tea room especially mary and godfrey who always keep some fish and chip on friday when the tea room close before the house rise of course also thank the lady and gentleman in the pugin room sometimes we be last in there too be we mr deputy speaker do tell anybody could never have manage without jackie and kelly downstairs they know who they be they know how much we rely on and care about they there be quite few ayes and hear hear around the chamber mostly but not entirely from lady may also thank the people who have maintain my constituency office and my private office be lucky to have such loyal colleague all of whom have also become great friend of mine and of each other there have be very few of they over span of year because they have all stay for very long time really do not know how they have the patience to deal with day in day out could not do it thank in particular debbie jess karen beverly carol iona gilly frankie tom sophie and sean epping forest conservative association be brilliant team see that the hon member for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra who be once its chairman be sit on the front bench acknowledge and agree with what say the association have provide great many colleague in this place notably as well as my hon friend our late friend james brokenshire it will be good to take moment to remember he and the other colleague

will transform the leasehold housing market and the life of million of leaseholder across england and wales our reform to lease extension and the buying of freehold will give family and individual security which be core conservative principle give more leaseholder the freedom to manage their own building will empower they to make important decision themselves such as choose management company that deliver good quality work at reasonable price and will require management company to up their standard and give leaseholder well deal in order to retain and win business on service charge leaseholder must be give more information as to what be be do to their property and what they be actually pay for the requirement for landlord and management company to specify exactly what the service charge entail will encourage high standard among those company and empower leaseholder to challenge poor service that be because transparency be core conservative value too similarly our building insurance reform will stop leaseholder be charge exorbitant opaque commission on top of their premium and tackle the proven case of insider trading in the market fairness be another core conservative principle then we turn to the million of freeholder live on new estate who be impact by poor service bad management and opaque fee those estate and the property on they bring joy security

rent cap we know that ground rent turn to peppercorn if there be legal extension and we ought to get to that as fast as we can if on the way we have to stop at year that be fine the last thing be that we need to recognise that move to commonhold be the only way forward to ensure an effective housing market we ought to stop new residential leasehold property be sell and we ought to find way to help exist leaseholder avoid face penalty from external landlord who can go into all sort of bad behaviour whether on insurance commission or other way of take money off leaseholder improperly that would be in the interest of both landlord and leaseholder congratulate the government and thank the minister for his attendance be very grateful to the opposition for help persuade the prime minister that
