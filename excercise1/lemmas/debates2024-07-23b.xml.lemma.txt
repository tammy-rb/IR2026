about where exactly it take place but it be safe to say that it have cement our place in the history book since then we have continue to play our part in british history from be immortalise in the novel the ragged trousered philanthropists to be the birthplace of television perhaps what define we most though be our community spirit underpin by our volunteer and charity who do so much our calendar be full of carnival and festival from jack in the green to bonfire night those event be make possible only by volunteer who give up their time to give back to the community and raise money for our local charity volunteer also maintain and protect so many of our amazing public space from hastings country park to rye harbour nature reserve and camber sands there be also some point of our history that we would rather forget such as the unveiling of certain stone tablet in hastings during the general election campaign by my right hon friend the member for doncaster north ed miliband that stone may have be consign to history but know that my right hon friend will be back very soon to unveil some new green energy infrastructure and that it will be long last than the stone although we have often find ourselves at the centre of historical event we have not always feel all of the benefit our road and rail infrastructure be stick in the past we may be similar distance from london as brighton be but our train line take twice as long we lie at the end of the road that have be describe as the least develop in the south east of england as any driver will tell you we have the bad pothole in the country and our water infrastructure be also fail we southern water have lot to answer for in my constituency dump record level of sewage along our coastline from st leonards through hastings to fairlight pett camber sands and winchelsea beach some sewage have even come into people home and garden in my constituency and when the water pipe have fail we have face major flooding in home and the town centre and be leave without water supply for day on end be pleased to see that the water special measure bill which will start to clean up our water industry be part of this king

get bad over the past year people wait long for an ambulance in my constituency than anywhere else in the south east of england and the situation be particularly bad in our village and rural area such as winchelsea where people wait minute on average when have stroke or heart attack that be why this government plan to cut nhs waiting time can not come soon enough as seaside destination our area have benefit hugely from tourism but we be also at the sharp end of the housing crisis with spiral rent and simply not enough home be build too many of my constituent be leave in poor quality rental
