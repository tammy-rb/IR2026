welcome the move the government have make on this bill it be important that they have do so but they could still go much far pay tribute to the work of the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge on the all party parliamentary group for whistleblowing and to the organisation in this sector that do so much to bring light to what can be very complex and detailed issue the minister talk about the uk have reputation for allow legitimate business to thrive but we be here this evening to challenge the other reputation that have build up over the year the uk have now become hub for dirty money which be funnel through the uk financial system by an army of enabler this bill be an opportunity to dam that flow and to stop this dirty money but as the excellent catch if you can gap in the register of overseas entities report publish by the london school of economics and cage warwick say there be no point build dam halfway across river without close the loophole and the gap that be what this government be do the minister have promise consultation and further thing to come in the future it be fine to dangle these thing before we but we all know that we be head towards an election and the government can not promise to deliver on any of the consultation he hop to bring forward whatever happen there will be an election this house be almost out of time and we should take the opportunity tonight to do this bill right will run through the lords amendment give the time constraint you mention mr deputy speaker the lords amendment on nominee shareholder be table by lord vaux and as other member have say there be an awful lot more we could do on that it be not enough for the government just to say as they do in their letter to member that such measure would most likely be ignore by illegitimate actor and would be difficult to enforce that be not much of reason not to legislate and not to try there be real issue with how complex structure have be bring about and the government need to grab hold of it this bill be an opportunity to close loophole before it be far exploit enforcement be big part of this and the government do not enforce the current rule say measure would be difficult to enforce when they be not enforce the rule to begin with do not give we great confidence between and only three fine be issue for false filing to companies house as of october only one fine of have be issue for not file the person with significant control of scottish limited partnership if the government do not enforce the rule they have bring forward they can not really ask for more rule they need to get real about enforcement they need to make sure the law we pass this evening be effective update to the register of overseas entity be significant gap in the system as other have say update can take almost an entire year in which time other thing could happen event drive update would hold company to account if we think about it there will be paperwork when company make any change so they might as well do the update at the same time that would be logical lord amendment in the name of lord agnew on the transparency of trust datum on the register of overseas entity make critical point we must deal with trust without further delay without further consultation and without kick the can further down the road here be the opportunity to do that as transparency international and the bbc show in february trust be be use to hide the ownership of thousand of overseas entity under the current regime they estimate that more than overseas entity on the register about quarter of the total be hide the ownership of roughly property why would the minister not want to close that loophole why would he not want to improve this system right now it be not as though the government be not warn on this they be talk about consult and do more on it but they be warn about this when we have the joint select committee on the draft registration of overseas entities bill in march professor jonathan fisher kc say if be ask to advise on the face of the draft legislation the first thing would say be have you think about set up trust he go on to say might say to someone if you really want to do this technicolor why do you have an offshore company and have the share of the company put in trust and when you set that trust up why do you think about set it up as discretionary trust if it be discretionary trust the beneficiary do not rank as beneficiary in law all they have in law be the right to be consider by the trustee when capital income be distribute so all kind of thing be already identify and very clear to the government have be highlight in evidence and they could have put these piece of evidence into this bill to make sure that we be close the loophole now rather than allow this to spiral yet far it be also very evident that this database need to be accessible to the wide possible group of people because the law enforcement particularly under this government do not have the money expertise or time to go into this in significant detail let highlight some of the scale of the issue we owe great debt of gratitude to graham barrow as researcher into these thing in his own time as companies house geek he say that the use of brass plaque address for company incorporation have increase since lockdown he have do an analysis of two main address be use in shelton street between and the number of incorporation at the one brass plaque address grow by from to similarly the incorporation in wenlock road also grow significantly by those be just two address and the number be increasingly significantly that be due to the loophole that the government have allow and the corporate structure that currently exist we seek further amendment to tighten this and prevent these brass plaque address from be use for hundred and thousand of company there be certainly more the government could be do to ensure that trust do not fall down on this point allow people to register trust in similar way will result in the same issue bim afolami adam afriyie nickie aiken peter aldous lucy allan lee anderson stuart anderson stuart andrew
