tackle problem in rural community such as mine in the fen through our million internal drainage board fund and invest in nature friendly farming which boost climate resilience enhance farming profitability and secure food production three of the uk five bad harvest have be in the last five year and this year be look particularly concern with yield likely to be down and margin for farmer on the brink just last month the bank of england say that extreme weather be now one of the key factor in drive food price inflation could the minister elaborate on what other step the government be take to mitigate food price inflation for consumer my hon friend make very important point of course consumer food price depend on wide range of factor include agrifood import price agricultural price in general domestic labour and manufacturing cost exchange rate productivity and the extreme weather we have be see which inevitably impact growth and livestock feed supply reassure the house that the uk have very resilient food supply chain and as our food security report show it be well equipped to meet these challenge recently visit the dinsdale family farm to talk to the group of hard work dairy farmer who provide milk to the wensleydale creamery to make their famous yorkshire cheese know the minister will join in commend their contribution to british food security and the dinsdale family for their innovative installation of an anaerobic digestion unit which turn slurry into energy could he look at what more can be do to encourage small scale on farm ad unit which not only significantly cut methane emission but significantly cut cost and increase income for our hard work family farmer the right hon gentleman be absolutely right and join he in commend the dinsdale family for the work they do have speak to number of farmer who would very much like to do that of course there be significant cost involve and we be work with farmer to try to get the circular economy that we all want to see the depletion of soil health the risk of disease and climate change threaten our food security for the long term and yet we need biotechnology and science to ensure that we have future in farming would the minister be willing to meet the bioyorkshire project which bring together fera science the university of york askham bryan college and other to ensure we have the research and the translation and scaling of that to protect the future of farming assure my hon friend that have have numerous conversation with lead academic in her great city and would be happy to have further conversation along those line call the chair of the select committee in june the scottish government make very welcome commitment not to pursue deliberate policy of reduce livestock number despite that livestock number in scotland continue to fall and have fall by over year so that across the united kingdom we now risk lose the critical mass we need to maintain the network of abattoir haulier vet and merchant if food security genuinely be national security be now the moment to consider include within the remit of the climate change committee the maintenance of food security the right hon gentleman make an important point we absolutely recognise that food security be national security he be right about the decline in herd size but of course there be other aspect here we have see high productivity and change genetic it be complicated picture but be happy to have further discussion with he on that water company executive accountability what step he be take to help prevent financial reward for water company executive responsible for poor environmental performance what step he be take to increase the accountability of water company executive the previous conservative government quite disgracefully let water boss award themselves more than million in bonus that they do not deserve this government be put stop to that we have ban the payment of unfair bonus and bring in new jail sentence for pollution offence the tory era of profit from pollution be over this weekend for more than hour waste water from toilet sink and drain flood the river lea affect local community and spread to east london include the wetland in stratford and bow thames water continue to dump sewage and waste water in our river at an alarming rate all while company boss pay themselves million in bonus may thank the secretary of state for the work that this government be do to crack down on that appalling practice and ask what he be do to ensure that the british public be not pay for that failure after receive rise water bill what be he do to secure the serious investment that be need for the health of our river my hon friend be great champion for her constituent in east london on this matter as on many other with her support this government have secure record billion to upgrade crumble pipe and build sewage treatment work across the country so that we can cut sewage pollution we have also ringfence customer money so that it can never again be divert away from investment to pay for bonus and dividend while sewage pollution get bad that of course include in the lea valley this summer it be report that the ceo of yorkshire water have receive an extra payment from parent company in spite of recent admission that it would not be appropriate to receive bonus due to the company poor performance yorkshire water have commit to improve transparency but that be of little comfort to my constituent who be face high bill do the secretary of state agree that it be wrong that those water boss receive financial reward when my constituent be face high bill and shocking performance as my hon friend rightly say that payment have outraged customer and have ask ofwat to assess its legality as matter of urgency will not tolerate any company attempt to circumvent this government ban on unfair bonus through exorbitant salary increase secret bonus payment through parent company or any other deception if ofwat find that the rule have be break company will face sanction include fine impose at level that will deter future abuse state own scottish water be responsible for the water supply across scotland last week thousand of resident in the scottish borders be leave without water for day and terrible communication by scottish water make matter bad we be face public health crisis as well as an animal welfare crisis do the secretary of state agree that the scottish government should undertake full investigation into what happen and ensure that scottish water executive be hold to account for their failure to act congratulate the hon gentleman on raise that important issue and agree with the point he make the snp government in scotland should be take much tough line against such situation as it be not acceptable level of pollution in england be bad enough but under the snp in scotland they be even bad and the snp government should be fully order let we carry on call mr joshua reynolds the public will have be pleased to hear recently about the bonus ban for water company boss but they would have be equally surprised to hear that water company boss in england be award massive pay increase to million with the public being tell that that be not bonus but two year long incentive plan what further step can the secretary of state put in place to ensure that water company be play fair when those be the tactic that they use to circumvent the rule the hon gentleman raise an important point which have be raise in the house before that scheme be put in place and relate to year when the conservative party be in government that scheme would not be allow today household water bills what step he be take to protect household from significant water bill increase customer be hit with outrageous bill increase last year as direct result of the previous government failure to ensure that water and sewage pipe be properly maintain over the long term they deliberately impose light touch approach to regulation that let the system crumble while investment funding be divert to line water boss pocket leave customer to pay the price our powerful new regulator will get grip on the sector and ensure the regular maintenance of pipe so that hard work british family be never again leave to pay the price of under investment and weak regulation in derby the propose water bill increase of about will hit people really hard over the next five year it be bitter pill to swallow because at the same time as hike bill shareholder dividend be be increase and water company continue to pollute our waterway what assurance can the secretary of state give my constituent that our government will tackle such hypocrisy head on and crucially protect our resident from the water bill increase my hon friend be right to advocate so strongly for his constituent in derby at time when they be experience the cost of living crisis as other be thank he for his support in block the unfair multimillion pound bonus that be previously pay to water boss by ensure that customer money be spend on upgrade the water system rather than allow it to be divert to bonus and dividend he be help to ensure that the bill hike that result from tory failure will never happen again unbelievably the secretary of state have just double down in the house on the falsehood that he advance on july on channel news that pollution level be bad in scotland than they be in england be sure that the secretary of state do not want to mislead the house will he take the opportunity to correct the record order falsehood be not word we would use be sure more constructive wording could be use thank you for your guidance mr speaker the secretary of state have inadvertently advance the same argument that he do on july on channel news will he clarify that pollution level under publicly own scottish water be substantially well than those under privately own english water company will he recognise that scottish bill payer pay low bill and that scottish water borrowing be sustainable and consistent with the value and quality of scotland water the hon gentleman be show why the problem persist if the snp do not recognise the problem there be no way that it can fix it have publish the datum and stand by it pollution under the snp in scotland be even bad than it be under the tories in england he should be thoroughly ashamed of what he be do to the beautiful countryside of the country that he represent call the shadow minister the future of thames water be in sharp focus again affect million of people and potentially the wide uk taxpayer bizarrely the third party along the benches to my left lead legal action that could have sink the company reform uk be also happy for the company to go under expose taxpayer to cost of billion and push consumer water bill through the roof this labour government in the passing of the water special measures act repeatedly block our conservative amendment that would have enable limit to be place on the amount of money that can be borrow by water company as we reach precipice with thames water and give the cunliffe review clear call for improved financial responsibility will the government rethink their approach and adopt sensible measure to put water company on more stable and secure financial footing to protect water the environment and the british taxpayer the reason that thames be in the state that it be in be the weak so call light touch regulation that the conservatives impose on the water company when they should have be get grip the point beyond that that the hon gentleman make be sensible one however and our reform to water regulation and indeed to the regulator be intend to ensure that such problem can not happen again in the case of thames we be of course keep very close eye on what be go on with that company at the moment it remain viable but we be ready for all eventuality should they occur moorland protection what step his department be take to help protect moorland the department for environment food and rural affairs work with other to protect moorland by restore peatland manage graze and reduce practice that in some case can be harmful such as burn those step make peatland wetter to help reduce the impact of wildfire we be review the exist protection and will announce the next step shortly devastating wildfire have be rag on the north york moor between scarborough and whitby cover about square mile it be huge fire be sure that the minister will want to join in commend the incredible bravery of our firefighter as well as the tireless service of farmer water tanker driver gamekeeper landowner and all the other volunteer will the minister provide reassurance that he will look carefully at proposal to limit control burning and to change the prohibition of burn on peat over cm deep to peat over cm deep in the light of this year record number of uncontrolle fire include the one on langdale moor thank my hon friend for her powerful contribution join she in express sympathy for all those who have be affect and thank all those involve in fight those fire this be cross governmental issue wildfire and fire and rescue service be the responsibility of the ministry of housing communities and local government but my hon friend will be aware that we have be consult on end locational burn to improve moorland resilience to wildfire we know that restore peatland with diverse plant specie prevent the over dominance of heather and molinia which dry out peat and increase the risk of fire frankly recent wildfire show just how degrade our peatland have become join the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume in pay tribute to the firefighter farmer gamekeeper and everybody who have take part in fight the moorland fire in north yorkshire just over the border from my constituency do the minister agree about the huge importance of manage moorland manage burning of moorland not only improve the ecological status of the moorland but reduce the threat of wildfire absolutely agree with the hon gentleman and that be why the consultation have be take place these be complicated issue and sometimes controversial but we all want to get those moorland into state where we be not subject to these dreadful fire call the shadow minister the thank of conservative members go out to all the emergency service our mighty farmer and gamekeeper who have be consistently fight the horrendous blaze on the north york moor the secretary of state be currently push dangerous proposal to ban vital conservation and land management measure through eliminate the use of control burning of heather on moorland which manage fuel load and help to prevent out of control fire do the minister now recognise that if the government burn ban and deep peat change go ahead they will be responsible for more uncontrollable and far more damaging wildfire that negatively impact wildlife our precious peatland and rural business no do not agree with the shadow minister have choose my word carefully this be complicated set of issue we be consult and we will be come back with our proposal shortly dorset coast pollution what step he be take to help tackle water pollution on the dorset coast my hon friend show the scale of pollution on the dorset coast and share his determination to put stop to it this government be fix the break sewage pipe that be responsible for this pollution fund by billion of private investment that we have help to secure over the next five year that will fund wessex water in his area to cut storm overflow spill by major milestone towards clean up for good beautiful place in his constituency which have the pleasure of visit with he such as bournemouth beach and hengistbury thank the secretary of state for his answer and for his two visit to bournemouth people still talk happily about his visit to the hengistbury head outdoors centre meet recently with constituent in bournemouth east who be call for nationalisation as way to improve accountability and investment in the water industry how do the secretary of state see path towards nationalisation sit within his wide effort to protect our water nationalisation be not the answer because it would require handing over more than billion to water company owner that could only be raise through high taxation or cut to vital public service it would also take year of legal wrangling that would see the brake slam on investment cause pollution to get bad and ultimately lead to high bill for customer this government be take the fast possible route towards clean water and fairer bill we in north dorset would love to be talk about ministerial visit from the defra team but despite an invitation to the farming minister none have cross the border to visit north dorset farmer and landowner wish to play their active and full part to ensure that through nitrate neutrality and other farming mechanism they be improve water quality to help the river that flow to the coast of bournemouth christchurch poole and so on will the secretary of state ensure that body such as the environment agency and other that advise our farmer provide consistent advice in timely fashion in order to maximise their enthusiasm adjournment debate require have enjoy visit milton abbas on many very happy occasion agree with the point that the hon gentleman make we be work with farmer and landowner to ensure that they be get the support they need to take the kind of action that he talk about the new regional tier propose by sir jon cunliffe will give place where farming and land manager can raise their voice and ensure that the outcome they can contribute to be deliver bathing water pollution what progress he have make on reduce pollution in bathing water we have introduce new era of accountability we be reset reform and revolutionise the water sector put public health and the environment first and deliver the change rightly demand by the british people with the most ambitious target on sewage water pollution in history we will halve sewage water pollution by over the summer we see the announcement of million investment into southport waste water treatment work to reduce the number of sewage overflow to just three per bathing season allow southport to once again become the jewel in the crown of the north west coast do the minister agree that that level of investment be very much need after more than decade of tory neglect of our waterway and that it show the difference town can see when it have labour mp labour council labour metro mayor and labour government here in westminster minister that be tough one unsurprisingly could not agree more thank my hon friend for his work to champion his community here in parliament the previous government oversaw record level of sewage pollution in our river lake and sea but this government have secure billion of private investment to upgrade crumble pipe and halve sewage pollution by so that community can once again take pride in their river lake and sea as have remind ministers on number of occasion tackle pollution in our river and sea require we to address agricultural pollution as well as sewage pollution be disappointed not to hear the minister mention that but like to come with solution recently visit the wyescapes landscape recovery project in my constituency which be an innovative farmer lead project of farmer protect soil reduce pollution restore nature and produce great quality food will the minister or perhaps her colleague the farming minister come to visit this innovative project to see how we can tackle river pollution and protect nature and food production another adjournment debate need the hon lady raise really important point agricultural pollution be incredibly serious and this government recognise that we have update the defra statutory guidance for the farming rule for water and recently host roundtable with farmer environmental organisation and the water industry to bring the voice of stakeholder to the fore we have commit to include new regional element in the new regulator to ensure great involvement in water planning by move to catchment base model for water system planning we can tackle all source of pollution enter the waterway include agricultural pollution have very keen interest in the river wye go to see it last year and it be absolutely beautiful the hon lady will be well aware of the research project with million of funding that we announce to look into all source of pollution and what we can do to clean up this beautiful place in our country welcome the fact that the rolling reporting of dry day spill have become mandatory under our government but it have unfortunately lay bare the track record of south west water which be among the bad offender on dry day spill what step be the minister take to ensure that company such as south west water feel the full force of the law with regard to dry day spill my hon friend be absolutely right to be angry about the state in which our river lake and sea have be leave and recognise the trouble that fail water company cause for his constituency that be why we have commit to resetting reform and revolutionise the water sector and why we be establish new single and powerful regulator that can fully hold all company to account and ensure that they be deliver for the british people and clean up our waterway for good run off from chicken manure be particular problem in the bathing water and river in shropshire have visit both harper adams university and lohas fertiliser in my constituency which have great new technology to deal with chicken manure stabilise it and move that great fertiliser to other part of the country where it cause few problem however they can not scale up so what step be the minister take to enable the new technology that could deal with some of these problem to be scale up and use across the country the hon lady raise really interesting point it be perhaps worry how interested be get in what we can do with manure and human waste to provide organic fertiliser in our country she have give brilliant example of what can be do and will make sure that the minister who be responsible for the circular economy my hon friend the member for coventry east mary creagh get to hear about it and learn more sustainable farming incentive what step he be take to increase access to the sustainable farming incentive for small and medium sized farm funding for the environmental land management scheme pay to farmer will increase by from million in to billion by sadly though we inherit set of scheme that do not necessarily distribute fund fairly we be work with farmer to reshape the sfi and further information about our reform will be provide shortly like the national farmers union welcome the protection for the agriculture budget in the recent spending review include crucial funding for sustainable farming on visit to farmer in my constituency the difference this be make be clear it be invest in our countryside and support nature base farming however far too many farmer on small and medium sized farm tell that the scheme be far too difficult for they to access at the moment those be exactly the farmer who be also likely to be lock out of private nature base financing option so how can we work with those farmer to reform the scheme and ensure that more of those small and medium sized farm can benefit from this crucial funding my hon friend make an important point and commend he on his interest and his insight he be absolutely right and we be learn from past sfi iteration and from what we be hear from farmer to improve the sfi for all farmer and to ensure we can give well guidance and that everyone can have share of the pie we be also look into new local advice and collaboration offer as well as consider how we can get the good environmental outcome from the money we be spend after the elephant in the room that be the farm destroy family farm tax the no issue that be raise with by mid buckinghamshire farmer not least at the bucks county show last week be the uncertainty over the future of the sfi do not think it be go to cut it with farmer to say that further detail will be provide in due course they need certainty and they need it now so will the minister come to the dispatch box and put firm date on when farm will have that certainty as well as assure they that the new sfi will have food production at its heart the hon gentleman will be pleased to know that we will be make announcement on this very shortly interruption we be pick up disastrous mess inherit from the previous government this be absolutely true who be quite cavalier about the way in which these scheme be run we be have to clear up that mess but absolutely sympathise with farmer who should not have be put in that position in the first place call the liberal democrat spokesperson give the secretary of state love of dorset would love to invite he to mid dorset where goodens farm be do some really innovative thing on very small family farm especially with manure mr randall who run that farm join the sustainable farming incentive last year which enable he to start grow new crop herbal ley because climate change be make farming so tough he be try everything he can to keep his business go the sfi allow he to take that risk but it be no long available to he as he put it we need farm security if we want food security so what step be the minister take to look after farmer on our very small farm who be critical to food production there be lot in that question the hon lady be absolutely right that herbal ley have be very effective and many people have see the impact they have have during the dry weather it be also interesting that these scheme be now available to much small enterprise than they ever be under the previous scheme there be much that can be do and we be redesign the scheme to make they work towards achieve exactly the outcome that the hon lady be seek topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility as we have hear this summer have see wildfire burn across our countryside add my thank to the emergency service who be out in force to battle those fire but so too be farmer gamekeeper and local volunteer who give up their time and resource to control the fire and help put they out pay tribute to all of they for their selfless bravery and community spirit the fire come at the end of long period of drought visit farm this week and early in the summer see for myself how food production have be affect it be clear that further work be require to support farmer to build on farm reservoir and irrigation system that can sustain their business through dry period and have invite the nfu to work with on that want to use this opportunity though to thank farmer for the outstanding work that they do to feed our country through thick and thin as we move into autumn flooding be once again on the mind of resident in rossendale and darwen this government have already make vital commitment to our flood defence but recently some community have express concern that flood modelling be out of date and be either not fully identify risk area or identify risk area as high risk that no long be the environment agency be aware of that so will the secretary of state join in urge it urgently to prioritise new modelling my hon friend make an important and timely point through the flood resilience taskforce we be look at how we can update the modelling to make sure that all area that need protection will get the investment to do it because far too many community be expose to the danger of flooding that be why we be invest billion between and to protect our community and well maintain our flood defence in england call the shadow secretary of state may join the secretary of state and everyone across the chamber in thank the fire service farmer and rural community for their hard work and bravery in tackle the wildfire that we have see this summer be hearten to discover the secretary of state new fondness for farmer we will all be listen carefully to his answer to the next question with of farmer say that they have pause or delay investment because of the budget and with food price rise record farm closure under his watch and labour own think tank admit that the family farm tax need change will he finally do the right thing put rural community above his own ambition and axe the family farm tax first may welcome the shadow secretary of state back to the chamber it be disappointing that she do not bother to turn up for the water statement can only assume that she do not care much about the pollution that her party be responsible for across the country when it come to farming we be work with the farming sector on road map to bring it back to profitability that be the route to ensure that those business remain financially viable and successful into the future it be her government who leave so many farmer on the brink of bankruptcy so it take only small problem to push they over the edge some farm close under the previous government we be work with the sector to make it profitable for the future hate to break it to the secretary of state but suspect have speak to far more farmer than he have in the past month they do not believe word he say because he betray what he say to they before the election about the family farm tax as for this road map if farm continue to close more than half of farmer be think of give up in the next five year because of this government plan it will be road map to nowhere yesterday the governor of the bank of england tell the treasury committee that the rise in food price be due in part to measure in the last budget place high cost on food business in light of that and the terrible summer harvest will the secretary of state do farmer favour for once and rule out new wealth tax on farmland in the next budget yes or no the cause of food price inflation include rise global energy price extreme weather event that have be affect harvest as we have already hear and global supply chain problem include the russian invasion of ukraine those thing be affect food price right across the country as part of the road map we be work with farmer to ensure more supply chain fairness so that the producer of origin get fair share of the money that be make through the system for the food that they grow that be the good way in which we can support farm to get their fair share of the revenue that come in for the food they produce in my constituency producer such as longley farm exemplify british quality its dairy product be globally renowned what specific step be the department take to prioritise the purchase and promotion of british produce ensure support for domestic farmer reduce food mile and strengthen the uk food security and rural economy my hon friend be absolutely right and we should all be proud of high quality british producer like longley farm that be why back in july announce our food strategy which will build pride in british food by ensure we have food system that back british food grow the economy feed the nation nourish individual and protect the planet now and in the future brit chew billion piece of plastic chewing gum each year single piece release thousand of microplastic into the body that be link to cancer diabete and stroke will the government consider commission independent research into the environmental and health implication of plastic chewing gum thank the hon lady for her important question and share her concern about the risk that microplastic may pose to the environment and human health that be why we be look at all source of pollution that enter our river lake and sea but there be obviously more work to be do to improve our understanding the environment agency be collaborate with different sector include the water industry and national highways to increase our evidence base and knowledge of these material may also express my disappointment about the global plastic treaty we be unable to reach an international agreement but reassure all member of the house that the government remain committed to seek global solution to the problem of plastic pollution that we all face erewash industrial base be build on the erewash canal which be now lovely leisure spot for my constituent but abandon boat like the two near sandiacre lock that sit rot for over two year pose serious risk to public safety and local wildlife be very glad to work recently with the canal river

hon friend for his successful championing of this issue on behalf of his constituent know how much it mean to his community to have such boat remove it be an important issue and be more than happy to

berwick in my constituency he tell that he have recently give up raise livestock altogether due to the lack of local abattoir his near option be well over an hour away what action be the government

activity of people smuggle gang contrast our approach with that of the conservative party which leave we with this border crisis and with that of reform which be happy to stoke anger but have absolutely no answer to stop the small boat it be crucial that the labour government provide global leadership to smash the criminal gang can the solicitor general set out the work that we be do with

with the republic of ireland to ensure that that do not happen be more than happy to look at that but the point the hon member make about international co operation be extremely important that be why highlight our groundbreaking deal with france it be deal that the conservatives be unable to do which will be absolutely key to stop people cross the channel call the shadow solicitor general

offender for truly hideous crime go back to from my time as lancashire police commissioner have see the fruit when the police the crown prosecution service and the court work together to prioritise the listing of case involve rape and serious sexual assault as we know that victim and witness be less likely to continue with prosecution the long it continue can the solicitor general update we on the work be do to ensure that those agency work together to support the victim and prioritise those case listing as the hon gentleman will know list be matter for the independent judiciary however can tell he that certain area have pilot scheme of weekly list meeting across criminal justice partner to ensure as he say that we lessen victim attrition which be unfortunately far too high as result of the record court backlog welcome the fact that the backlog of those case will be examine again and that historical case will be look at but one of the challenge be that whistleblower in local authority be sack under non disclosure agreement what advice be the crown prosecution service provide to ensure that those nda be remove so that we can get to the truth of what happen with those

public purse thank the solicitor general for that answer the court system and all the associate it have be leave in the most catastrophic state by the previous conservative government it be shock that billion be spend on civil court it system that can not even handle litigation where there be more than one claimant or defendant which be basic and normal the particular issue that worry today though be the legal aid agency and the state of its it system as she will know it be the subject of cyber attack in the spring could she update we on that situation and on any potential plan to build back well unfortunately my hon friend accurately describe the year of neglect of the justice system under the previous government she ask specifically about the legal aid agency the government take

she agree to meet again with and with representative from the cps to understand the loophole in the law that have identify it would be tragedy for the victim of spike if this be not deal with because of something as frustrating as misunderstanding by people who be not in the room at the time the hon member have do important work in this area we meet previously to discuss the potential for reckless spiking and entirely understand why he be concerned about that the correspondence that we send reflect that we have have discussion with the cps who feel that the circumstance that he be concerned

tackle the disparity between the state and bereaved family at inquest as to timing know that everyone be work extremely hard to get the legislation right the government hope to be in position to introduce bill to parliament very soon international law compliance what step she be take to help ensure that the uk uphold international law the hon member will appreciate that as law officer can not talk about the specific of legal advice to government however he will be aware of paragraph of the ministerial code that acknowledge the overarching duty on all minister to comply with the law that obligation be inherent in all the advice that the law officer give to government by the end of september more than gazans be project to face catastrophic food insecurity while the integrate food

that my right hon friend the chancellor will deliver her budget statement on wednesday november call the shadow leader of the house thank you madam deputy speaker hope you and everyone in this chamber have very good summer break with just the right proportion of sun sleep and family if may let start with double round of congratulation first to the prime minister on his birthday this week put he squarely in the prime of life and secondly to my brilliant colleague my hon friend the member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont who have just be appoint to the giddy height of shadow deputy leader of the house that be the reshuffle that really matter as befit former lawyer at freshfields he will bring his forensic intellect to scrutinise the government have be plan to talk about the government performance over the summer take into account the escalate union demand for pay the rise in inflation unemployment and gilt yield and the record number of small boat crossing in the first half of the year think it be fair to say that the past few week have be total shamble for the government little wonder that the prime minister have undertake yet another of his performative government reset to distract the medium and the general public he insist that everything be absolutely fine which be doubtless why it be all be change round yet again they can not blame these thing on the previous government though doubtless the leader of the house will try there can however be only one topic today and that be tax in the real world it seem that those of we poor soul who actually do pay tax be about to be confront with massive tax raise budget perhaps with particular focus it have be rumour in the medium or kite have be fly on property taxis last year the chancellor increase spending by billion fund half of that through taxis and half through increase borrowing of course it seem that the only person who will not be pay more tax be the deputy prime minister like and rather admire the deputy prime minister uniquely among the government she at least have policy of try to reduce taxis we just hear the solicitor general talk about government take strict line on fraud do not hear so much about take strict line on tax or potential tax fraud but we now have situation in which the deputy prime have try to dodge pay in tax on her third home after demand that previous ministers should resign over tax scandal it appear that she fail even to look at his majesty revenue and customs guidance on the internet as to whether high rate stamp duty be payable that guidance be readily available and be straightforward it be hard to imagine that any qualified tax adviser let alone any individual seek to question their own tax arrangement would not have take look or know about it the deputy prime minister sign deed for what appear to be an off the shelf trust scheme from shoosmiths the solicitor be that craft to avoid tax we need to know more about what disclosure she make to the civil service about her three home what review be carry out and what advice she be offer hope the prime minister adviser will look at those issue in addition to all the other issue he be look at do the leader of the house believe that cabinet ministers let alone the deputy prime minister of this country should be use scheme to dodge tax should the secretary of state responsible for housing be flip her own main residence to avoid pay tax due on it do she concede that there be the appearance of very serious impropriety about these proceeding do she see how difficult they have make the situation for her colleague the chancellor of the exchequer who be plan to put budget in front of this house that will include tax raise measure many of which will likely be focus on property above all labour and every labour member stand by this make solemn commitment to maintain the high standard in office in its own general election manifesto do the leader of the house accept that this conduct by the deputy prime minister massively fall short of that and that it discredit both the prime minister and the government as whole call the leader of the house welcome back to you madam deputy speaker and all the house staff join the shadow leader of the house in wish the prime minister happy birthday for early this week this summer have be mark by some happy personal event here in

british steel job seize and crush dangerous off road vehicle finally recriminalise shoplifting ensure that bus be affordable and serve their community and protect our much love football club we be take on the vested interest that hold this country back and we still have much more to do in the rest of this session in contrast the conservative really have show on whose side they stand in this session on the side of landlord against the renters rights bill on the side of criminal gang in vote against our border security asylum and immigration bill for the few not the many in education and as ever die in ditch to save the hereditary peer in the other place we know whose side they be on the shadow leader of the house choose to have another go on the issue of tax and property which be notice the subject of one of the conservatives opposition day debate yesterday they could not muster enough speaker for that debate to go the full three hour so he be have another go today repeat that the deputy prime minister have give full account of her family circumstance and living arrangement she make it clear that she be now rectify her mistake she have refer herself to the independent adviser on ministerial standard who be now look into it will not say any more on that matter because he be look into it suffice it to say that the deputy prime minister be huge huge asset to this government she be an incredibly effective minister and she have be deliver whether on our record investment in social housing the flagship employment rights bill the big settlement for local government in many year major planning reform to get more home build or the delivery of devolution and community empowerment among much more the conservatives have go at she because she be so bloody good at her job yet again the shadow leader of the house come here and talk about the economy and the budget but another year have go by and we have still have no apology from he or his front bench colleague for the state they leave the country finance in let we just remind ourselves about that they leave huge black hole in public spending high level of debt and borrowing and living standard that have for the first time in history fall during parliament he be always very selective in his use of statistic he do not mention that the british economy have grow fast than all other country in the first half of this year or that mortgage be now at five year low after decade and half of poor productivity because of lack of investment we be now power up this country and invest in the new job of the future around the country with job come every day the chancellor will set out the budget in the usual way but she have make clear that most of the speculation be quite honestly damaging rubbish let we not forget that we be now come up to the three year anniversary of the disastrous liz truss mini budget think remember that the shadow leader of the house be the financial secretary to the treasury at that budget when government lose confidence and take irresponsible decision the poor in society pay the heavy price when the economy crash we will take absolutely no lecture from the conservatives the shadow leader of the house want to talk about the performance of the government over the summer but he do not let we be honest the leader of the opposition do not need reset but full blow resuscitation her party spend most of the summer check whether she have pulse or not the truth be that her leadership like the future of the conservative party be quite frankly at death door the snp lead glasgow city council be propose to introduce car tax on east renfrewshire motorist so that every time my constituent enter glasgow city they would have to pay fee could she make time for debate on the enormous level of waste by the snp government on thing like barlinnie prison which be time over budget or the ferry that go nowhere so that we can tell the snp to stop waste our money and get out of the pocket of east renfrewshire motorist know what an issue parking charge can be in city centre such as my own my hon friend be right that would make really good topic for debate let

substantive step to end the appalling situation in gaza agree to ceasefire and commit to long term sustainable peace that deadline be fast approach the un general assembly convene in less than week

have its final roll out to provide childcare for work parent which be what they need and deserve this conservative policy will save parent year per child also welcome the extension of the holiday activity and food programme after its long term future have remain unclear for many month it be fantastic to see how enthusiastic the education minister be about the plan remind the house that only two year ago when we announce our childcare policy the policy that be have their final roll out announce now the secretary of state for education herself label our childcare plan break and total mess only one year ago she refuse to commit to roll out our childcare plan altogether so be grateful for the change of heart and that she have put party politic aside to deliver the support that work parent need our child should always come first we welcome the expansion of childcare but the announcement mean little when the industry itself be crumble as result of the action take by this labour government most notably the damaging job tax early this week lead organisation represent child parent and childcare provider write to the education secretary call for urgent action follow the hike in national insurance contribution without such action the sector have warn that it will not be able to provide the final roll out of childcare with one in childcare provider say that they will face closure within the next two year without help leave the sector at risk of collapse the early education and childcare coalition state that the hike in national insurance have create perfect storm leave many provider in position where offer childcare be simply unviable instead of listen to the expert and organisation task with look after our child the department shameful response be to label the claim as lie and utter nonsense how disrespectful to parent child and the childcare sector what be utter nonsense be the fact that the minister expect childcare provider to absorb the national insurance increase without the financial support need while keep fee the same we need to be clear it be not just the sector that will be punish because of the minister lack of coherent planning hard work parent and their child across the country will suffer too will the minister outline what engagement he have have with the sector to ensure that provider be not force to shut their door or reduce the hour they provide will he finally admit how damaging the job tax have be to the childcare sector and what the impact and cost will be will he update the house on the impact of the job tax on childcare provision and how he will continue to monitor its impact on the detail of the minister announcement will he clarify how the department be identify the most disadvantaged area and how he plan to make the big impact will he put parent up and down the country at ease and confirm that the chancellor will not fill she billion black hole with the education budget while we welcome the expansion of childcare the reality be that labour decision be make childcare less accessible and more expensive the education secretary say she be stand up for hard work parent but they be the one who will suffer as result of this labour government our child will suffer too it be time for she to stop make broken promise and to ensure that early year provision be her no priority start by welcome the shadow minister to his place on the opposition front bench but it be shocking that even now the conservatives can not bring themselves to recognise the significance of labour childcare expansion nor can they celebrate the new school base nursery that make more affordable childcare place available across the country despite the conservatives scaremongere nine in parent have one of their first choice childcare place this labour government inherit pledge without plan but once again we be deliver for family give parent more choice and set child up with the good start in life the people of this country be well aware of what happen when conservative member make pledge ahead of election such as new hospital or level up and of the reality that liz truss crash pension and mortgage what do conservative member do they cheer she on let spell it out to they and tell they truth that the british public be keen to ensure that the conservatives hear at the election last year when they will not even take the blame for the thing that they do they certainly will not get the credit for the thing that they do not do over year they dismantle the support for family more than sure start centre which boost early learning provide healthcare and build community be rip away from community across our country it be no wonder that the conservatives do not want to admit that what we be rebuild they destroy this government be deliver on our promise of change thousand of new nursery place expand childcare hour best start breakfast club in every primary school across our country and support throughout the school holiday labour be deliver on our promise to parent we be save family thousand of pound give parent work choice and improve child life chance that be what the country expect and that be what be proud this labour government be deliver call the chair of the education committee welcome the minister statement the expansion of funded childcare hour this week the future expansion of school base nursery and confirmation of further three year of funding for the holiday activity and food programme my committee be today launch an inquiry on the early year we will examine in detail the government work in this area look at the sustainability of the workforce family access to service across the country and the quality of outcome for child may therefore ask the minister what additional work he believe be need to ensure that child in family who be not in work who often have the most to gain from high quality early year education be not leave behind by the expansion of funded hour for work family how confident be he that the significant problem in recruitment and retention of early year practitioner will be address to secure the workforce need to deliver on the government commitment finally will the minister join in pay tribute to everyone in my constituency and across the country who have spend the past six week run holiday activity and food programme know they be utterly exhaust this week but they should know that their hard work have help to tackle poverty and disadvantage and to provide vital opportunity that keep child and young people safe and help they to thrive the chair of the select committee be real champion for maintain nursery across the country and know that she share the government vision of ensure that every child get the good start in life and have the chance to succeed and thrive as she know we set out our vision for early education in our landmark strategy in july look forward to receive formal notice of her committee inquiry and to work with she and the committee in constructive manner put the need of child and young people first pay tribute to all those who work over the summer to deliver for child and young people as former playworker see the huge value of the haf programme commend all those who work so hard over the summer holiday call the liberal democrat spokesperson high quality early year education be the well possible investment we can make in our future whether we be serious about tackle the send crisis or the attainment gap or be simply concerned to give every child the good start in life proper investment in the early year be one of the strong lever we have we all know that for far too long the previous conservative government neglect the early year sector leave legacy of sky high fee and childcare desert in their wake particularly in disadvantaged area we liberal democrats therefore welcome the government announcement of more school base nursery alongside the extension of fund childcare hour but let we not forget the deep problem face the private and voluntary sector without address the massive financial strain on those nursery and childcare provider we can never hope to deliver for family their survival be absolutely central to support family up and down the country to thrive the government job tax be afraid have only add fuel to the fire the financial pressure of underfunded hour the national insurance contribution rise and inflation have leave many provider on the brink indeed some nursery be already tell parent that they may be unable to sign the new contract due to financial pressure early this week in letter publish by the early years alliance survey of more than provider find that could not meet demand this september while one in six have already cut funded place that be couple with crisis in recruitment and training of staff in the sector if the provider and the staff be not there how can the minister expect his expansion to deliver for parent up and down the country will the minister commit to urgently review the funding rate so that they reflect the real cost of deliver high quality early education at the same time will he work with his colleague in the department for business and trade to ensure that we extend and fully fund parental right so that familie up and down the country have real choice between whether they want to stay at home for long period in the early month or go out to work full time thank the hon lady for welcome our expansion of childcare note again that nine in parent receive one of their first choice childcare place we be determined that our childcare expansion will deliver safe quality care for child know that the whole house agree that the safety and wellbeing of child be of paramount importance

laying of two report before this house that completely undermine the linkage between the ombudsman and this place and as say at the start it undermine our opportunity and decision to look at any information that we deem to be of importance or that matter to we in order to allow we to advance policy the motion be very simple one if approve it will compel the commissioner to lay before the house the report that they have undertake with regard to the complaint of miss and mr have table the motion as chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee which be responsible for the phso we will look at those report and advise accordingly if necessary make no prior judgment of whether the phso or the charity commission have get it right in this instance because we have not see the report however it fundamentally undermine the right and privilege of this place and all of we as members when we be prevent from see report that have be produce follow due diligence and proper investigation and inquiry by statutory body and the ombudsman who be servant of the house because there be concern which share that the charity commission have act perversely in bring legal proceeding that would prevent the laying of the report the second part of the motion seek to refer that action to the committee of privileges so that it can take look in the general scheme of thing this may seem very small element of parliamentary life but the court have hitherto always take the standpoint that parliament can and should see what it want and need to see and that the court should take no role in interfere with or obstruct that channel of communication we be all familiar with mr speaker give advice from the chair about the sub judice rule for example but it do not mean that we can not talk about thing we do so know full well that privilege entail both right and responsibility hope the house be with we on this matter which be important it be time for we to robustly reassert our right under the idea of privilege and have access to information remain to be convince that the charity commission have act advisedly in bring the action even yesterday the commission try to put pressure on to withdraw the motion believe still that it be in the right decide not to do so and think it be an abuse of the commission to ask we to do that the public administration and constitutional affairs committee will undertake an inquiry on arm length body of which the commission be part and number of right hon and hon member from across the house have privately raise with concern about decision that the commission be take it be appear to do so in slightly abstract or perverse way without any degree of accountability that matter be separate from this motion but it be important for all our arm length body and particularly the charity commission to understand that this house will not be bully by arm length body seek recourse to the court to stop we do our job properly efficiently and professionally on behalf of all our constituent it be an honour to follow my hon friend the member for north dorset simon hoare the chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee and thank he for be so generous in leave so much time for other to speak we absolutely support the motion that he have bring before the house we be deeply concerned that anyone least of all public body should be seek to prevent the parliamentary commissioner for administration from lay report before this house as my hon friend have set out with admirable clarity we have long stand and absolute right to be able to gather and examine relevant information for our inquiry and our work the linkage between the ombudsman and the house be well establish and long standing and nothing should impede it legal proceeding should not be seek to prevent the laying of report before this house so we strongly support that this house should reassert its ancient right to request and require paper and evidence be grateful to the hon member for north dorset simon hoare for bring forward this matter as well as for speak so powerfully and so concisely on the issue and to mr speaker for grant debate on this important principle the government recognise and value the critical role that parliament play in scrutinise our work should the house agree to the motion the government will await the work of the committee of privileges with interest question put and agree to house of lords hereditary peers bill programme no motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the follow provision shall apply to the house of lords hereditary peers bill for the purpose of supplement the order of october house of lords hereditary peers bill programme consideration of lords amendments proceeding on consideration of lords amendments shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion three hour after their commencement the lords amendments shall be consider in the following order and subsequent stage any further message from the lords may be consider forthwith without any question be put proceeding on any further message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their mcmorrin question agree to house of lords hereditary peers bill consideration of lords amendment king consent signify clause exclusion of remain hereditary peer beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment to and this house send the second chamber bill that have simple and direct objective outline in this government manifesto but have to report to the house that something very strange have happen since then people say that the conservatives be in some sort of hibernation since the general election but it would appear they have find an issue that have awaken they from their slumber on the order of their whip some hundred of conservative politician finally muster the strength to make their mark in parliament and ready to take action for what the conservative party believe in have find their crusade what be it keep hereditary lords in the job they access by accident of birth have to say that it be tale as old as time the tories block progress who know it this be an opportune moment for to mention my summer reading list and the first labour government in even at that time there be talk about reform of the house of lords so this be very much tale as old as time itself in fact look back in historical hansard it go much far back than so be it not good that this labour government be finally get on with deal with it my hon friend be absolutely right whether we go back to or even far back and will during my speech we find conservative in this house protect their friend bear into position of power this bill will finally remove such an archaic right just as the hon member for clacton nigel farage he be overseas at the moment understand want to send people certainly in wales back down the coalmine the leader of the opposition be stick in the politic of the past before turn to the amendment send back from the other place want to draw attention to comment make by the noble lord strathclyde he say of this bill that inevitably there will be repercussion they the government be store up huge problem for themselves the conservatives have not only complain that the government be remove hereditary peer while offer nothing in return more sinisterly they have threaten to use delay tactic on this government agenda we only have to look at their behaviour in debate in the upper house to see that they have be try to hold the government hostage on the football governance bill the employment rights bill and the renters right bill all to protect the hereditary principle we know that the conservative party be in no fit state to take action on very much but where be their energy be direct at present it be be direct at the self preservation of hereditary peer in the house of lords that be unacceptable and frankly it deserve to be highlight as say the bill have return to the house amend by the other place most of the amendment serve to undermine the core purpose of the bill or go well beyond the bill intend remit lord amendment have to be read with its consequential amendment lords amendment it seek to end the system of hereditary peer by election while retain the current cohort of hereditary peer the government can not endorse those amendment which fundamentally undermine the core purpose of the bill the government have manifesto commitment to bring about an immediate reform by remove the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords lord amendment would allow exist hereditary peer the young of whom be to remain in the other place for decade to come that therefore block an immediate reform the minister will be aware that the reason hereditarie still sit in the house of lords be the deal do in the promise make by the then labour government be that hereditarie would remain until the house of lords be properly reform the minister be aware that he be remove the hereditarie but give no assurance about when full reform of the house of lords will take place what assurance can he give this chamber about when the government will make proper proposal to reform the upper chamber as the leader of the house of lords have set out in the other place immediately this bill be on the statute book select committee will be create to look at those issue of retirement and participation the hon gentleman be talk about politic as they stand in this government be elect on manifesto that deliver mp in and this government be follow that manifesto across both this house and the other place there have be broad consensus that the hereditary route to the house of lords should end also make it clear as ministers have from this dispatch box and labour peer have in the other place that this be not judgment on individual it be not judgment on the work and contribution of individual hereditary peer it be judgment on the principle let also say that there be no barrier to any hereditary peer in the case of the conservative party through party list be nominate as life peer should the leader of the opposition for example wish to do that the hon member for harlow chris vince mention the very long period of time that his party have be anxious for and agitate about reform of the house of lords be the creation of future select committee really the sum of all that anger and agitation as my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox have say we could have see full picture of modernised reform and accountable house of lords that work to deliver bicameral scrutiny but we do not have that the minister be ask we to vest hope in the creation of select committee with no timeframe attach to when it would report and no promise of future legislation surely he must be as disappointed and unhappy with that situation as be it be great to see that the hon gentleman be disappoint that house of lords reform be not go far enough if he want to talk about the century and the length of time that his party be in power would say that it have every opportunity to bring about full reform of the house of lords not only do the conservatives bring about minimal reform at good but they block every attempt at major reform it be difficult therefore to take their position seriously the point about the select committee be that we have have on the one hand accusation that the government be act in party political way and on the other request for the government to do thing cross party that be precisely what the select committee will do it will give the opportunity to consider issue such as retirement age and participation the debate in the upper house cover those matter across different party the select committee will be establish within three month of royal assent the hon gentleman ask about deadline and can tell he that the committee will issue its finding by next summer for one be perplexed we have hear opposition member say that they want we to go fast and far in reform the house of lords and we have hear they chuntere about the divine right of whoever and whatever in that place do the minister agree that the opposition seem to be rather confused about this which perhaps stand as testament to the ability of the leader of the opposition to lead her party the word confused sum up the opposition whether on this bill or any other do not purport to speak on behalf of my party but rather as an individual who have long have an interest in the positive role that the lords play in revise legislation which any elected and strongly whip house would not be able to do the minister partly anticipate the point want to make when he mention the ability to appoint some of what would otherwise be outgo hereditary peer to life peerage that may be way forward for people of good will to pursue but give the quite high number of people who find themselves in quite responsible position in the lords what sort of number do he have in mind to allow the party that will lose large number of hereditary peer to appoint as life peer the right hon gentleman always make an individual contribution to his great credit not only in this debate but in other will not be draw on number which be always matter for the prime minister and the usual channel as in every parliament the leader of the opposition of whatever party will have the opportunity to nominate be sure the right hon gentleman will make persuasive case to she about some member of the upper house do not expect the minister to be specific about number but can he at least tell the house whether he accept the principle that considerably large one off tranche would be need to cater for this unique situation there will be the usual period in this parliament when there will be an opportunity and repeat that there be no barrier to someone who serve as hereditary peer be appoint as life peer opposition members seem to want lot of reassurance for the people who feel they be bear to rule can the minister tell what reassurance the government can give my constituent and young people in kinson and west howe that they will have equal right to be part of this legislative body my hon friend be absolutely right she speak powerfully about her constituent and want my constituent in blaenavon pontypool and cwmbran to be able to aspire to be member of parliament include in the upper house and that place be not reserve for people through accident of the shadow minister chunter from sedentary position if he be in favour of the hereditary position let he tell we instead of hide behind the smokescreen of pretend he be in favour of full reform let we hear he say from the dispatch box that he believe in the hereditary principle if he do we have say from the outset that we want this bill on the statute book before turn to the next phase of reform delay this legislation mean delay the establishment of the select committee and delay further reform as my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince mention the reality be that since we last reform the lords the outside world have change our parliament should always be place where talent be recognise and merit count it should never be gallery of old boy network nor place where title many of which be hand out century ago hold veto power over the will of the people do the minister recognise the irony that give these issue be discuss in we be probably now discuss the hereditary peer who be the grandchild of the hereditary peer they be talk about get rid of year ago my hon friend be right one would think that the debate about bloodline and pedigree as basis for participation would no long have any advocate but it appear that number of such advocate be leave century later from the parliament act to the house of lords act the history of lords reform be litter with example of individual member strain every sinew and make every different argument to try to resist reform in lord curzon coin the term the unionist peer who be to fight into the last ditch over the then parliament bill and whose effort have act as an effective block on further change today ditcher all sit on the opposition benches will the minister give way will give way to hear from one of the ditcher guarantee to the minister that as council estate boy from lewisham be not someone who ever think that my bloodline would get into the house of one day want to challenge the minister about the point he have make about future reform his party have majority of and we know that it win the general election why be he claim that we be try to block reform which be completely untrue while the government be so lacking in ambition and do not have the courage or political will to bring full package of reform to the house which the opposition might well support what we be ask be why he be tinker at the edge and then attack we for not be in favour of reform when he have refuse to bring reform in the first place in respect of the hon gentleman bloodline get to the house of lords be sure it be only matter of time before we see that in term of the antic of the opposition do not know whether the conservative parliamentary party in the commons speak to peer but it should talk to they about their behaviour on the bill and other bills that they have block and block and block understand that the leader of the opposition be apparently spend time to come up with credible policy no one will believe that the conservative party be in favour of wholesale reform of the house of lords it have be more than year since parliament agree to end the hereditary route with supposedly temporary arrangement to retain hereditary peer it be almost year since the great reform act which take away the hold of the great aristocratic family open up the franchise and take their presence in electoral politic from monopoly to anomaly nonetheless the hereditary principle remain in our parliament sometimes as symbol of tradition sometimes as obstacle to real reform as conservative peer have recently demonstrate there be real opportunity today for the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster he have protest several time about newly find passion for wholesale lords reform no have be glad to hear that there be the real voice of the conservative party we have also therefore hear lot of protestation that there be no attempt from the conservative party to block this we will see in the voting lobby in due course whether the conservatives actually seek to block further progress again we talk about history and nostalgia but this have in real sense be use in the upper house to block bills with democratic mandate since last year for the completeness of history it be year since the labour party promise to abolish the house of lords and think we will be wait another before it even get close to that the minister be absolutely right that the public can not stand the hereditarie it be something they be bitterly opposed to but they be also oppose to prime ministerial patronage it be almost as unpopular as the house of lords now new peer have go into the house of lords since labour come to power and the guardian have report that dozen more be set to follow be we just go to be replace the old nobility with new labour nobility absolutely not because the prime minister of the united kingdom be member of parliament who enjoy the confidence of this house that be entirely different from the situation of have place in the house of lords on the basis of an accident of birth should say though because do not want to just criticise the conservative party today that do appreciate that should the hereditary lords finally be give leave the title of the most ancient and outdated relic will then be award to the modern day conservative party so guess self preservation be the conservatives real motive the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes speak about our majority we will not allow the conservative party to block this change if the hereditary principle be so wrong where do that leave the principle of an hereditary monarchy which have infinitely more influence than any hereditary peer we have modern constitutional monarchy that enjoy very wide popular support it be completely different matter do not think monarch have block an act of parliament since queen anne in so would say that the monarchy play very different role in our constitution from that of the hereditary peer in the house of lords the government be determined to deliver this reform to rectify this historic wrong and move we close to fair more equitable parliament therefore urge the house to reject lords amendment and do need to deal with other amendment now lord amendment would prohibit future unpaid ministers from be eligible for membership of the house of lords understand the strength of feeling express in the debate on this amendment in the other place and should make it clear that be proud of the work of all ministers across government know that ministerial colleague in the other place work incredibly hard in this house both ministers and shadow ministers be able to focus on our departmental portfolio with the honourable exception of the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster who as far as can make out seem to be about third of the shadow cabinet with his various role in fairness he carry out his public duty as ever with great dedication in fact the situation that the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster find himself in be quite regular in the house of lords where front bencher cover number of different portfolio which they do with skill and dedication however have to say that although understand the motive behind this amendment it would do little to address the problem it seek to resolve it would not result in all current lords ministers receive salary and would instead mean that the number of lords ministers would in future be reduce ministerial salary be determine by the ministerial and other salaries act which set maximum of ministerial post across both houses and the house of commons disqualification act which limit the number of ministers in the house of commons pay or unpaid to the reality be that any meaningful change to the number of ministers or ministerial salary would have to amend that legislation it be for the prime minister of the day to advise the sovereign on the appointment dismissal and acceptance of resignation of other ministers in line with those legislative limit the amendment would therefore have the effect of place further restriction on that prerogative power and reduce the ability of the prime minister to choose the good people to serve in their government the bill should clearly not be use as vehicle to address change to those act and therefore urge the house to reject lords amendment lord amendment would create new form of statutory life peerage and seek to create two tier peerage system that distinguish between the honour of peerage and membership of the house of lords under this system individual could receive the title of peerage but not be entitle to sit and vote in the house of lords wonder whether the minister could help out because feel that might be have dream about some strange alternative reality where the hill that the modern conservative party be prepared to die on be give unelected peer who be no long peer the name and title lord as if that be the most important issue of the day in can he help be that actually what be happen be awake or not at this point can help the hon gentleman out on one issue can reassure he that he be most definitely awake this be most definitely reality where be afraid will fail be in explain the priority on the conservative benches the hon gentleman be quite right to draw attention to that thank the minister genuinely for give way again he be courteous and gentlemanly in do so promise that this will be my last intervention could just ask he about the difference between the problem he be discuss and what the bill will enact where hereditary peer be not give membership of the house of lords but be still give the title and privilege of be peer of the realm quite simply the amendment be try to create the title as an honour without the actual membership that be the difference have an exchange early about there be no barrier to life peerage that be not say no barrier to the title the life peerage if grant obviously confer both the title and the participation that be the difference between the two on the point about the amendment be unnecessary as my noble friend baroness anderson of stoke on trent state in the other member hear hear family connection exist on the government benches as well the uk already have an extensive and long stand honours system which recognise and promote the outstanding contribution make by individual the length and breadth of the country and from all section of society as have be say be appoint as peer be an honour but it also bring the responsibility to contribute to the work of the second chamber the government have manifesto commitment to introduce participation requirement to ensure that all peer contribute to the work of the other place an approach that have receive widespread support from peer certainly do not think that create another layer to that system to provide for the statutory creation of non sit peer be in keep with the mood of either house therefore urge the house to reject lords amendment turn finally to an issue on which hope there will be cross party consensus which be resignation by power of attorney lord amendment and would allow the house of lords to set out arrangement for resignation from the other place where peer lack capacity include when someone be act under lasting power of attorney during the passage of the bill in the other place it become clear that there be considerable support to address in legislation the long stand concern that member who lack capacity be unable to resign from the house of lords and the government have listen and act follow discussion with peer across the house of lords the leader of the house of lords bring forward these amendment to address the matter what they make clear be that notice to resign from the other place may be give and sign by person act on behalf of peer who lack capacity provide that it be do in accordance with the standing orders of the house the amendment relate to resignation would come into force on royal assent to ensure that family who wish to avail themselves of these new arrangement do not have to wait until the end of parliamentary session to do so it seek to provide certainty to peer who have raise this issue it be solution that have receive unanimous cross party support in the other place and hope that the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster will confirm the support for that amendment this short and focus bill it deliver on manifesto commitment to immediately remove the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords it be not personal and nor be it comment on the contribution that hereditary peer have make the government be grateful for their service in the other place and stress again that there be no bar on they return as life peer if their party leader wish to nominate they however the time have now come to deliver this immediate reform so that we can move on to further reform of the other place as set out in our manifesto and deliver on what be promise in july last year therefore urge the house to support the government position call the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster it be pleasure to debate this historic piece of legislation on an historic day my hon friend the member for windsor jack rankin remind that it be the anniversary of athelstan be crown king at kingston and know there be great many celebration go on there today the monarchy live on even if his majesty government be make change to our ancient parliament the paymaster general accuse the conservatives of have be in hibernation but it must be the paymaster general who have be in hibernation for he seem to have forget the fact that we be fight desperate rearguard action against the disastrous decision that his government have make against the enormous damage that his party have do to our country in the short month it have be in power and the bad budget that we have see in very long time which have cause year borrowing to be at high rate than it ever be under the previous government or indeed the government before it be truly terrible state of affair and economic expert say that we be head towards an economic crash it be already cost job in the constituency of all the hon gentleman across the chamber every month it be serious issue one that this opposition call out at the budget and will continue to call out hope that the government see sense before disaster strike before move on to the specific of the bill want to pay tribute to the quality of debate first in this chamber at the outset of the legislation and then the sheer quality of debate in the lords it reflect just how significant our upper house be to our constitution in its ability to strengthen legislation through scrutiny particularly want to pay tribute to my noble friend lord true who have do so much to hold the government to account as they have push these measure through the paymaster general have talk about the conservatives seek to block legislation in the lords be absolutely delighted that we have be try to block their terrible legislation and be very pleased that the lords have send the bill back with number of improve amendment that speak of the decent scrutiny that be be do in the other place agree with the paymaster general at the outset that we accept the government concession on power of attorney it be sensible change and be glad that there be at least one issue on which we can find agreement we be pleased that during the course of the debate the labour party have make number of significant and historic clarification to its position it seem finally that the labour party have agree that an elect upper house would be bad idea personally welcome that think an elect upper chamber would totally disrupt the balance of our constitution it would take away from the primacy of this house and often lead to constitutional deadlock it have take the labour party about year to reach that conclusion but welcome it join the side of right be also very pleased that gordon brown disastrous plan for constitutional reform which be publish during the last parliament have be do away with they would have cause utter mayhem have they be push through by this government so commend those on the front bench for kick gordon brown terrible idea into touch be pleased to see that the government have renege on their manifesto commitment to kick out peer who be over it be terrible idea and be very pleased that they have see good sense there be lot of excellent peer who be over such as lord dubs and by the end of this parliament lord blunkett lord clarke and lord heseltine people who have add to the richness of the house who bring their experience and who should not be bar on the ground of age congratulate the labour government on have admit their terrible mistake turn now to lords amendment the house of lords have understandably introduce an amendment that would keep the exist hereditary peer in place we have hear already from my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox how the labour party have renege on the deal that it strike in the late that be go to keep small number of hereditary peer in place until such time as it bring forward comprehensive constitutional reform package which this clearly be not this be fascinating return to the like much about the conservative party but think the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have miss the fact that there be an election last year in which the labour party clearly win mandate to deliver the removal of hereditary peer what may or may not have be discuss in the be for the bird there be an election we win that election we say we be go to do this let get on with it fully accept that the labour party have change its mind but in do so it have renege on the deal that it strike in the late let we be clear about what be happen the labour government be now seek to remove whole group of public servant who have do nothing wrong will the hon member give way sit down those public servant be in the lords because the last labour government put they there as part of the deal that it strike on long term constitutional change obviously declare an interest as my wife be member of the house of lords and salaried minister for good fortune the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster recognise that the labour party win an election but be talk about deal that go back far do he not realise that he risk undermine the salisbury addison convention which say that manifesto commitment should pass through the other place without hindrance know that the hon gentleman aspire to be back in government one day do he not recognise that by do down that convention he risk his own future legislative programme should the conservatives ever get back into power in future the hon gentleman will understand that this legislation be not be block but improve that be what parliament do and that be how the process of scrutiny work he will see very clearly that the amendment make significant improvement to the faulty legislation that his party bring forward thank the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for his indulgence he say that lords amendment make significant improvement to the bill why then when it be bring forward in the other place by lord grocott as private member bill and in this place by david now lord hanson do the conservatives block it and say that it be terrible idea do not recall we say that it be terrible idea distinctly remember many conservative peer speak in favour of it actually but that be part of the joy of the independence of the upper house which as will shortly explain risk be undermine by this legislation what the government be now try to do be remove group of public servant who have do nothing wrong and who have simply serve their country and continue to do so the reason they be be remove be very clear the government can not rely on their vote consequently they be attempt to take group of opponent out of parliament by act of parliament this be simply cromwellian be not suggest that the prime minister be second cromwell cromwell be great man brave bad man as clarendon say while the prime minister be just man do not believe that the government have cromwellian intent they be do something clumsy and foolish but mean this seriously what they be do will set precedent do not believe it be route that the paymaster general would follow but the people who come after he may be much more like cromwell than he interruption there be laughter from behind the paymaster general but want we to think seriously about what future parliament might look like if the precedent be set that political opponent can be remove by act of parliament someone in the future even if maybe not tomorrow in two year or in year will point back to this guarantee it it do not need to happen this way we have group of people already in the house of lords and already do job take viscount stansgate who be an excellent member of the house of lords and deputy speaker as be sure hon member know there be hereditary peer who sit on parliamentary committees so this change will be enormously and unnecessarily disruptive to the working of the house it would be much well to leave they in place and let they do their job on that point think of peer such as patrick courtown the opposition deputy chief whip who have serve in the other house since in number of ministerial capacity that be because of where he be bear but there be risk in see member laugh about rich and privileged hereditary peer this be not downton abbey any more and many of these people have give their life to this parliament do my hon friend agree that should the government get their way this afternoon there need to be an urgent conversation about support for those hereditary peer who may suffer after lose their position in the other house the minister raise his eyebrow but many peer in that house be not stately home owner but people who have give their life and position to this parliament and they will need support go forward be interested in my hon friend excellent point and hope the minister will respond to that in his closing remark what we will see be the removal of group of public servant to make way for labour placeman and labour stooge huge act of patronage do not think anybody here believe that will improve scrutiny it be just number game it be simply an attempt to give the government more compliant majority in the house of lords which they do not need the government will be able to get their business through the house of lords anyway so this be an unnecessary change that despite the comment of the paymaster general belittle the contribution of the peer who already sit it belittle their service and it do not need to be do turn to lords amendment on pay be interested by the paymaster general response and listen closely to the detail he set out there be an important principle here we ask people to serve as ministers of the crown and think most of our constituent would agree that those ministers should be pay member of the house of lords be on no salary they can collect their day if they turn up but let we assume that one such member be an unpaid minister in the home office they will find that on many work day they will be expect to travel perhaps to northern ireland scotland or the north of england and they will not be able to collect their allowance on top of that for take on that important unpaid job they will also for understandable reason have to give up their outside interest that mean simply that many people in the house of lords can afford to take ministerial job only if they be already of considerable mean just do not think that the paymaster general in his heart of heart want to see the perpetuation of that if he do not agree with the lords amendment will he confirm whether the government intend to bring forward comprehensive plan on that will correct the paymaster general on one small point of fact he say that if ministers in the house of lords be pay we would need to reduce the number of ministers in the house of lords as only certain number of ministers can be pay rise will let the paymaster general intervene if he want to provide clarity on that technical point it be consequence of the interaction between the exist statute and this statute be not argue for that be say that that would be the effect of the lords amendment with the amendment what the government could do be reduce the number of pay ministers in the commons and have more pay ministers in the lords that would be possible under the lords amendment do the shadow minister honestly think that could go back to my constituent in lichfield burntwood and the village and say that by support the amendment as he be encourage to do there would be more ministers from the other place and few from the commons how do he think that would go down on doorstep have be punch in the face and it be not great be not sure whether his voter would be that impressed by the ministers in the commons at the moment to be honest the point of principle still stand if somebody be minister of the crown it be perfectly reasonable that they should be pay for do that job would be interested to know what the government plan be to right that wrong finally on lords amendment which cover new status of peer it be unfortunate to hear some hon member belittle the idea include the sleepy dreamy hon member for maidenhead mr reynolds from the liberal democrats hon member dreamy appreciate how that come out madam deputy speaker and do not if the shadow minister wish to correct the record please feel free laughter well do know he look like he have make an effort today and he be look at in particular sort of way there be suggestion that everyone be bust gut to create new status of peerage when it be unnecessary let we put it this way think lot of people in our country recognise that get peerage be one of the high recognition for service to the country but there be also good many people whom come across when be minister deal with the honours process who be either late in age in their or or infirm and would not want to commit to serve on the red benches because of that it seem bit silly that such small change should deny they the opportunity of recognition which cost no one anything but enable we to reward good people who have do the right thing by their country do the shadow minister think that the order of the garter the order of the thistle and the order of the british empire be not sufficient to recognise such people the house of lords should be work chamber shape our public life the hon gentleman make good point there be other type of honour but we already have peer who have stand down and they get to keep their title they be call member of the lords but do not sit in the lords so the disjuncture already exist interruption would the paymaster general mind pass the water have get terrible throat we already have peerage that work the other way round we be suggest that it ought to be possible for somebody who be perhaps in advanced year or not well to accept peerage without feel that they be under an obligation to go and sit on the red benches that be perfectly reasonable request rise go on one more time thank the shadow minister for give way to for third time presume what he be suggest be more about the title and the style than about seat in the legislature he will know that under the royal warrant that grant the justice of the supreme court the style and title of lord that do not come with any connection whatsoever to the legislature so there be way of do what he suggest that do not require the lords amendment it can be do via royal warrant through an order in council the hon gentleman be very well informed and he be exactly right this amendment as be discuss in the lords would add clarity to the process and mean that it would become more routine than occasional in that however he be entirely right will conclude by say that good amendment have be send back by their lordships amendment that improve this bill in more way than one and which would keep the considerable skill and expertise of the hereditary peer on the red benches for little time long they would not prevent the labour government from bring in more peer if they want to and they also raise important question about ministerial pay and how we use our title be very pleased that we have reach common ground on the issue of advocate power and look forward to hear the minister response lord amendment seek to gradually reduce to zero the number of excepted hereditary peer in the other place by end the election by which they be replace our rich constitutional democracy have benefit from century of gradual evolution and our democracy have thrive because power be not concentrate in the hand of too few people which have mitigate the risk of overreach even though frustration be frequently express our parliamentary system be rightly admire around the world several current excepted hereditary peer reside in my constituency along with other excepted hereditary peer they make valuable contribution and be motivate by public service when stand for election to this place and promise would campaign for local job be not think about the hereditary peer of mid derbyshire necessarily but here we be today reform of the house of lords have be on the agenda for very long time and there be broad consensus that it should happen indeed it be tell that the last conservative government do not seek to undo the reform make by the previous labour government in from its origin in the century the house of lords have undergo numerous change include period when the lords spiritual be remove between and and the year during which the other place be abolish altogether from until the restoration of the monarchy in more change follow include when legislation be pass in to create life peerage for people with specific skill and expertise to enhance our democratic process and that include admit woman for the first time that spirit of reform be further by the last labour government in when the number of hereditary peer be limit to free seat for people with range of different experience and expertise regardless of their lineage the principle of the reform the government be push through today be not necessarily controversial and lords amendment do not seek to block the principle of end the involvement of excepted hereditary peer instead it ask for the conclusion of their participation to be undertake more gradually and believe there be some small merit in what that amendment seek to do have be lucky to work with some exceptional excepted hereditary peer on joint committees and all party parliamentary group to end their involvement at the end of the session rather than perhaps at the end of the parliament risk destabilise some of the good work that be ongoing through some of those parliamentary vehicle will the minister therefore explain in his sum up whether he have consider different way of manage that transition for instance we could seek to end the involvement of the excepted hereditary peer at the end of this parliament rather than just ahead of the next king speech that might ensure that the professional relationship we have foster with our colleague in the other place and the piece of work we conduct together with they continue to be fruitful conclude with natural cadence at the end of the parliament although know the bill have be tightly draft to deal with the role of excepted hereditary peer only the government have plan for wide constitutional reform of the house of lords which may come before we at later stage warmly welcome the government commitment to introduce participation requirement it be not right that people should use the other place as social club or facility that they can use it be work chamber and people should be in there do the job to which they have be appoint the government have also say that they seek to replace the house of lords with an alternative second chamber that be more representative of the region and nation even though it be key that the other place represent the rich social and geographical diversity of the united kingdom it be also essential that the house of commons remain the principal forum where issue be consider through the lens of locality the house of lords certainly since the introduction of life peerage in the have be vehicle to include the voice and perspective of expert across wide range of field rather than focus on locality encourage my colleague to reflect before introduce such fundamental change to that relationship the manifesto that the government and be elect on include commitment to introduce mandatory retirement from the house of lords at the age of would welcome clarification from the dispatch box as to whether that remain the case although it be necessary to get more young voice into the house of lords to enhance its ability to represent and serve the nation the proposal that peer should retire at would mean we would lose the contribution of lord kinnock who be lord dubs who be and baroness beckett who be give peerage by this government age peer may reach their birthday while work on piece of essential legislation or lead committee the house could therefore benefit from further clarity if we be to pursue this about how mandatory retirement age could affect disruption to business and risk lose essential knowledge and expertise will the minister also share any information either in his sum up or in the very near future about how the government plan for constitutional reform see the future of the lords spiritual one of whom be also my constituent in any further shake up of the other place my advice to the government as they rightly seek to make the house of lords more representative and effective be that they should tread carefully to avoid unintended consequence our precious democracy deserve no less call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats welcome the bill as first step to give the house of lords great democratic mandate and entrench its valuable role within the constitution and legislature of the united kingdom our democracy rely on parliament that equally represent all citizen of the united kingdom and that be why the abolition of hereditary privilege in our second chamber be long stand policy of the liberal democrats we have call for this reform for decade and be pleased that the government be take step to address this issue for too long parliament second chamber have lack the democratic mandate that would give it real impact within our legislature inherit membership of the lords only weaken our democratic institution and decrease public trust in our system furthermore it reinforce the gender imbalance in the second chamber as note in previous debate on this bill not single one of the hereditary peer currently sit in the lords be woman actually be take quick look around and think be the only woman here so it fall to that be apart from madam deputy speaker beg your pardon it fall to to underline how important the democratic role of woman in both our houses of parliament be also note that this reform be not about invalidate our tradition nor discredit the contribution of many hereditary peer over previous decade it be about improve democracy and restore public trust in politic by make parliament more representative many hereditary peer have expertise and skill that they have give to our political system and to our legislative process as turn to today lords amendment it be disappointing yet perhaps unsurprise that after year of delay and resistance from successive conservative government they continue to resist meaningful electoral reform their propose amendment would only water down the bill or waste further time prolong the existence of flawed system therefore wish to speak against lords amendment which would dilute the bill and continue the system of hereditary peer instead of meaningful reform it opt for an underwhelming ban on by election for hereditary peerage in practice that would have the effect of leave all current hereditary peer in place indefinitely thus continue this antique system for many year to come for year cross party effort have attempt to end the by election system for hereditary peer despite successive conservative governments resist this vital reform now there be an opportunity to end the entire system of hereditary peerage and the conservatives once again continue to resist change the bill and the amendment be consider today highlight that the will of parliament be to end the hereditary system in the lords there have be enough delay it be time to be decisive and to end hereditary peerage in entirety here and now we have the will the power and the mean to end this anomaly before we today there be no need for the amendment also wish to speak against lords amendment as outline by lord true conservative government appoint unsalaried ministers and whips be in the lords at the end of the previous parliament and commons library research confirm that since there have be at least unsalaried ministers and whips in the lords today the very same party that appoint they seek to champion the end of such appointment as if they have not have the power to effect this change themselves on many occasion over the past decade draw member attention to the point eloquently raise by my excellent colleague the lord wallace of saltaire in the other place regard potential anomaly that the amendment could allow want to focus on lord true who in introduce the amendment in the other place say that it would not apply to any exist member but only to future ministerial appointment in the lords give that all hereditary peer be current member of the lords fail to understand what relevance the amendment have to the legislation in front of we unusually happen to agree with lord true that all minister should be properly remunerate but struggle to understand why piece of legislation that aim to scrap the principle of hereditary peer be the appropriate vehicle to enshrine that point the lord true speak movingly of his shame and anger at be unable to provide remuneration to his fellow conservative during the last parliament be not sure completely sympathise remuneration of lords ministers be an issue for another occasion liberal democrats believe that the solution to the issue of democratic accountability and proper remuneration of our ministers do not lie in this poorly draft amendment instead we must push for wholesale reform of the house of lords and our democratic system more widely include devolve power so that the decision that affect people life be make close to the place where they be put into effect we therefore urge member to reject the amendment and instead work with the liberal democrats to introduce proper reform of the house of lords and give it the democratic mandate it need also wish to speak against lords amendment when the bill come to the house it represent an opportunity for first step towards meaningful reform of the second chamber that be why originally table new clause which would have commit the government to future legislation on reform the second chamber and new clause which would have increase transparency in the second chamber by strengthen the power of the house of lords appointments commission however the conservatives have demonstrate no interest in strengthen or improve our democratic and legislative institution instead their amendment create yet another type of peerage it be an unnecessary amendment that do nothing to strengthen democracy or transparency since lords amendment before we specifically call for new type of peerage it follow that it be not relevant to legislation that specifically and exclusively deal with the legacy of hereditary peer if the conservatives have proposal that could meaningfully improve our second chamber they should support liberal democrat call for further reform of the house of lords look forward to their support for our call to change the opaque appointment process for peer and to reduce the inflated size of our second chamber if the government could update we today on their proposal for legislation for further reform of the house of lords then the conservatives could put forward their proposal for new category of peerage this house should look to be ambitious on political reform of the second chamber they should not look to expand democratically flawed system with time waste amendment the liberal democrats will therefore be vote to reject this amendment we welcome lords amendment and which be modest but important change that will improve how the house of lords function the amendment aim to support those peer who may lack capacity to fulfil their duty last power of attorney have be effective in support individual freedom and dignity and it be only right that peer be not exclude from those freedom we welcome those amendment and will support their introduction into this legislation return to the bill as whole liberal democrats welcome its aim however we be concerned that by pass this bill the government will believe that their effort can end here let be clear this bill be welcome step towards well democracy but it should not be the final step the burns report recommend decrease in the size of our second chamber which the liberal democrats support the process of prime ministerial appointment entrench patronage and elitism within our politic and the liberal democrats support move away from that system labour own manifesto commit to retirement age for peer another change that we would support there continue to be so many opportunity to improve the functioning of our democratic institution the government should now look into those further measure include what be the most overdue and important change when it come to the lords finally give it proper democratic mandate urge hon and right hon member to oppose lords amendment and which would water down the bill the liberal democrats will support this once in generation opportunity to fix part of our broken political system and use it to strengthen democracy in our parliament and begin rebuild trust in our politic lord amendment fly in the face of the intention of the government and this house to immediately reform the house of lords by remove the last peer who sit in parliament base solely on their bloodline entitlement start with the premise that the last hereditary peer sit in the other place as result of compromise in when more than hereditary peer be remove take the view that the other place and indeed this parliament be no less effective as result the very architect of that compromise the marquess of salisbury say himself that the arrangement be suppose to last for around six month the final have have an effective notice period of year already notice period that any worker in the real economy would no doubt welcome it be now time to complete this reform for those seek to support the amendment ask where have you be one of my predecessor as mp for telford my right hon friend the noble lord grocott have continue to campaign on this issue for decade and have be vindicate at long last he propose exactly the measure outline in the amendment end the by election to phase out hereditary peer in four private member bills over the last year each and every bill be block by conservative peer and conservative governments so do not believe that this amendment have be table in good faith instead the opposition be clutch at straw to prevent progress because they fear change in recent speech on the bill the noble lord grocott use the word gestate to describe the reform he try to introduce over the last year or so that be the right word the opponent of these change know in the that they have lose the argument and that the good they could do be to slow down the inevitable bog down reform with procedure and compromise agree with lord grocott that almost year of gestation be far too long for anyone this government decision to finally lance the boil and remove the remain hereditary peer be long overdue but it should be no surprise whatsoever that we face exactly the same kind of resistance now that our predecessor face year ago first the conservatives try to defeat the bill when that fail they try to compromise back then it be well just keep few hereditary peer phase they out so the change be too sudden now they say you must keep the hereditary peer phase they out so the change be too sudden somehow what be only ever intend as an interim solution be be replace by another interim solution we have have year to phase out the hereditary peer and they be still there frankly the remain hereditary peer have have year of borrow time in fact we have hear from tory hereditary peer about the repercussion for this bill threat that they will use obstruction and delay to get what they want if that sound familiar to the house that be because in that be exactly the same threat make to the then government and the then parliament the marquess of salisbury say my whole tactic be to make their flesh creep we must resist this fearmongering these underhand tactic this opposition at all cost to the democratic process those who have table lords amendment might say well unlike the last compromise this one will eventually see hereditary peer leave the other place but when they have already delay the inevitable by year will we have to wait another or year the youngest sit hereditary peer be just year of age wish he long and happy life of course do and if he survive to the age of the old sit hereditary peer which be that would be another year until the end of the interim solution that be agree year ago that be general election from now telford constituent bear the day the bill become law the day we start phase out hereditary peer would be year old by the time the last hereditary peer retire that be enough time for that constituent to have retire from this house themselves my hon friend be make an excellent point the work that lord grocott do on this in the other place be commendable but it be sadly block time and again by the conservatives on my hon friend point about the young hereditary peer and the number of general election that may have pass before he will have see himself out by no long be member of the house of lords he would regain his right to vote and stand in general election so if he wish to return to parliament there would be plenty of place in this house that he could try for my hon friend make valid point point that have be make by other member include from the opposition benches be that there be nothing stop the leader of the opposition put forward any hereditary peer for life peerage the hon gentleman say that the leader of the opposition could give those peerage but he will be aware that that be organise through the usual channel in conjunction with the prime minister and member of the govern party we would be lot more comfortable talk about the replacement of hereditary peer if the minister have come with any clarity on the condition that may be set go forward but we have have none of that challenge the minister to say that hereditary peer can be put in as life peer we would like some more information on what we be get the hon gentleman make an interesting point this be about priority and choice the leader of the opposition will be able to nominate people this year and next year and maybe the year after if she be still in place she can make decision on whether to put forward hereditary peer or someone else during that spell be sorry to intervene again but this be an important point since the general election there have be nominee to the other place that would have count for half the entire hereditary peerage group of the conservative party have the leader of the opposition take the opportunity to promote they to life peerage by not do so the conservatives have choose to keep those hereditary peer out the leader of the opposition have number of tough choice ahead of she and those choice will no doubt be execute use her good political judgment to conclude to right hon and hon member from different side of the chamber who say that we need more reform of parliament the house of lords the constitution and the way in which the country work say as moderniser and the mp for an area for which the current system do not work that could not agree more but this modest change this slender bill have take around hour in this place and in the other place with more than amendment table so imagine how large and more far reach bill would be treat as the minister have state many member from across the political spectrum in the other place have call for cross party approach and that be exactly what the government be do through the establishment of select committee let close on this thought we have hear for many decade the promise of future reform support and will vote with the government today on the basis that those future reform will come through hope that the government will be true to their word and constituent like mine who have see themselves lock out of this place for far too long will have the opportunity to serve it well here we be again the house of commons and the house of lords love debate reform of the lords we have be do it for over year but we have make bit of progress at least after all this time we seem finally to have kill off the idea that the house of lords should be elect that be great step forward and congratulate the minister on his wisdom in realise that that would just replicate the sort of system that they have in washington and make it virtually impossible to have coherent government say well do think that we should give credit where it be due the poor old liberals have be dream about reform with election for year but be afraid that it be not go to happen will though take issue with the minister for be bit cruel about the conservative party when he accuse we of have be relentlessly negative for all these year he seem to have forget that in the we have hear about the conservative party lead the debate on make the house of lords genuine parliament of the commonwealth and very innovative idea be come out of the conservative party he blame the conservatives for endlessly block reform but it be actually the unholy alliance of michael foot and enoch powell during the wilson year that block the last real attempt at house of lords reform the father of the house mention conservative party policy in the and maybe he can recall well than but do not believe there be any mention of house of lords reform in the conservative party general election manifesto last year will he illuminate the house on conservative policy on reform the other place our policy be very sensible gradual evolution and reform that be what the conservative party be all about this be an historic day and it be rather sad one after the crown the house of lords be the most ancient part of parliament and the hereditary peer be the most ancient part of the house of lords chamber one can laugh at history and say this be all old hat but history be important this all evolve from the magnum concilium or great council of england the come together of england into single realm be through the witan assemble by the king comprise noble and prelate bishop abbot ealdorman and thegn come from across the land it be not just their privilege but their feudal duty it be all about duty to give the king counsel and consent it slowly evolve so that some peer sit in parliament by their office such as the bishop of lincoln or by their hereditary title such as the earl of arundel repeat this point can not understand the contempt and hatred for people just because they have their office by virtue of heredity the hereditary peer be the only people in the house of lords who be actually elect by anybody this be not about individual it be about the principle do the father of the house agree that it be the principle we should be talk about today not the individual however good they may be at serve in the other place frankly do not agree with that principle as say in an intervention on the minister this will leave the monarchy wholly expose as the only person who hold his office by reason of hereditary principle will the father of the house give way will make bit of progress know the minister will say that the monarchy be popular which it be and that it do not have political power but it have infinitely more influence than any hereditary peer do not think we should accept that the hereditary principle be entirely wrong even if we accept that and say it be quite wrong that somebody should be call an hereditary peer which suspect be lot of the problem why do we not just make all the exist hereditary peer who as we have hear be not stately home owner they be dedicate public servant with score of they have work in parliament for year life peer give that they be dedicate public servant if we hate the fact that they be call hereditary peer why not have an evolutionary form and call they life peer but we be not do that lord amendment table by my party in the other place be entirely sensible rather than kick people out in flash the hereditary peer which we could now call life peer if it be the name that make people unhappy could simply fade away there be lot of merit in old people gradually fade away rather than die declare an interest do not declare an interest in sense that be already the case as the lords have suspend hereditary peer by election by amend the standing orders of their chamber evolution rather than revolution bend instead of breaking be the usual method of british constitutional change it have work very well in the past and do not see why it should not work now it be far wise than overnight change there be also the matter of optic and fairness this of course be partisan point by its very nature but of the remain hereditary peer be member of opposition party conservative or be independent cross benchers and two be totally non affiliated briton pride themselves on the spirit of fair play it be not frankly cricket for govern party to expel opposition members from the national legislature as lord strathclyde point out if any other country be do this expel member of parliament primarily because they be from opposition party we would be launch petition against it thank the father of the house for give way he make compelling point about other country would he care to name some other country that have people sit in their legislature able to introduce and vote on legislation entirely by dint of their parentage for the life of can not think of many example of course nothing in our constitution be perfect we would not be start here we accept that we be just say that this be group of dedicated public servant who have do nothing wrong and we be simply ask that they should be allow to carry on their work rather than be kick out primarily because they be from opposition party will the father of the house give way no the hon gentleman be very good chap but he have have lot of turn we all know that the real reason behind all of this be that the government want to make space for more of their donor and crony to enter the house of lords and that be entirely understandable by the way think that there be sensible reform that could be make in the house of lords and that there have be lot of abuse think that too many people have be appoint to the house of lords this be where the snp have good point who be donor and crony we could have start by give real power to the house of lords appointments commission which should look not simply at people propriety but at their suitability we hear criticism of some newly appoint member of the house of lords who be very young think the appointments commission could consider the attribute of any aspire candidate and ensure that the new membership of the house of lords be take from the most distinguished part of the nation it may be fair point for another reform that perhaps we should not have people appoint for life we have hear of somebody who be or young perhaps we should say that if someone be appoint to the house of lords they should serve for only year or retire in that parliament there be always argument about age but agree with my hon friend the shadow minister and be glad we get rid of the ageist principle there be nothing wrong with people over the age of or indeed in their they be just as useful indeed lot of people in their and do brilliant job and some people in their or be completely useless not of course in this chamber think have make my point commend the father of the house for everything he be say he sum everything up perfectly this be constitutional vandalism and it be destroy the continuity that have make this place so effective and so special for so many century this be clearly be do with political motivation which think be thoroughly wrong if we make constitutional reform at very least the british people should have say in referendum well the whip be look at he want to sit down my hon friend have make the point brilliantly and shall now sit down rise to speak to all the lords amendment but will go into more detail on lords amendment and be pleased that the bill be make progress and look forward to see it on the statute book as soon as possible we be one step close to fulfil yet another manifesto pledge welcome lords amendment and for the reason already set out they will allow members of the other place who lose capacity to retire with the dignity that they deserve it be clearly sensitive and complex problem and congratulate the government on find solution that receive unanimous cross party support in the other place hope it will receive the same cross party unanimous support in this place today we have already discuss lords amendment and which propose to stop hereditary peer by election and stop any vacancy be fill although they would still allow current hereditary peer to stay in the lords allow their number to grow small and small as they gradually begin to leave if pass the amendment would leave the current crop of hereditary peer in the second chamber for year and year indeed in some case as we have hear for decade but the entire purpose of the bill be to remove they immediately because of the principle that underpin our decision to make this change count great many hereditary peer among my friend and know that they do excellent job however britain stand alongside lesotho as complete anomaly in the century by preserve legislative role base on lineage serve in this house as in any other be privilege of the high order do the hon gentleman agree that our legislator should be there on the basis of merit rather than dna congratulate the hon lady for have so many friend in the other place could not agree with she more it be almost as if she have read my speech and hence make she timely intervention if the hon gentleman agree that the hereditary principle be wrong and that no one should be in this parliament by dint of dna surely he be say that we should abolish the monarchy the crown be part of this parliament and royal assent be part of the legislative process if we go by his principle the hon gentleman be basically say that the monarchy itself be no long relevant be that what he be say all would say be long live the king what we do with our hereditary peer today do not affect what we do with our monarchy as be say no one should serve in the other place and make our law simply because of the family that they be bear into no one should not they not not my child and not theirs that be basic principle that hope we can all get behind the hon gentleman case in essence be that the only form of legitimacy in the exercise of power be democratic legitimacy but that do not square with the exercise of power in all kind of other way do it we do not elect our judge some country do but we do not we do not elect all kind of people who exercise fundamental power many kind of legitimacy be not democratic legitimacy surely he acknowledge that have the government come forward with proposal that allow the hereditary peerage to wither on the vine it would be hard for anyone in the house to disagree give that the government have manifesto commitment the principle be talk about applie specifically to the two chambers that make and scrutinise our law submit amendment and so on the idea that some people should be allow say in that process because of the family they be bear into be alien to the house of lords should have be abolish year ago be glad that the government be finally take the step to remove that principle be certain that decent argument can be make for the contribution of hereditary peer be good one often with the nuance and expertise that come with dedicated service in the other place have no doubt that we will hear such argument today but the same be true of those who be appoint as life peer at least when political party fulfil their responsibility and choose appropriate people for the role life peer too will go on to make excellent contribution and scrutinise our law carefully use their relevant expertise and knowledge give that they be often select because of their expertise and knowledge and not in the cynical way that the shadow front bench and other be suggest early even if they do not it be life appointment not one base on blood that they can pass down to the next generation so think that the system of life peerage be the well way to go if opposition members genuinely believe that the hereditary peer who will lose their place because of this legislation should still be in the other place they can ensure that the leader of the opposition whoever that be submit their name to make they life peer the hon gentleman make the point extremely well and think that people with mind to compromise would like to go down that road but do he recognise that the usual handful of allocation will not be enough on this one off occasion to meet the requirement that he have so ably outline more than position be available already and as time go on more will become available it will be up to the leader of the opposition to make that decision do my hon friend agree that the labour party manifesto state clearly that we will abolish hereditary peer be we not to do so the people of this country would simply be bewilder my hon friend make the point extremely well have have to deal with this on number of issue include introduce vat on private school for example where member come to this place argue the point and say that we have no right to do it yet it be in our manifesto so we have moral obligation to pass this legislation hope that opposition members will join we in the lobby as we do so interruption the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart chunter from sedentary position but be more than happy to take an intervention if he wish to make one if the hon gentleman believe that the labour party have moral obligation to implement every part of its manifesto how do he feel about the bit that it have already ditch the labour party have moral obligation to fulfil our manifesto pledge and be confident that during our five year term we will make great progress on everything that we set out in that document have argue that lords amendment undermine the core purpose of the bill and be entirely inconsistent with our commitment to remove hereditary peer from the other place lord amendment be an attempt to ensure that in future all minister who sit in the house of lords be pay salary have read lords hansard know that this be well intentione amendment and can see why the lords have submit it however ministerial salary be determine by the ministerial and other salaries act so any proposal to change they should be make through amendment to that act rather than through this bill this bill be specific narrow and focused if we want to have conversation about those salary we need to allocate far more time to that and consider separate legislation so will not be support lords amendment have to do quite bit of read around the subject to understand lords amendment understand that lord true the leader of the opposition in the house of lords want to clarify the power of the monarch to confer life peerage that be grant without right to seat in the house of lords the creation of new form of life peerage without any kind of parliamentary responsibility be unnecessary will take intervention as be happy to have this point clarify because quite simply the king already have that power he use it when he grant his brother prince edward the title of duke of edinburgh therefore the power already exist and the need to clarify that power be unnecessary lord true mention that the newly clarify power could be use to honour people without swell the rank of the house of lords however as we have already hear if we want to recognise special contribution to public life there be already plenty of way to do that such as knighthood damehood obe cbe and so on maintain that life peerage should be reserve for those who actively participate in the work of the house of lords and therefore urge the house to disagree with lords amendment speak about lords reform more broadly which have come up during the debate be pleased to read in lords hansard that baroness smith have suggest that select committee set up in the other place could be use to examine mandatory retirement age and minimum participation requirement which know many member in this house support the suggestion include timeframe set the committee up within three month of the bill receive royal assent and it will report back next year so we can make real progress on the other commitment wholeheartedly endorse that approach and look forward to the outcome of this work the hon gentleman be be generous with his time be inclined to agree with he about the appointment of life peer who do not sit do not know the view of member on the government front bench on that but the hon gentleman make good and valid argument if people do not attend it be sensible that they should not retain their right to do so if people be appoint to the house of lords and then never turn up there be good argument that there should be point at which they should be tell that they no long have that title however on the matter of retirement on the ground of age this be very dicey business give that we have legislation that prohibit discrimination on the basis of age the right hon gentleman point be well make and will be follow the work of the select committee closely we have already hear name mention of people who be over the age of and still make great contribution so will follow the committee work closely before make final judgment on the issue more broadly than the work that the committee will undertake once this bill have become law will continue to advocate for second chamber that be more representative of our nation and region my hon friend the member for mid derbyshire jonathan davies who be no long in his place make good point about expertise and not want to lose the expertise in the other place by increase the proportion of people from other region yorkshire and the humber be home to million people and the suggestion that we can not find expert within million people be not necessarily good one be not suggest that he say that but there be still space to increase representation from our nation and region without dilute the expertise that we find in the other place it be not wrong to say that it be clearly easy for somebody to be lord and serve in the other place if they already have base in london and the figure bear that out if we look at the lords own survey we see that they show the breakdown of where each lord come from about quarter of they come from london about come from the south east and only around come from yorkshire and the humber despite my region be home to of the population be round up there so forgive for that what about scotland the hon gentleman chunter from sedentary position when it come to scotland the figure be about or can not recall the actual figure but will check the point remain that we have to make the house of lords more representative of our nation and region we could address this issue in piecemeal way in the same way that we have address the hereditary issue over many decade we could slowly introduce reform after reform on who get appoint where they come from what proportion have to come from yorkshire and so on but be not fan of that approach we should be as bold as possible and do the difficult work now because we be elect to do the difficult work in this term and set out an ambitious plan for the wholesale replacement of the other chamber ready to be make up of people from all our nation and region it should be truly democratic body that draw on the same golden thread that should always exist between the people we serve in this place and those who should sit in second elect chamber interruption hon member chunter that this point be off topic probably agree because the bill do not cover that will draw my remark to close the bill in front of we will remove the archaic right of somebody to sit in parliament because of the family they be bear into find that principle very hard to disagree with the bill show our determination to make our democracy strong and more representative and it should be just the start of our commitment to reform the other place and improve our ability to do what we be all send here to do serve the public find this to be quite curious debate thus far there be not any great energy among member on the conservative benches fully expect and anticipate that they would be down here in great number to defend their noble colleague think there be only one conservative speaker leave look forward to the remark of the hon member for windsor jack rankin there be not the usual energy in the speech of the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart just do not know what be miss there be sense that they can not be bother defend this issue any more which be good thing be also begin to detect little bit of drift between noble lords in the conservative party in the house of lords and conservative members here want to inject some energy let tell the hon gentleman why be energetic about this matter it be preposterous to abolish the hereditary peer in the house of lords on the basis that they give good service that as have already describe legitimately can be derive from variety of source many of they be disproportionately active in that chamber accept that there be manifesto commitment but this could be do in much more measured sensible and moderate way be that enough energy for he that be the way to do it hope the rest of the member on the conservative benches be pay close attention because that be how they defend the indefensible conservative peer have detect one other thing in this debate there seem to be concession that there will not be democratic second chamber have not hear that properly yet so perhaps the minister can clarify in his sum up that be imply and suggest and have not hear anything thus far that contradict it perhaps we could hear the minister say that that idea be now go because do not think that there will be any more reform than this think this be it say in the early stage of the bill that this be as far as lords reform go in this parliament the great gordon brownian vision of senate of the nation and region be totally for the bird it be some sort of fever dream it be not go to happen this bill be all that this house will do about lords reform find the amendment to be snivel contemptuous bunch of amendment they demonstrate the lords contempt for parliamentary democracy and for the democratic will of this house we the members of parliament who be democratically elect to represent the people of this country this house pass the bill with large majority and for all its fault this government say that they would pass it it be manifesto commitment so they should be allow to get on with it but since then the lords have do everything possible to thwart the bill barely have we finish vote before the conservatives in the house of lords commence their save the aristocrat campaign for they the principle of democracy through birthright be something that have to be defend and protect since the bill go down the corridor those peer have try to delay it through filibuster keep the lords up half the night and stack the bill full of amendment it only have two page but they spend hour and minute debate it it only have four clause but amendment be table to it defend the hereditarie be much more important to the house of lords than address thing like poverty grow the economy or global conflict pay real attention to its hansard and some of the contribution be truly bizarre the oozing sense of entitlement from our upper and ruling class be simply extraordinary the thing that get be when those contribution start to get little threaten think the minister imply this the noble lord true warn that if the purge go ahead we would face very aggressive procedural action which could involve filibuster wreck amendment and even bad the parliamentary nuclear option of more ping pong he say that this toff rebellion would only be stand down if goodly number of the hereditarie be to remain do not know about you madam deputy speaker but be positively quake in my oiky boot the prospect of be ermine banshee charge with vintage claret jug and snuff box practically terrify half to death the thing be these peer really do believe that they be bear to rule that their role in our legislature through birthright be gift that we should be eternally grateful for they have now return the bill with these amendment with the main one be to keep the aristocrat in place until death or retirement by reward they with life peerage that be not get rid of the hereditarie it be give they retirement plan after see these amendment just wish that we could introduce even more amendment ourselves would table an amendment that would get they out tomorrow would also be think about strip they of their land and title interruption have get more maybe little bit of re education such as couple of shift in aldi or lidl live on the living wage for week or even bad have they speak in regional accent just for day give that these peer have make this about public contribution give that that be so important to they how about handing over some of their mansion and castle for social housing there be suggestion for how they could be publicly useful know that be be little bit comical madam deputy speaker but what this do be endorse the view that the house of lords be the most embarrassing bizarre legislature anywhere in the world this weird assortment of aristocrat be cassocke bishop party donor crony and placeman feel that they can continue with impunity and they be probably right in that assumption the aristocrat will soon be go do not think there be any real desire to defend they any more but the other member of that circus will continue unabashe they will continue to develop grow and thrive the house of lords be increasingly go to become house of patronage plaything for prime ministers order mr wishart we be debate the amendment not your vision for the future of the house of lords perhaps you should stick to the amendment sorry madam deputy speaker be get little bit carry away the amendment would ensure that the aristocrat remain in the other place but they will not succeed in that aim think we have all sort of agree on that it look like they be go but the rest of the strange assortment of people who we find in the house of lords will still be there it will become house of patronage from the prime minister and we be already begin to see that some new labour peer have be introduce to the house of lords since the last general election and we have hear from the guardian that dozen of new labour peer be about to be introduce that do not seem like government who be keen on even more house of lords reform it seem like government who want to create new set of labour lords at the expense of the hereditarie and the public be thoroughly and utterly sick of it only of the british public approve of the house of lords in its current condition most want to see it abolish certainly nearly everybody want to see the hereditarie go and support they in that vision the labour party promise year ago to abolish the house of lords think it will take at least another year before we see the next set of reform will start by set out some context for why the bill though small be so important and why be delighted to be speak in its support will then address lords amendment and directly as have be mention in the debate in labour promise to end the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the other place in that be exactly what the government be deliver and not moment too soon the principle at stake here be simple and it be about the principle not the process no one should make law for the british people claim daily allowance or influence the future of this country purely on the basis of who their great great grandfather be in my estimation that idea belong in the history book not in modern democracy it be incompatible with the labour party value and anathema to the value of the british people in of course the conservative party will resist we have already hear diversionary tactic today with talk about the blair government reform in when we all know that previous government do not bind the hand of future one we have hear about next step and whether statutory committee or select committee be the right thing to do have ask the opposition about their official policy be still unaware what it be indeed we hear from the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart about his concern that this be all number game remind he that ucl constitution unit have do the math in fact be the change to come into effect the conservative peer would still be the large group of all the party in the other place large even than the cross benchers the conservatives would see minor reduction in composition from to the father of the house the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh mention that he be not supportive of an elect upper chamber be still at loss about exactly what gradual change in the composition of the upper house mean my hon friend mention gradual change which be apparently the policy of the conservative party do he agree that six month temporary arrangement that take quarter of century to overturn be the epitome of gradual my hon friend make an excellent point that be exactly the concern that and many member on the government benches have long stand reform be well overdue we also hear about the principle of monarchy and mention be make of constitutional monarchy on point of order madam deputy speaker be it right to say to that be go off topic when it come to small bill with number of lords amendment when it seem like the hon gentleman be do exactly the same thing from what recall practically everybody else have do that too just to be entirely clear it be the property right element of the hon member contribution that think be beyond scope think all member the house will be conscious that have not be in the chair very long might like to stick to the scope of the amendment and what we be actually debate this afternoon thank you madam deputy speaker will come to the amendment very shortly mention be make of constitutional monarchy number of european country have constitutional monarchy that have hereditary principle but none of they have hereditary member in their parliaments mention be also make of the hereditary principle for parliamentarian be somewhat unique and of the principle of mandatory retirement at certain age indeed the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes mention it of course that principle also exist in the judiciary and do not see any objection there from human right perspective ucl constitution unit find that clear majority of the hereditary peer go for good who can blame they the record speak for itself not single female hereditary peer have be elect in year over third of hereditary peer be concentrate in london and the south east and by election be so farcical that they verge on satire by election be in scope of lords amendment which will come to shortly my electorate in bolton west be about elector in july last year people vote to elect as their mp in order to give they voice in this chamber but in one hereditary peer be elect with dozen vote few than it take to become parish councillor as my hon friend be give his eloquent and excellent speech be remind of comedy series call blackadder in which such bizarre electoral practice happen on our television screen it be shame that they seem to be happen even today my hon friend make very good point indeed he talk of one of my all time favourite comedy it speak to the need for drastic reform of the other place which be long overdue in tory by election in the other place another peer assert that fellow member should vote for he because he race on the solent and garden enthusiastically the electorate for that vote be grand total of these be not truly democratic contest they do not seek to promote those with the very good talent and expertise to serve this country such by election lack the fundamental of what should be at the heart of this mother of parliaments transparency accountability and scrutiny since there have be over of these bizarre contest all with vanishingly small electorate process that is frankly long overdue reform they have all produce lawmaker by accident of birth and that be the principle to which and many member on the labour benches object that be why will be vote against the lords amendment today just to refresh my memory which government institute the arrangement whereby certain number of hereditarie stay and the kind of election that the hon gentleman describe be introduce be it tory government or be it labour government the right hon member will have hear mention previously that previous government do not bind the hand of future government and that this bill be manifesto commitment last year that lead on to the amendment that have come back from the other place lord amendment and table by the noble lord parkinson propose end the by election for hereditarie but retain the current cohort the amendment would hollow out the bill and perpetuate the very problem that we be try to fix urge colleague in the other house to respect the salisbury convention which have already be mention today this house have primacy on election win manifesto pledge conservative colleague have ample opportunity this afternoon to confirm that they respect that constitutional convention and wait with bated breath to hear they speak to that but we can not scrap only the by election process as say it be the principle of hereditary peer that be so objectionable which be why will be vote to make sure that this bill get on to the statute book many hereditary peer have make valuable contribution have work alongside some already in the short amount of time have spend in this place but those who want to continue serve can and should do so on merit they can stand for elect office they can be nominate for life peerage and holac can continue to recommend strong cross bench candidate this bill be not an attack on individual it be an attack on the medieval principle of privilege by birth no one should sit in our parliament because of the deed of their ancestor century ago lord amendment and be not about accountability and they be not about democracy they be patronage dress up as parliament and the conservatives in year in office do absolutely nothing to change the hereditary principle lord amendment from the noble lord true be about so call non sit peerage let we be clear peerage should not be sinecure if the idea be simply to allow hereditary peer to retain their title without sit what social value do this amendment provide if we want to honour people contribution we already have system for that the honours process with knighthood cbe and mbe as the paymaster general stress this amendment look less like reform and more like way of preserve influence we have already see the pattern with title hand out as bargaining chip or reward for party donation this debate have be quite good humour but do have to flag the conservative party tradition of ennoble its treasurer take no pleasure in quote this but as one former conservative party chairman admit in once you pay your million you get your peerage that be not public service it be politic for sale and it be exactly what the public be feed up with in summary will the hon gentleman give way will give way on that final point yes there be of course some appalling practice with the conservatives reward their donor with peerage but do the hon member not remember cash for honour there be police investigation and tony blair be actually question by the police this go on in all party and each of they be disgrace in summary this bill be about rebuild trust in politic it be about end practice that belong to the century not the it be about show the british people that parliament work for they not the privileged few let also say that this bill be just the beginning and be committed to wide reform of the second chamber to improve its national and regional balance to introduce yes mandatory retirement age to require meaningful participation and ultimately to replace it with more modern second chamber fit for the century that be the path to fair more accountable and more democratic politic it be what labour promise which be why be proud to see the government deliver on it rise to speak to lords amendment and and therefore against the motion in two mind say in two mind because find the unilateral removal of the hereditary peer without seek consensus which be what rejection of lords amendment would mean both regrettable and exciting would like to take each of these two polarising mindset in turn my first emotion be regret britain have something of schrödinger cat constitution we be simultaneously modern plural and open democracy and kind of autocratic theocracy our national motto dieu and mon and my right point to the hereditary monarch be appoint by and accountable only to god we have state religion in england and scotland and in england the divinely appoint monarch be the supreme governor of the church the bishop whom the king appoint sit in our legislature as do hereditary peer who be the focus of the amendment the king appoint the judiciary and be the commander of the armed force on paper as labour members have point out the country with which we have most in common be the demonic islamic republic but unlike iran we have simultaneously free and fair election broad debate in free press and freedom of religious and belief and we be an open member of the international order the point be that we would never design our tapestry of constitution in many way it be absurd but it be organic it be root in the millennia of history in two year time we will celebrate the birthday of england the most remarkable nation on earth which majority of we in this place be fortunate to have win the lottery of life to be bear in we should be respectful of that evolution because that evolve constitutional order have empirically serve we well it be how it work in practice that matter not how it look on the ideological grand planner piece of paper be not surprised that my hon friend be make the speech that he be because he understand that essentially our system be an organic one constitution be not write from blueprint they can be but they be not in this country and what he be describe be blend of democratic legitimacy and the other form of the exercise of power what the government be propose be not democratic house of lords but an appoint house that in itself contradict some of the speech make by labour members my right hon friend be right our national story have bring we to place where this house be rightfully dominant among the three part of parliament in exercise the sovereignty of the king in parliament but we should be careful of the wholesale execution of one of those arm let we be clear that be what the unilateral removal of the hereditary peer would do the other place without they be no more house of lords than my terrace house in sunninghill be cromwellian purge it would leave that place the preserve of political crony and fail adviser be that what we want be that progress the house of lords today be difficult to justify but it work this place have the attention span of tiktok addled teenager as we jump to half hourly news cycle drive by twitter and roll news my hon friend be make the correct argument the hereditary peerage in the house of lords represent continuity in our country and wisdom throughout the age most of the house of lords be appoint but that hereditary element be vital as part of the mix of our very successful parliamentary constitution my hon friend point be right and thank he for it we walk through the division lobby direct by the whip often have have no time because of the impossible juggling act to develop real knowledge of the topic in question or to think through properly the implication some of the stuff that leave this place with massive majority might have well be write in crayon thank god for the other place do not remove long serve public servant and outstanding legislator do not pick at the thread of our constitution the other place be one of the part of our constitution which work well we should retain lords amendment and talk of tension conflict in my thinking have try to articulate deeply conservative instinct but also feel excitement as will explain my view be that the british state be way off course dangerously off course it need deep and radical change to take one issue immigration almost nothing be now too radical to consider whether we look at the asylum system or legal migration the radical change that the country need will be of significant scale none of that will be possible in the blairite constitutional straitjacket that be at direct odd with our historic constitution that be fascinating argument the hon gentleman have argue in favour of the lords for their restraint and now he be argue in favour of the lords because they allow radicalism that do not make any sense that be the tension that be try to bring out who would seek to frustrate such an agenda the lords might in their current form find it exciting and this be warning that majority in this house gain from of the vote on turnout which be almost exactly of the adult in this country can remove their opposition from the other place labour members may not agree with the hereditary principle but who else do not get elect in the other place and can not be remove by election it be the life peer say honestly the lack of respect you might have for millennia old principle have for lot of the background reassure the hon gentleman that have plenty of respect for it thank you madam deputy speaker the point be try to make to those on the government benches be that if government can expel their political opponent from the other place because the majority in this place say they be not elect while place no limit on the prime minister patronage so can new government so take the compromise be careful what you wish for our constitution be indeed very curious beast nobody start from scratch would come anywhere near design what we have for this country perhaps apart from the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart and some of those on the benches behind he it have evolve over the century in response to the political pressure that arise from time to time and today be part of that evolution as the constitution have change our tradition have remain for one love bit of tradition in this place especially when it tell the story of how we have come to be where we be whether it be royal assent be signify in norman french or the door of this chamber be shut on the entry of black rod it all tell story however when tradition hold we back from the work we be send here to do it become barrier that be why this bill be introduce within the first day of this labour government we be elect on clear manifesto commitment to remove the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the other place principle that be both simple and long overdue as we have hear from my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince in the century we should have no place in our legislature reserve for those who be bear into certain family it be an outdated and indefensible feature of our constitution and last year the british people give we the mandate to change it yet the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster claim this bill be cromwellian measure be it not oliver cromwell who come into the chamber of our predecessor and shut it down that be not what be happen here today today we be follow through on democratic process consult the people and bring through full act of parliament in both this and the other place will tell the hon gentleman something that be far more cromwellian only few year ago conservative prime minister boris johnson force our late queen to prorogue parliament that be much more cromwellian than anything we be do today the retention of hereditary peer after be mean to be temporary compromise quarter of century later it be time to finish the job today we be nearly there but for some amendment from the other place which want to address in particular lords amendment and just to get cromwell right it be cromwell rather like boris johnson who end the long parliament by walk into this chamber so the parallel be probably close than the hon gentleman would like to suggest cromwell be tyrant really in all kind of other way who want his son to succeed he so he believe in the hereditary principle on the point of substance the point about the house of lords be that it be check on the power of this place and that be helpful thing for government actually as sometimes government benefit from have to think again the continuity that be be argue for from the conservative benches be part of healthy constitutional settlement if we sacrifice that settlement think we will get less good rather than well government agree wholeheartedly with the principle of check on this place however that check must come with due wisdom and expertise we have hear from the conservative benches about those century of wisdom but wisdom can not simply be pass down genetically to people in the other place today surely we need people in the other place who have expertise and be there on merit not because of who their ancestor be lord amendment seek to amend the compromise of by election to replace vacant hereditary peer by allow the cohort of hereditary seat to gradually reduce by natural departure as my right hon friend the paymaster general have say that amendment would effectively delay our manifesto commitment to end the hereditary element in the other place for many year to come as say early this be about not individual or personality but ensure that our institution reflect the value of our modern democracy have see at first hand the important role of the second chamber in scrutinise legislation and improve the quality of lawmaking but that role must be base on merit and public service not on birthright if anyone watch today debate be hereditary peer see none up in the gallery and be dismay at the prospect of no long be able to contribute to the work of the other place say to they do not be downhearted anyone in principle include ex hereditary peer should have the ability to serve as parliamentarian if they be willing and able to do the necessary work and work be the point here do the necessary work bring to lords amendment which would effectively bring about new tradition of create life peerage as honour in name only with no work involve what on earth be the use of that there be plenty of other honour as we have hear that his majesty can bestow that would show due public recognition for service render to this country the other place be not and should not be use as an honours board it should be work and effective part of our legislature our parliament believe that any parliamentarian come to this building to do the work to hold or be hold to account to raise issue that matter to the wide country and to pass good and workable law when be elect on that expectation by my constituent in stevenage that be the pledge promise to uphold although members of the other place do not have expectation from constituent believe there be an expectation from the public as whole that they be there to do the work of good parliamentarian an empty life peerage title would only take away from that public expectation these amendment complicate what be and should be simple task before we to deliver finally on end the principle of hereditary peerage and ensure that the other place be work place in parliament that work for all the people this have be suitably fascinating debate do not plan to speak for too long because the point have already be well make we have have hour here and flippin hour in the house of lords on this concise four clause bill and now we have number of amendment will address lords amendment and lord amendment be fairly straightforward up and down we know what it be it be wreck amendment pure and simple it be nothing more than an amendment design to preserve the hereditary principle in the house of lords principle that be an outdated anachronism that have no place in or any modern democracy the only other comparable democracy be lesotho do not know much about lesotho but would quite like not to share this unenviable record with the good people of lesotho for any long the point have be make that if we do not want the hereditary principle in the house of lords perhaps that mean that we no long want the monarchy nothing could be far from the truth as all member in this place do swear an oath of allegiance to the king have not always be ardent monarchist but support constitutional monarchy and one of the many reason do be because the monarch have absolutely no role in introduce law in amend law or in voting on law the monarch role be quite clear and simple royal assent they do not obstruct the work of this place rightly so and yet we have hear so many time today about the guerilla warfare that be be lead in the other place against numerous piece of legislation in retribution against this simple removal of an anachronism that be not what the king do frankly it be when monarchs have seek to obstruct this house that reference to cromwell be relevant that be not what the bill do it be about remove the hereditary principle from the legislature that develop scrutinise and deliver legislation the king may sign it that be his role the point have be repeatedly make from the government benches that this be matter of principle and that hereditary power be unacceptable now the hon member be right that the king have no role in introduce legislation and so on and so forth but the king do have immense political influence which labour back bencher meet the prime minister weekly to discuss the affair of state rise madam deputy speaker the king of stoke which labour back bencher receive regular report from the whip on the proceeding of this house that be what the king have the king rightly have power and he derive his power by birth delight to inform the right hon member about the parliamentary labour party back bench committee which meet the prime minister weekly when parliament be sit see at least one of my hon friend from the committee in fact there be two here staffordshire be well represent at the moment on the committee and that be quite right oatcake all round for they and of course for the prime minister rise will happily take point in second from my hon friend which presume will be on the lords amendment and not on oatcake but wish to respond fully to the point make by the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes before get so distracted apologise for that self distraction madam deputy speaker the role of the lords in our legislature be quite clear as be the role of the monarch in fact speak this morning to student from emmanuel college in my constituency about the three distinct part of our parliament this place the other place and of course the monarch but the principle under discussion be the ability to introduce amend or vote on legislation the king do none of those so see no contradiction on that important point of principle will now happily accept an intervention be grateful to my hon friend although the moment have pass slightly want to thank he for acknowledge the work of the plp back bench committee will happily bring he some oatcake from home on monday morning thank my hon friend although do not think that will help with my diet however be do the great north run on sunday so will probably need the calorie be happy that we be have the debate but be somewhat surprised by its tenor which run contrary to the salisbury convention its correct name of course be the salisbury addison convention we too often neglect the labour member of that important duopoly it have be surprising particularly so on second reading when the former deputy prime minister the right hon member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden lead for the opposition that there have not be more straightforward argument from the opposition in favour of the hereditary principle because it seem fairly clear that that be what they be argue for dare say there be probably dwindle proportion of the electorate who wish to see the hereditary principle enshrine within those crucial aspect of our legislature in the scope of our discussion but no opposition members appear willing to make that argument be afraid it be an act of constitutional contortion for they to say they merely wish to allow some people to serve out their time if that be the case why do we have election many wonderful public servant on both side of the house lose their seat at the last election but in this place we believe that at the will of the people any of we could be go and that be quite right the hon member be make the point that any of we should be able to go and agree should that not be the case for all parliamentarian and not just those in this house my long stand view on reform of our parliament can be look up by any member if they so wish very much welcome both on second reading and from the front bench today the comment on the future reform of the lords and what that might look like however dare say to the hon gentleman that we might agree on some specific aspect more than he imagine there have not be much discussion of lords amendment on ministers pay welcome the conservative party stout defence of work people and of ensure that people be pay what they be owe we have also hear reference to equality law from the opposition benches and welcome that just think it be such as shame that it be only be apply specifically and uniquely to hereditary peer as conservative members well know there be limit on the number of ministers who can be pay think that be right and do not believe that now be the right time to expand the cost of our politic with more pay ministers however if the conservative party believe genuinely and deep down in its soul that it need to have more pay minister it have year of government in which it could have do that rather than tack it on as distraction from the issue at hand here which be incrementally but crucially reform our constitution support the government position on all the amendment let we get on with this we have have hour of debate and counting let we crack on it have be year think it be time to cut it short draw attention to my interest on two front in that my wife be life peer in the house of lords and salaried minister and very good one at that yes she be very good thank my hon friend for that want to start by address some of the point that the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart make he have leave his characterisation of the house of lords be grossly unfair he characterise everybody who be member as be some sort of pocket stuff hanger on think that expose more about his particular brand of petty grievance politic than it do about the actual calibre of the individual down at the end of the corridor regardless of party affiliation or whether they be independent or bishop the member have come across in committee or joint committee work or in delegation when be previously in the house be good people who want to see the nation benefit and our country thrive and see good politic and good governance the characterisation be often unfair and the hon member for perth and kinross shire belittle his own position as member of this house intervene merely because my hon friend be not here to defend himself so be grateful to the hon member for give way there be number of fine people in the house of lords and have work with they in number of way however democratic accountability should be at the heart labour promise to scrap the house of lords in the first ever manifesto it produce over century ago so although his hon friend the member for gateshead central and whickham mark ferguson might have be wait year we have be wait year for labour to fulfil its commitment to elect and give they that democratic mandate without get draw into the debate on the right and wrong will say that if the scottish national party have want an elect second chamber it could have have one in the scottish parliament but choose not to there be thing about the way in which our democracy work that mean the snp members come down here simply to have pop at this place for their grievance politic in scotland frankly if the snp spend more time think about how it could help the nation rather than its petty nationalism we might be in well place as country and thing would be well in scotland in point relate to amendment as my hon friend the member for telford shaun davies rightly point out lord grocott have propose this bill in the house of lords numerous time over the past year he have try to get to the point when there could have be an opportunity over the past two decade for member who be here by virtue of the hereditary principle to be phase out over time at every opportunity it be block by the conservative party at every opportunity it be talk out when the bill be introduce in this place first by david hanson and then by john spellar the conservative party oppose it say that the principle be wrong and there be not enough reform therefore feel that it be slightly disingenuous now to propose something that the conservatives have oppose for the past two decade as their solution to the problem that they themselves create by not accept it in the first place it be slightly unfair and it be categorisation of their own politic that they seek to find way to frustrate the bill because they have no option for themselves on the somewhat spuriously suggestion that this be way of neuter opposition in the other place the number of conservative peer even after the expulsion of the hereditarie will still make they the large party in the house of lords as my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell point out the labour party be currently the third large party in the house of lords after the cross benchers even after the removal of some of the cross benchers who sit by virtue of hereditary peerage they will still only be slightly behind the labour party the idea that this will remove any form of opposition in the upper house be simply incorrect it do not hold water the other idea that good scrutiny of legislation in the house of lords can somehow happen only by virtue of the application of the mind of the hereditary peer be equally incorrect some of the good challenge to government in this parliament have come from member of the house of lords who have be appoint it do not necessarily mean they be less likely to be independent because they be not there by virtue of hereditary peerage genuinely do not see that for myself the time when have sit and watch the house of lords because their sit hour be later have see that the challenge that come from the bishop the cross benchers and the member of the conservative and liberal party regardless of how they reach there have be thoughtful and well consider and long may that continue do not think that be diminish by virtue of the fact that we say to small group of those who have right in the house of lords your route into this place be an irregularity and we be seek to sort that the shadow paymaster general the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart dispute my figure there have be appointment to the house of lords who have have the conservative whip appreciate that some of those have be resignation honour from previous prime ministers and there be few to get through because of the way their party operate but there have be at any point the former prime ministers could have say we would like to consider give those to member of the hereditary group who be not able to continue there have be number of appointee who be not part of resignation honour list and again the conservative party do not take the opportunity to say to earl howe we be go to make sure that you can continue the hon gentleman be make good speech do he think that give the policy they have embark on the government should have duty to protect cross benchers who have no party representation in this house the hereditary peer who be cross benchers will otherwise go by the wayside would he at least support his government do that it be hard to overestimate the valuable contribution that the cross bench peer make to the house of lords not least the number of retire member of the judiciary who come in to fulfil certain judicial or pseudo judicial responsibility the hon gentleman probably have an element of point that would almost agree with there be conversation to be have about how we ensure that the cross benchers continue to have representation that reflect the breadth of the country and the skill that parliament need obviously there be role for the house of lords appointments commission which can make recommendation for new cross bench peer how that work go forward be sure be something that will be consider again there will still be cross bench peer even after the number of hereditary peer have be expel from the house that be large number of peer all of whom bring an expertise to the house that should be look at if there be new cross bench peer to come in be sure that the commission will make that recommendation the idea that the house of lords will somehow cease to function by virtue of the immediate abolition of hereditary peer do not hold water or make sense we should simply say we be go to have clean break thank you very much for your service we appreciate it if you wish to come back to politic or to parliament you can be nominate to the house of lords for life peerage or you can seek election to this house if the conservative party really want to ensure that some of those hereditary peer be able to come back to this place they could say we go to make sure you be our candidate for the safe conservative seat if there be safe seat for any party these day it could say you can make valuable contribution to politic in way that give you seat in one of the two legislature there be way of do it that simply do not allow for the withering of the situation that we have what be puzzle about be this how do the abolition of these great people who have come to this place with duty of service that they have inherit and serve the country benefit the people of stoke on trent how will our constituent benefit by this change to our constitution do the hon member really think that this country will be so much well for have get rid of our hereditary peer who have such great duty of service to our country the hon gentleman pose fair question would argue that have ringfenced number of seat reserve almost exclusively for white man send the wrong message to my constituent fully accept that there be member of the house of lords at whom my constituent can look and think they have do something spectacular with their life interruption before the hon member for perth and kinross shire jump up there be member who have come in through the by election process after make good contribution in their career and their be there do bring something but do not believe that my constituent would be diminish or harm by their expulsion can not see any justification for keep people in this legislature by virtue of appointment make many decade ago it be small element it be small element as the hon gentleman say but by that same logic the removal of that small element will not have big impact we be grasp at straw let address the suggestion that this be an attack on the hereditary principle the hon member for romford andrew rosindell be probably one member of the house who understand quite well the role of the earl marshal he will continue to be an officer of the house of lords and the role will still be intrinsically link to the family of the duke of norfolk but he will simply not be able to vote in divisions or participate in debate do not believe therefore that this be necessarily an attack on the hereditary principle per se it be simply about say that there be no place for the hereditary principle in modern day democracy will move on the point about give out title as reward do not believe that the amendment be necessary to achieve the conservative party aim not least because the monarch as the font of all honour can create whatever title and style he like with whatever caveat he like through letter patent it do not immediately mean that one have to become member of the house of lords by virtue of have life peerage if the letter patent say something different be sure that the shadow paymaster general be well read up on the wensleydale decision of when life peerage be create for sir james parke but it be specify that he could not be member of the house of lords the principle of establish title and style for reward and recognition without tie they to seat in the lords already exist so the amendment be entirely unnecessary my final point which have not be the subject of much discussion as it be not party knockabout issue relate to lords amendment on the capacity of colleague in the house of lords it be clear that many member of the house of lords have serve our country and their community well but some find themselves in old age and decline health they deserve the dignity of be allow to retire from that place without it become story of capacity the amendment which be accept by the government and the opposition in the lords be an important way of recognise that we can make small change every day to the house of lords as the previous government do on the ability to retire and take leave of absence this government be ensure that resignation can be grant for member subject to power of attorney that be an important change and hope that it get cross party support to summarise what my hon friend the member for gateshead central and whickham mark ferguson say this legislation have be long time come and be part of the evolution of the house of lords the opposition amendment do nothing to improve the bill they would simply slow the pace of reform and add bit that do nothing more than frustrate the passage of the bill when it go back to the other place urge the house to reject the opposition amendment and to support the government in bring dignity to those who need to retire with capacity issue so that we can progress with build more modern and successful democracy with the leave of the house will close the debate and it be privilege to close this wide range and well natured debate the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart have be treat somewhat unfairly in the course of the debate the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart accuse he of lack of energy but he be completely wrong the contribution from the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster may have be ill judge but it be certainly energetic we can give he that his contribution be in some way brave some would even say it have chutzpah about it when he accuse of trash precedent while simultaneously trash precedent himself the labour manifesto of last year say the next labour government will therefore bring about an immediate modernisation by introduce legislation to remove the right of hereditary peer to sit and vote in the house of lords not over time as lords amendment propose which be about half century if we look at the age of the young hereditary peer but immediately lord amendment which the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster support be therefore an absolute breach of the salisbury addison convention under which this measure should be allow on to the statute book we be under no obligation to support government legislation in the commons let just repeat that point to the hon gentleman because it be important he claim to respect precedent and the right of parliament but the position he take in support lords amendment run coach and horse through that this be the commons we be not oblige to support you fine let put it this way the hon gentleman be support the position that his peer be take which be in breach of that convention will give the hon gentleman another chance because he be try to put defence up on that particular precedent he support the closing down of parliament in and now he sit here lecture on precedent think it be good not to take any lecture from the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster on that there be an opportunity for the opposition this afternoon they do not have to join in with the filibuster tactic that have be use with ten of hour of debate on this very narrow bill the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster could today have not join in but he will lead his troop through the lobby to continue to try to block these reform that be what this be all about it be not as he pretend about try to improve the bill it be not that those on the tory front bench be secretly in favour of radical reform and this be not radical enough for they they be try to wreck this bill and that be exactly what he will do as he go through the lobby with his troop later the minister may remember that at the beginning of the debate ask he to bear in mind the circumstance of some of the people who have give their life to this place over the last or year and be not in the good financial health we be not in downton film have its premiere last night if he make the decision to get rid of hereditary peer immediately what support will be put in place by the house authority which know he would want to work with and the government to ensure that those people be look after may push he to consider the more practical proposal of wait until the end of the session rather than immediately get rid of the hereditary peer it be not my decision it be the decision of the british people at the last general election in support our manifesto if the bill get on to the statute book hereditary peer will leave at the end of this parliamentary session repeat the point we have hear throughout the debate there be no barrier to they become life peer indeed there be no barrier to they stand to become member of this house if they wish to continue their public service will the minister give way will give way then need to make some progress thank the minister for his generosity he frequently cite the labour party manifesto which do include this provision in relation to the abolition of hereditary peer however it also include provision in relation to mandatory retirement age why have he choose to bring forward the abolition of hereditary peer but not wait until he have resolve the position in relation to the retirement age surely there be only one reason for that which be that it benefit the labour party politically to remove conservative hereditary peer immediately and it be of less political benefit to the labour party to have mandatory year old retirement age the manifesto be clear that the reform would be stag and that this would be the immediate first step the government remain in favour of house of lords that be more representative of the nation and region and this be the first step as the leader of the house of lords announce select committee will then look at retirement age and indeed at participation my hon friend the member for mid derbyshire jonathan davies make the point which repeat that this be not personal issue but an issue of principle know the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for richmond park sarah olney welcome the bill as first step and she also speak about the appointment process indeed over recent month the government have ensure that when people be select for place in the house of lords there be now an explanation or citation we always have citation when people be award honours but we do not have one for those nominate for place in the house of lords that have now be change my hon friend the member for telford shaun davies set out powerfully that lords amendment which concern the abolition of hereditary by election have be put forward time and again by lord grocott and on every single occasion it be block by the conservatives the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh regular spar partner of mine accuse of be bit unfair to the conservatives in the century life peerage be of course introduce in the late but it be certainly the case that the conservatives have block every opportunity to abolish the hereditary principle and that be exactly what they be do again my hon friend the member for leeds south west and morley mark sewards make powerful speech about the central purpose of the bill and the government position on the amendment the hon member for perth and kinross shire make his characteristic contribution to the debate and would agree with the point he make about filibuster in the other place on this bill my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell make well the point that even after this change the conservatives will still be the large single party in the house of lords then come to the speech by the hon member for windsor jack rankin who seem think to be simultaneously argue for maintain the hereditary peer and for radical reform when he talk about parliamentarian with the attention span of tiktok video think he mean the shadow justice secretary for minute we have hear the hon member for clacton nigel farage make comparison with north korea but the hon member for windsor make comparison with iran this bill be quintessentially british it be about british democracy it be about put an argument to the electorate last july and then put that into practice my hon friend the member for stevenage kevin bonavia make the powerful case that this be about principle and about there not be series of place in our legislature that be reserve for people by accident of birth my hon friend the member for gateshead central and whickham mark ferguson who be sure the whole house will wish well for the great north run make powerful case for the abolition of the hereditary principle and the position of the bill also say real thank you to my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell who have make powerful case for change throughout every stage of the passage of the bill through the house of commons this have be perfectly reasonable debate rise before conclude my remark will certainly give way be grateful to the paymaster general for give way as feel that he be draw to the end of his comment one thing he have not discuss in his round up of the debate be ministerial pay appreciate the remark that he make at the start and that he do not believe this be the right way or place to do that but do he accept in principle that in future the government should find legal mechanism for ensure that all minister of the crown regardless of the house in which they sit be pay will just come to the other point that we be raise have make clear that lords amendment gut the purpose of the bill which be why the government oppose it on the other amendment first be pleased with and thank the hon gentleman for his support on amendment on the introduction of the power of attorney think that the whole house accept that there be people who wish to retire and that be dignity that we should give they we all appreciate that on the other two point do not regard the creation of new separate honour as necessary or worthwhile have this exchange early with the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes we already have an honours system that recognise outstanding contribution to our society think that we should maintain that link between the title and do work in our legislature understand the point that the hon member for brentwood and ongar have make couple of time about ministerial pay and minister carry out role the point that would make to he however be that that require an amendment if he want to make that argument and have debate he be perfectly entitle to do that but the mechanism in the bill will not have the impact that think he be seek to have in that respect to conclude be conclude not just this afternoon debate but ten of hour of debate in the other place we be move towards house of lords that be fair open and truly representative of the nation it serve house where expertise be recognise and not inherit where policy be shape by merit and not by bloodline commend the government position to the house question put that this house disagree with lords amendment diane

autocracy be in the ascendency and false news spread like the speed of light government funding for service that bring truth to the world have never be more important could not agree more may take the opportunity to thank the hon gentleman again for the excellent debate on the bbc world service which he lead on june if remember correctly and which give the idea to bring forward the subject of bbc monitoring separately over very many year bbc monitoring have build up the close conceivable relationship with its united states counterpart know as open source enterprise or ose indeed the two organisation be base on alternate floor of the caversham park headquarters divide between they the coverage of global broadcasting to the enormous benefit of both country in the transatlantic alliance this be the nerve centre of world beat open source intelligence yet the bbc decide to evict ose and sell the caversham estate thank the right hon gentleman for make such an excellent speech caversham park sit in my constituency and it be wonderful facility pay tribute to those who work there over many year break vital news story and provide information to the foreign office such as the initial news report of the iranian revolution in and many other similar event that be only able to be record because of the amazing talent of the linguist and journalist base at the facility which have sadly now be mothball and be due to be sell to developer would the right hon member like to comment on the role of those staff be extremely grateful for that intervention be sure that the staff of bbc monitoring both present and past will be grateful to the hon gentleman for the support that he have rightly express for they be grateful to the right hon gentleman for bring this debate to the house conduct my phd research at the bbc national archive centre which be within caversham park and every lunch time would have lunch with the extraordinary linguist who occupy the building that the hon member for read central matt rodda have just describe the loss of bbc monitoring if that be indeed to come about would be considerable national loss it represent an incredibly important part of not only our security past but our security future for the reason that have be mention previously such as the rise of disinformation do the right hon gentleman agree that we need to preserve these institution because so often we do not know what we have get until it be go yes indeed if ever something encapsulate the concept of soft power and indeed buttress and underpin some of the agency that have to delve from more secret source for information this be an example of that rise must say it be gratify in an end of day adjournment debate on thursday early evening to have so many people so keen to intervene include the hon member for harlow chris vince thank the right hon gentleman for let intervene and for his wonderful introduction to my intervention he mention the importance of soft power which we speak great deal about in the debate secure by my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley do he agree that it be not only case of not know what we have get until it be go but that if we be to lose the bbc monitoring service as well as the bbc world service not that we be suggest that of course it would be very difficult to get it back have realise the error we have make on the bbc world service will mention the conversation that he and have in that debate about how when the service be pull out of particular country it be sometimes replace with the propaganda that we be try to avoid absolutely the only good thing to be say about the propaganda of one adversary be that sometimes unwittingly it give we an insight into their plan and forewarning of their evil intent let we ensure that we preserve the crown jewel and that we do not rely simply on fluctuation in licence fee income for that necessary task have say that the caversham estate be to be sell off despite the amazing integration that exist there with the american counterpart of the foreign broadcast information service which be now know more regularly as the ose it be therefore no wonder that the defence committee decide to entitle its december report open source stupidity the threat to the bbc monitoring service that be pun on open source intelligence and for those interested it be hc and it be still in print the then defence committee chairman whom modesty prevent from identify point out this be long quote but it be worthwhile that the coalition government be warn in the strong possible term not to leave the bbc monitoring service unprotecte by end its ring fence annual grant and transfer this minor financial burden to the licence fee payer by do so it give the bbc free hand to inflict successive round of cut now culminate in the loss of the specialised and dedicated caversham headquarters the vast increase in open source information in the recent past make it one of the few tool still leave in the government arsenal which can provide almost real time information and analysis on global development to allow the bbc to change and shape it in different direction be in contravention of uk national interest it be especially bewildering when you consider the annual cost of bbc monitoring be around million the decision to evict bbc monitoring us counterpart open source enterprise from its uk base at caversham park and break the physical link between the two be short sighted the bbc strategy for bbc monitoring will downgrade our contribution to open source intelligence sharing between the uk and the us at time when european nation must demonstrate to president elect trump as he then be for the first time that we be committed to pay our way in the field of defence and security as one of our witness say this be the height of folly that be long quote but it be true then and it be true today rise rise will give way first to the hon member for halesowen alex ballinger the right hon member be deliver an excellent speech as the defence committee do in the foreign affairs committee be now conduct an inquiry into disinformation which cover many of the same area that he discuss do he agree that the increase spread of disinformation increasingly in country that be non english speak but have real geopolitical significance for the uk make the bbc monitoring service even more important today than it be in agree entirely and before give way for the next intervention will read what have just be about to say the report main conclusion be that the government should reinstate their previous model of fund bbc monitoring through ringfenced grant in aid rather than allow the funding to come from the licence fee as non partisan cross party body doubt if today defence committee would take radically different view indeed we have just hear from the foreign affairs committee representative that that view still have great deal of validity be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way even if he choose my hon friend the member for halesowen alex ballinger before wish to congratulate the right hon gentleman on the report which have in front of note that only three colleague who be on the committee in be still in this house the fact that he make these point now as he do almost year ago speak to the challenge we face as well as to the threat to our ability to tackle the geopolitical challenge to which he have refer and how we will be find want in that effort if we do not get this right and get it right soon it be very gratifying to an old timer like to see fresh generation of serious minded hon and right hon member from all party so united on this common theme in the national interest will have to race on bit now so as not to cut into the minister time too much so far have focus in large part on the negative as the house have hear but all be not picture of doom and gloom despite the substantial redundancy of after the reduction in licence fee funding and the closure of caversham park an year customer service agreement be sign with the government cover the period to inclusive business development team also succeed in widen the commercial customer base and lessening to some extent the dependence on the licence fee those in charge at bbc monitoring be in no doubt of the importance of their mission they point out in most helpful briefing document that they provide to that in today environment of intensify information warfare weaponise narrative and global instability the value of bbc monitoring work be more crucial than ever they note the global medium landscape have undergo profound transformation drive by the rapid expansion of social medium the democratisation of content creation and the accelerate capability of generative ai these shift have dramatically increase the volume and velocity of disinformation in response bbc monitoring have evolve its editorial strategy move beyond translation and summarisation to deliver expert evidence base analysis the introduction of data specialist have enable the production of interactive map graphic and other tool that help user navigate complex information environment bbcm have expand its coverage of chinese russian and iranian medium influence operation of jihadism of climate change of water and energy security and of migration all issue that be central to our national interest and foreign policy its product underpin the work of bbc journalism particularly when report on country where direct access be restrict or prohibit there be in short no question about the irreplaceable value inherent in the bbc monitoring service by secure this debate and share the content of this speech in advance with the minister as have aim to give the government an opportunity to endorse its vital work tonight and perhaps shine little light on some relevant aspect of that first on its budget at the time of the december defence committee report the annual cost of bbcm be know as say early to be modest million what be its budget today and what percentage of its income derive from the licence fee and from each of its other main funding source if the minister can not be too specific this evening would be grateful if he might write to in more detail secondly now that the us open source enterprise organisation be most regrettably no long co locate with bbc monitoring in the united kingdom what be the nature of the residual relationship between the two organisation do they no long together cover the globe freely exchange their respective product as in the day of caversham park do bbcm even see the ose product do it have to pay for it and if so how much income do bbc monitoring receive for supply its output to the united states thirdly understand that bbcm have take some stride in introduce artificial intelligence into its modus operandi how far do it expect that process to go and will human expertise and judgment remain integral to its monitoring work fourthly while the restoration of an annual government grant would be by far the most secure funding model in the absence of that be there any danger of bbc monitoring be cut loose from the world service organisation and farm out insecurely to bbc sounds as have previously be moot finally with new agreement have to be negotiate with the government before the expiry of the exist one in two year time will the minister please undertake to set out specific detail of the target quantity of actual monitoring output not to be conflate with analysis specify under the exist agreement and the extent to which those target have or have not be achieve only in that way shall we know if our vital open source intelligence operation truly have the resource it need be extraordinarily grateful to the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis for secure this important debate and share his remark with in advance can assure he that
