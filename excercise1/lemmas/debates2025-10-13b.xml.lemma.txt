in the private rent sector my department do not hold datum on the proportion of people who have be grant asylum status live in the private rent sector in england it be extraordinary that the minister do not have that answer too many asylum seeker be arrive in our community far too quickly because the government have fail on their promise to smash their gang people have have enough and this labour government do not seem to have any answer what action will the minister take to support local community and public service to deal with the grow number of asylum seeker in our community be afraid will take no lecture from the hon gentleman as it be the previous conservative government in which he serve as minister who lose control of our border and preside over the complete breakdown of the asylum system this government be restore order to that system speed up decision make and reform the appeal process to cut the asylum backlog and remove those with no right to be here at much fast rate than the previous government our country have proud history of provide sanctuary to those flee persecution genuine asylum seeker who have be grant refugee or humanitarian protection status should be welcome the hon gentleman would have say the same some year ago and it be sign of just how far his party have fall that he can not now bring himself to do so call the shadow minister despite that answer it be clear that thing be get bad our council be battle with the cost of this government border failure the rise in small boat arrival combine now with chagossians arrive in rise number throw themselves at the mercy of our local authority as they escape starmer sell out be stretch council housing budget to breaking point the government have refuse to answer my write question about what financial support they provide to council housing asylum seeker and refugee who be grant asylum in their area can the minister tell the house how much of the propose rise in council tax be for the cost of the government asylum failure and will he publish the full cost and support in the interest of transparency the hon gentleman be conflate two separate issue genuine asylum seeker who have be grant refugee status and who can stand on their own two foot and work will rent in some case in the private rent sector and in other case in market housing some dispersal accommodation for those seek asylum will of course be in the private rented sector and that can add pressure to local rental market that be why decision must be make in co ordination with local authority and take into account local housing pressure more importantly that be why the reduction in hotel use need to be proceed with in an ordered and manage way not the chaotic way that the conservatives have be call for new housing developments infrastructure what step he plan to take to ensure that new housing development have adequate access to infrastructure the national planning policy framework set out that the purpose of the planning system be to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development include the provision of support infrastructure in sustainable manner we make change to the framework in december last year that will support the increase provision and modernisation of various type of public infrastructure local development plan should address need and opportunity in relation to infrastructure and identify what infrastructure be require and how it can be fund and bring forward in my constituency we have see promise of new school and clinic repeatedly break but in every case it be not the developer or local council that let people down but national body such as the department for education and integrated care board they do it to save money by cram more kid into exist school and more patient into pack clinic in the light of the extra house that have just be announce by the chancellor for horsham district will the minister meet to discuss how we can legally ensure that key local infrastructure promise be meet the hon gentleman know that be always happy to sit down and talk to he about these and other issue it must be say that when prepare local plan plan practice guidance recommend that local planning authority use available evidence of infrastructure requirement to prepare an infrastructure funding statement local authority be not do that in all case which be why the chief planner write to all local planning authority recently to remind they of their statutory duty to do so we can discuss that and other issue when meet he new housing development agree under the previous government have be build on the green belt around village in the shipley constituency such as burley in wharfedale wilsden denholme and cullingworth often without the vital investment in infrastructure such as gp practice school and other council service will the minister reassure my constituent that as we build the much need affordable and social home we will prioritise brownfield and ensure adequate investment in the community can give my hon friend that assurance ours be brownfield first policy she highlight an important point the previous government release vast swathe of the green belt in haphazard and chaotic manner we be take strategic approach to green belt release prioritise the release of the low quality grey belt and we be ensure that where that happen subject to our golden rule we see high level of affordable housing and infrastructure it be much smart approach the previous government do not adopt it and they should stop carp about it now housing development statutory consultees water company what assessment his department have make of the potential merit of require water company to be statutory consultee for new housing development water company be not statutory consultee on individual planning application but they be consult as part of the preparation of local development plan on january the government declare moratorium on any new statutory consultee and announce review of the exist statutory consultee arrangement consultation on proposal design to limit the scope of statcon to where advice be strictly necessary and to remove entirely limited number of they will be publish in the near future outdated sewer system mix clean rainwater with sewage pollute river and place strain on outdated infrastructure if the government be intent on not make water company statutory consultees national rainwater management strategy mandate rainwater harvesting on new home and major renovation would ease the pressure on infrastructure and reduce the likelihood of sewage overflow what recent conversation have the minister have with the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs about introduce national rainwater management strategy will he consider make rainwater harvesting mandatory requirement on new housing development the hon gentleman raise an apt point regularly meet colleague from the department for environment food and rural affairs to discuss range of issue include water efficiency and management draw his attention to the consultation we launch just last month to review the water efficiency standard in the building regulations as part of that we be investigate how we can bring technology such as rainwater harvesting into new development safely devolution impact on economic growth what assessment he have make of the potential impact of devolution on economic growth devolution to strong local leader who understand the economic opportunity and challenge in their patch have clear economic benefit it can drive high productivity boost local economy and put more money in people pocket for example greater manchester which be far along in its devolution journey have one of the uk fast grow local economy be pleased to see that the government be press ahead with their commitment to implement new strategic authority may press the minister to consider how those new strategic authority can grow their local economy by provide support for thing like community business and social enterprise in town centre help to regenerate and renovate the neglect high street we see across the country my hon friend be completely right to highlight that there be huge opportunity for strategic authority to support community business co operative and social enterprise to help regenerate and revitalise our town centre and build community wealth we be already see that across the country we see it in liverpool city region where significant investment be go into community business we be keen to build on this opportunity and to unlock it across the country devolution be start off well in north yorkshire but north yorkshire council be really concerned about the upcoming local government settlement which will obviously be challenge for all council may urge the secretary of state in his new role to look carefully at the most rural county in england and the particular challenge that it have in deliver service we be look closely at every area we know that local government be go through the process of reorganisation at the same time as we be do devolution we be do that at pace but we be do it in strong collaboration work closely with individual area we welcome devolution in london but the ability of local council like mine in wandsworth to tackle growth could be undermine by the change propose in the fair funding review in wandsworth of resident and of child live in poverty after housing cost will the minister consider make adjustment to the propose funding formula to properly account for housing and child service and ensure that no council be bad off as result of the review we have consult on the fair funding review my colleague the minister for local government and homelessness be look at proposal at the moment and we will report back in due course devolution can have huge benefit for local people use million of funding from the last government stockton on tees borough council have bring forward proposal to change yarm high street but the council have completely fail to properly consult and work with local resident and business in develop the proposal so what could be an opportunity have become nightmare do the minister agree that such change should be do with local resident and business and not force upon they one hundred per cent devolution offer the opportunity to put community in the drive seat and give they genuine power for example this government pride in place programme put community right at the centre because we think that be how to ensure that community come together to drive the change that they want to see in their area we encourage all council to work closely with their local community to make that change happen new social housing rural town and villages what step he be take to support the building of social housing in rural town and village the billion social and affordable home programme will support wide range of social and affordable housing include council housing support housing community lead housing and of course rural housing the government will also consider how planning policy can well promote rural affordable housing through our work on national policy which will be bring forward for decision making later in the year thank the secretary of state for that response cornwall have be give an ambitious annual target of home and sincerely hope that large proportion of those will be for the cornish family on the housing waiting list meet so many constituent in social and private housing who have be leave high and dry by dodgy developer who go into liquidation before they can deliver vital infrastructure such as road and sewerage work will the secretary of state please meet to discuss the enforcement tool that local authority need to properly hold those developer to account certainly recognise the problem that the hon member describe it be an issue in north cornwall and right across the country on the developer contribution we be look at how we can strengthen enforcement so that where commitment be make they be deliver on and local community be not strand and leave high and dry because the vital infrastructure to support the home never appear long term empty homes what step he be take to bring long term empty home back into occupation welcome minister thank you very much mr speaker the government want more empty home bring back into use across the country include through the step we outline in the english devolution white paper to strengthen local authority ability to take over the management of vacant residential premise welcome the minister to her new role will the government consider introduce policy whereby long term empty property bring back into use as home will count towards district housing target local authority have number of power to deal with empty home the hon member raise an interesting point which will take away and consider with official there be long term empty property in the community of park end in my constituency park end desperately need regeneration so be delighted that the government have award it million of pride in place funding for the community to use for regeneration over the long term will the government commit to work with to make sure that the local community get the good from that funding absolutely be really encourage by the way that local community be seize the opportunity of pride in place funding and take it forward to deal with an issue that affect every council across the country community

support for it in the revise national planning policy framework publish last year and in march we announce year social finance investment to provide capital funding for community lead housing as part of the development of our long term housing strategy we be consider how the government might far support the growth of the sector redwood housing co operative span five floor of social housing in the iconic oxo tower on the south bank of the river thames give that redwood be run by its tenant charge some of the low rent in central london and offer some of the good view should not every community have redwood my hon friend have long champion co operative and recognise his commitment to expand co op in london and across the country with that example he draw our attention to the benefit that they can provide we be consider opportunity to legislate to establish legal framework for co operative housing tenure which would help formalise the right and responsibility of both co operative and their tenant and make co operative housing more attractive option as my hon friend will know be more than happy to discuss the matter with he far at suitable opportunity in the near future in my chichester constituency lack of available land drive high density scheme in rural village that lack the necessary infrastructure and the scheme quickly become unpopular locally community land trust such as the westbourne land trust gain local support and deliver affordable home and that give community real stake in that development do the minister agree that community buy in be essential if the government be to reach their target for build home what step be be take to help community land trust go from the planning phase to build home the hon lady outline another benefit of community land

trust in and we be commit to work with it to support our coalfield community that come alongside our wide effort to invest in community that be hold back under the conservative party through our trailblaze pride in place programme rise be intrigue to hear how coalfield regeneration relate to the hon gentleman part of northern ireland call jim shannon thank you mr speaker thank the minister for that answer the fact be that there be coalfield in northern ireland there have be an opportunity order so the hon gentleman be say that he have coalfield in his constituency interruption okay be go to allow the question but ask that we think about whether issue be relevant to our constituency the question of who benefit from coalfield in the past be always relevant to people in northern ireland other part of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland have experience coalfield regeneration and people have come back from those area on the mainland to northern ireland can we ensure that everyone have an equal opportunity to benefit from this these benefit have be bring forward in england bring they forward in northern ireland as well be not sure that that be relevant we recognise that we need to support community across the country who have be hold back we be work with the northern ireland office to make sure that support be available for community to renew and regenerate so that they have the power to drive the change that they want to see homelessness what step he be take to reduce youth homelessness what recent progress the inter ministerial group on homelessness and rough sleeping have make on the development of cross government strategy to end homelessness the government inherit homelessness crisis there be record number of people in temporary accommodation and rough sleeping have double that be why my predecessor get together the inter ministerial group on homelessness very quickly it have meet four time and have establish the principle of the strategy have seek full input from across government that strategy be on its way but just last week the government announce furth million in this financial year to support people who be sleep rough or who be homeless the minister announcement be welcome but last year in england and wales of the people who be find to be at risk of homelessness or be experience homelessness be age just to that number be far too high will the minister agree to meet the ymca and the youth homeless chapter collective to discuss the action need to support young people and reduce homelessness for good congratulate my hon friend on share those figure with the house because even though it be quite hard to hear they it be important that we do not look away from this crisis will of course meet she and the charity she mention as the minister may know milton keynes use to be call tent city we reduce the number of rough sleeper down to when be deputy leader at the council we be able to do that because we understand that rough sleeping be more than just housing issue it be whole person issue be she willing to meet and the other officer of the all party parliamentary group on rough sleeping as well as back bench members who have experience in this area while shape and deliver the rough sleeping strategy be aware of my hon friend work and the work of milton keynes council and other in the city to bring down the number of rough sleeper we will take that whole person approach in the homelessness strategy never knowingly avoid meeting with an appg so be sure that we will get that arrange shortly reduce youth homelessness rely on have an effective work housing market of course my right hon friend the member for north west essex mrs badenoch understand that and that be why she have pledge that future conservative government will abolish stamp duty on primary residence she have also say that she be happy for the idea to be steal and adopt by other party it would reduce the cost of house buying in beverley and holderness by around real boost for young family try to get on the housing ladder will the minister say to the secretary of state and indeed the chancellor adopt this policy and do it now the party of liz truss just do learn do it the conservatives be happy to make tax policy that be absolute fantasy people need real home to live in not this kind of thing and the conservatives simply will not get hearing until they look at their record and learn to say sorry call the chair of the select committee welcome the secretary of state and his ministers to their position very much look forward to welcome they to meeting of the select committee we be fair and robust committee the minister highlight the inter ministerial group which the former secretary of state chair and see as be very important the issue cut across all departmental group it be important because within two month as we go into the next year and in the next financial year we will see over young child in temporary accommodation in homelessness that should worry all of we the inter ministerial group have meet four time can the minister confirm that the group will continue to be convene and if it will who will chair it the chair of the select committee make the case extremely well if anybody in this chamber be not worried about temporary accommodation they be not pay attention that be how serious this be it be terrible for our kid and for the taxpayer because it be so expensive will follow up with she lot of work have already be do on the homelessness strategy we want to get it confirm as soon as possible will engage fully with the select committee on the strategy to ensure that we get it right and we will come back to she shortly with the detail of how we will do that together every night over child be homeless in my city they be either in temporary accommodation or even bad off do the minister agree that this be totally unacceptable for modern society and that the government must bring forward its cross departmental plan to tackle youth homelessness refer the hon gentleman to what just say to the chair of the select committee but let confirm again that any child in temporary accommodation particularly accommodation who have not get enough space to do their homework pay the price not just through what they be go through today but in the future we can not accept that we can not stand for it and we should work together across this house to bring this to an end thank to the action of the previous government and council up and down the country of rough sleeper be get off the street at the beginning of the pandemic five and half year ago tragically since then most of those people young and old have return to rough sleeping in constituency like mine street homelessness be not so obvious people be live and sleep in wood ruin and so on yet the tragedy be still there what lesson can the minister and the government learn from that rapid removal of homeless people from the street in so that they can implement it again thank the hon gentleman for his point homelessness can be about rough sleeping but there be also hide homelessness our forthcoming strategy need to consider all that in the round he ask what lesson take from what happen few year ago and would argue from how we reduce rough sleeping in the past would say that politics be about choice we take the choice last week to invest in year an extra million in prevent and address homelessness that be the right thing to ensure that everybody in this country be safe and have roof over their head call the shadow minister welcome the minister to her place youth and overall homelessness have increase since the government take office and charity have be harm by policy such as the national insurance rise impose by the chancellor we welcome the additional money that the government have allocate for tackle homelessness this winter but it be an admission that they have fail in their pledge to reduce homelessness the former minister have novel touch and send the figure the wrong way will ask this minister the same question that ask in the previous session do she accept that homelessness have rise under this government and will she commit to eliminate it by the end of this parliament thank the hon gentleman for his word of welcome refer he to the comment that make to colleague the homelessness strategy be on its way be afraid that we could not overturn year of wrong choice in the time that we have have in office that be not realistic but our strategy on its way if there be cross party support for go much far to reduce the use of temporary accommodation and ensure that everyone have roof over their head will happily work with he to do that together new social housing buckingham and bletchley what step his department be take to support local authority to build social housing in buckingham and bletchley constituency the government have take decisive action to improve the capacity of all local authority include those in buckingham and bletchley to build more social housing include through our new billion social and affordable home programme the new year social housing rent settlement and right to buy reform so that we can reverse the decline see under the previous government the on time on budget delivery of new council home for local family on the lakes estate in bletchley be good demonstration of what labour can achieve in local government be my right hon friend willing to visit bletchley over the come week and month to discuss how further investment from the social and affordable home programme could help ambitious pro housebuilde council like milton keynes to go even far for local people be sure that it will come as no surprise to my hon friend that wholeheartedly welcome the delivery of new council home in his constituency fully agree that the lakes estate demonstrate the ambition of milton keynes city council to build the home that its community want and need also value such council support in help the government to meet our ambitious housebuilding target which include target for the big boost to social and affordable housing in this country in generation new housing developments in cheadle infrastructure what step he plan to take to ensure that new housing development in cheadle constituency have adequate access to infrastructure as per my answer to question the change that we make to national planning policy last year be intend to support the increase provision and modernisation of various type of public infrastructure when it come to ensure that necessary infrastructure be fund and bring forward in cheadle or any other part of the country we look to local development plan and infrastructure funding statement to address need and opportunity resident in cheadle have contact about the huge number of speculative development application come through particularly in cheadle hulme and woodford we be now be tell that home new town will potentially be situate on the constituency border gps be completely oversubscribed in woodford we have not have sunday rail service in over year and the bus service be completely inadequate this have be raise time and again by my constituent will the minister meet and the leader of stockport council to talk about this issue and how the government can get developer to start invest in infrastructure before they develop home the hon gentleman have raise number of issue the good way in which local planning authority can protect themselves from speculative development be to have an up to date local development plan in place he touch on developer contribution we remain committed to strengthen the exist system to ensure that new development provide the necessary affordable home and infrastructure we will set out further detail in due course when it come to the prospective new town that the hon gentleman mention gently point out that it be not the government but the independent expert new town taskforce that recommend to the government that adlington and other location in england should be the site for the next generation of new town on september we commence strategic environmental assessment to understand the environmental implication of new town and that will support final decision but no final decision have yet be take order should say that that be the adlington in cheshire not lancashire leasehold system what step he plan to take to reform the leasehold system what step his department be take to increase leaseholder protection the government continue to implement those reform to the leasehold system that be already in statute and to progress the wide set of reform necessary to end the feudal leasehold system for good we have bring into force number of provision in the leasehold and freehold reform act with more in the pipeline and we remain on course to publish an ambitious draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill later this year leaseholder in my constituency face unfair practice such as management fee triple in as many year stretch family beyond their mean yet there be also great number of responsible agent include lettings base in ashmore park can the minister set out how the government leasehold reform will strike the right balance protect leaseholder from poor practice without overburden responsible agent who already provide transparent and fair service we know that there be good manage agent who work hard to ensure that the resident they be responsible for be safe and secure and that home be properly look after but we also know that far too many leaseholder suffer from poor service at the hand of unscrupulous manage agent in our recent consultation on strengthen leaseholder protection over charge and service we consult on power to appoint manager or replace manage agent as well as on mandatory professional qualification for manage agent in england we think that those proposal strike the right balance but we be analyse all the feedback we receive to that consultation thank the minister for his answer to the previous question in my constituency of bury st edmunds and stowmarket leaseholder be face soar service charge and fall standard some have tell that they be consider withhold payment do my hon friend agree that much great regulation of property manager be urgently need to ensure accountability and standard my hon friend highlight that as many of we know the reality of home ownership for so many leaseholder fall far short of the dream we absolutely agree that we need to strengthen the regulation of manage agent to drive up the standard of their service we be look again at lord best report on regulate the property agent sector particularly in the light of the recommendation in the final grenfell inquiry report we have set out number of specific proposal in the consultation that refer to in my previous answer our preferred approach in implement mandatory professional qualification be for agent to belong to designated body but all final decision will be take in due course as the minister will be aware some freeholder find themselves trap in leasehold like situation the wide estate that they live on be manage by management company and not adopt by the local authority they be fleece in exactly the same way by exorbitant management charge and there be often unadopted road and poor sewerage will the minister meet to discuss how we can provide protection for freeholder who find themselves in that leasehold situation we remain committed to protect residential freeholder on private and mixed tenure housing estate from unfair charge of the type that the hon lady describe we will consult this year on implement the act new consumer protection provision for the million home that be subject to those charge we be committed to bring those measure into force as quickly as possible thousand of my constituent in stratford on avon now live in so call fleecehold development often with lack of transparency in how service charge be set and lack of maintenance of public open space include drainage infrastructure will the minister reassure my constituent that any leasehold reform will include tackle fleecehold and that the reform will be apply retrospectively can assure the hon lady that we will tackle the injustice of fleecehold as part of the ambitious change that we intend to make to the leasehold system with view to bring it to an end in this parliament the consumer protection provision in the act which have already mention will ensure that homeowner who pay an estate management charge will have well access to the information that they need to challenge the reasonableness of charge at the first tier tribunal there be other power as part of those protection and as have say we will consult on they shortly and bring they into force as quickly as possible thereafter topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility my no priority be to get britain build again we will build baby build that mean put britain on path to end the moral stain of homelessness and rough sleeping that double under the previous conservative government grow our economy with good secure job and rise income in every region of britain and put the key to home ownership in the hand of more people across our country under the conservatives the british dream of home ownership become nightmare and out of reach but with this labour government it will become reality once more my constituent in oldham east and saddleworth be delighted to learn that oldham have receive million award from the pride in place programme will the secretary of state expand on the transformational change that the award will mean to place like oldham where government support be decimate under the conservatives in particular what difference will be make by local people have say in how the money will be spend thank my hon friend the chair of the work and pensions committee for her work in support disadvantaged neighbourhood in oldham and her strong support for the pride in place programme which offer significant amount of long term flexible funding and support to area like oldham good of all it be local people who will take the decision about what the investment need to look like to make real difference to their high street public service and public transport so that they can take back pride in the place they belong call the shadow secretary of state nobody but nobody believe that million home will be build under this government although the minister for local government and homelessness the hon member for birkenhead alison mcgovern spend lot of time at the dispatch box she do not answer the question about whether the treasury will be ask to scrap stamp duty we know that million people say that they would consider downsize if stamp duty be abolish free up family home of all size she would not answer so ask the secretary of state directly will he ask the treasury to scrap stamp duty yes or no know that the right hon gentleman be strong supporter of liz truss when she stand for leadership of the conservative party but surely he can not have forget what she do she make multibillion pound unfunded spending commitment that crash the economy and send wage down and price mortgage and rent skyrocket the last thing this country need be ten of billion of pound of more unfunded commitment crash the economy again and destroy people dream of home ownership order there be lot of back benchers who wish to speak and this be topical question call the shadow secretary of state ask for simple yes or no but the right hon gentleman struggle to give that the truth be that we have outline exactly where the money could come from and we have make it clear that if those on the labour front bench have the gut to take on their back benchers they will have the support of conservative members in make the expenditure cut that be need the london school of economics have estimate that of economic activity come with every house purchase so if he will not agree to cut stamp duty will he at least agree to not put up property taxis have to say again that the right hon gentleman devotion to trussonomics be admirable particularly give that we have already see it fail once we hear from the shadow chancellor that the conservatives would put up income tax if they win the general election they put it up to the high level since the second world war we be not go there tory cut to local authority cruelly cause lasting damage to many community what contrast to the government pride in place programme award to park end and thorntree in middlesbrough which will change life for the well do the secretary of state agree that council tax equalisation and new child formula be essential element to fully deliver for those community that be totally overlook by the conservatives it be important that we get that right and we will have further discussion about it shortly might disagree with my hon friend on the importance of pride in place which will turn around some of the decline create by the conservative party call the liberal democrat spokesperson in june the department make the welcome announcement of legislation to allow proxy voting and remote attendance which will help to drive up the diversity of councillor across the country but the government have not yet set out timeline will the minister advise the house on when timeline will be share and whether the government have consider include the change in the english devolution and community empowerment bill the government be commit to an election bill which will be come in due course very shortly imagine and be sure the hon member will be able to explore those issue far at that time in tory run dudley council enter an agreement with social housing developer but later pull the plug and sell off the land so we may not get those much need home what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that council maximise opportunity to build affordable and social home on land own by council be sorry to learn about the loss of social rent home in that instance can assure my hon friend that the government be commit to reinvigorate council house building and direct her attention to the five point plan that we publish in july to deliver decade of renewal for social and affordable housing whether essex end up with three four or five authority under the local government reform my constituent will certainly come under an authority that be no long local as part of the reform will more power be devolve to town and parish council that be able to understand and properly reflect their local resident local government reorganisation will create opportunity to improve public service efficiency and clarity the final proposal from council in essex be submit by september and we anticipate launch statutory consultation in november be sure we will discuss the right hon gentleman point in detail over the week and month to come across the sheffield city council

and those across the authority can stay near but go far as iterate early we want to see more empty home bring back into use in sheffield and across the country as we outline in the english devolution white paper we intend to strengthen the ability of local authority such as sheffield city council to take over the management of vacant residential premise we in leicestershire have three if not four plan for our reorganisation with no agreement we also have county council run by reform which have already have not one but two reshuffle lose its cabinet lead for social service and finance while of its budget be spend on social service and special educational need and disability what assurance can the government give that my constituent will get those service and that those service will be

bank less than month ago people tell and tend to agree with they that nobody know how those shop will sustain an income to keep they go what be the government do to take on rogue trader my hon friend be completely right to raise this issue that be why we be give local community great power to control the proliferation of gambling and vape shop it be also why through our pride in place programme we

democrat control waverley borough council for the apparent crime of build home extension meet the housing minister early this year to talk about abuse of the community infrastructure levy could he

way in which we can do that be to build more home of all tenure which be precisely what we be commit to do we can also boost the supply of social and affordable housing which our social and affordable housing programme worth billion over year will do winter be come and nearly million household be live in fuel poverty which be an absolute scandal the long await warm home plan can not come soon

constituent can be sure that any development be safe and take account of climate implication thank my hon friend for bring that matter to my attention he be right that can not comment on individual

economic imperative to unlock the growth prospect across the country and the reorganisation process which be be do to ensure that we have more streamlined and effective public service we be do those in tandem because the last government fail to get grip of local government structure and the funding pressure across the piece we be get on with it and we be drive it forward both process be be drive with huge collaboration from local authority across the country thank the secretary of state for take the decision to invest million through the pride in place scheme in my constituency for year two

want to join stamford but the council be press ahead with an unwanted leicestershire merger resident of south kesteven do not want to join mega lincolnshire council but be be push towards it and in leicestershire my constituent do not want leicester city takeover what reassurance will the government give that democracy will not die under these reform and that local people voice will be hear can certainly confirm that democracy will not die know that official in the department will have hear what the hon lady have say and will accept her question as representation on the issue of local government in my kind and inclusive city of york those who be put up flag and express support for they have be embolden to perpetrate racism and intimidate community they have beat people up and hang death threat on our city wall what further support can the government give my local authority to enable it to get those flag down give that even contractor be be intimidate the flag be something that we must reclaim and reclaim proudly we know that in some community flag be be use to intimidate and divide and we be work with local authority throughout the country to ensure that they have the support that they need to make those judgment call but return to the fact that the flag be ours we need to reclaim it and we need to stand up against those who want to divide our community across the country the proceeds of crime act be never intend to be use by local authority as an addendum to planning enforcement the secretary of state may well have see recent medium report about this issue will he undertake to look into it and to issue guidance to local authority explain that while they have many tool at their disposal the proceed of crime act be not one of they the hon gentleman have raise an important point and be happy to arrange meeting with the appropriate minister so that he can share his concern and we can come to resolution manchester terrorism attack with permission mr speaker will make statement about the terrorist attack on october and the action that the government be take in response let start by call this attack what it be an evil act of antisemitic terrorism that target innocent worshipper on yom kippur the holy day in the jewish calendar which be carry out by terrorist pledge his allegiance to the warped ideology of islamism pay tribute to the two man who be kill on that day melvin cravitz and adrian daulby their bravery save countless life on behalf of the whole house offer my deep sympathy to their family and their friend may their memory be blessing further three man be seriously injure in the attack know that all our thought be with they and with all those who be catch up in these terrible event also wish to thank those whose bravery save life worshipper staff and volunteer from the community security trust and the emergency service who act with speed and the utmost professionalism this be moment of profound national sorrow an attack on our jewish community be an attack on this entire nation and it call on we to assert once more our determination to tackle extremism antisemitism and hatred wherever they appear although the event of that day be painful to recount it be important that we do so on the morning of thursday october terrorist drive car at worshipper outside the heaton park hebrew congregation synagogue in crumpsall manchester the driver then leave his vehicle arm with knife and resume his attack he be wear what be later determined to be fake explosive device although it should be remember that all present have every reason to believe that that bomb be real when the first call to the emergency service come in greater manchester police declare major incident and firearm officer be deploy within seven minute of that call the attacker have be intercept and shoot dead melvin cravitz be kill by the attacker tragically initial finding now indicate that adrian daulby sustain gunshot wound during the armed police response as be standard in such case an investigation be be carry out by the independent office of police conduct but there be two thing that can say first it be important to note that the iopc have confirm that the officer involve in the response be be treat as witness secondly it must be remember that the police act in situation in which they believe terrorist be likely to detonate an explosive device the necessary process must now take their course and expect the iopc to complete they as quickly as possible there be no ambiguity around who be responsible for the death and injury that take place on that day member will be aware that the attack be carry out by jihad al shamie year old british citizen of syrian descent we know that he come to this country as child and be register as british citizen while still minor he be never refer to the prevent programme nor be he know to counter terrorism policing or the security service he have however recently be arrest on rape charge for which he be on bail at the time of the attack investigator believe the attacker be influence by extreme islamist ideology evident in call that he make during the incident in which he pledge allegiance to islamic state six people be arrest follow the attack and be release without charge one be subsequently re arrest and have be bail know that there be many question that the public rightly demand answer to as do members of this house those answer will come but for now the investigation be ongoing and we must allow that work to take its course we know that voice in the jewish community have long be warn that this day would come and that jews who have long feel safe in this country in their country now no long do now that this awful day have come to pass we must learn from it so that we do everything within our power to ensure that it do not happen again our immediate priority be to enhance security visible officer patrol have be step up at synagogue and other site in manchester and across the country additional support have be make available to more than location and although there have be long stand security arrangement in place with million of funding each year for the community security trust it be clear that more must be do we will provide our jewish community with the protection they deserve because no one should be force to live small jewish life in their country because of the event of october our posture at religious site be one of maximum vigilance that apply to the jewish community and it also apply to british muslims know that member from across the house will have be disturb by suspect arson attack that take place at mosque in peacehaven east sussex last week the policing minister visit the mosque and meet those who be force to flee for their life in terrifying circumstance and we have discuss this with my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown and peacehaven chris ward who know also visit the mosque on friday let be clear violence direct at any community be they jewish or muslim and of all faith or none be an attack on our entire country know this country be unite in our condemnation of those who seek to divide we because one of the great achievement of this country have be our tolerance our ability to accept and embrace difference and our generosity towards those who may not look the same but be encompass comfortably within single national identity it be for that reason that be so affront by the protest that take place in the day after the attack these be clear source of fear to the jewish community who be grieve just day after an unspeakable tragedy the same be true on the anniversary of the october attack describe those protest as un british and stand by that because those protester show none of the generosity of spirit that love about this country and they most certainly do their cause no good whatsoever the right to protest be fundamental freedom but it must be balance against the right the public have to their safety and security in my conversation with community leader and the police in recent day it be clear that balance have not be strike for that reason can confirm to the house today that we will amend section and of the public order act the police will be able to take account of the cumulative impact of frequent protest when consider whether to impose condition this will mean that protest that follow the same route time and again can be force to change their route or the time of protest be also review all exist legislation to ensure our public order power be fit for purpose and be be consistently apply the right to protest must and will be protect but of all the freedom we enjoy none be more precious than the right to live in safety the government first responsibility be to keep the public safe since the security service and the police have disrupt more than plot and this work have save countless life through our counter terrorism strategy contest we continue to tackle threat to this country include those pose by islamist terrorism which remain our primary domestic threat through programme such as prevent we seek to stop the slide into extremism that be draw in far too many young people today once the investigation into this attack be complete we will know much more about how it take place but the reality be we now face domestic terrorist threat in this country that be more complex less predictable and hard to detect than ever before that threat will never be defeat unless we address the hate that fuel it that mean act on the rise tide of antisemitism in this country be horrified when hear our jewish community talk about their fear in country that once offer rare island of sanctuary in an all too often hostile world we have in the day since the attack step up our effort to tackle antisemitism wherever it be find challenging misinformation and hatred in school call on vice chancellor to do more to protect jewish student at university and call on local authority to use their power to protect the community as well as review the clearly inadequate regulation that protect jewish staff and patient in the national health service while these be important step more must be do antisemitism be the old hatred and we must now redouble our effort to fight it once more terrorist seek one thing to divide we they hate society like ours where different community live together in harmony unite by common identity that transcend the colour of our skin or the nature of our faith this attack have raise question that must be answer about the security that we provide to our jewish community about how we address rise tide of antisemitism and about how we bring community together rather than allow some individual to separate off into dark corner include how we tackle the continue threat of islamist extremism and those who be pull towards its warped ideology however at the same time we must not let this attack defeat we nor forget who we really be because the real face of this country be not that of the vile monster who conduct this attack it be those who stand up to he and save their fellow worshipper and the emergency service who sprint towards danger to bring the attack to an end the real face of this country be not those who take to the street and protest the very next day but rather those who be horrify by the attack stand with their jewish neighbour and choose the path of solidarity over division the antisemitic terrorist attack of october be horrifying act in response to it hope the whole house can be unite in simple message those who seek to divide we by pit one against another will fail no act of terror will ever defeat we commend this statement to the house call the shadow home secretary thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement at am on the morning of yom kippur the holy day in the jewish calendar we see the sicken terrorist attack on worshipper at heaton park synagogue in manchester by an islamist extremist the brutal attack leave two man dead melvin cravitz and adrian daulby and three more injured our thought and prayer remain with the victim and their family whose life be so wickedly tear apart on that holy morning want to thank greater manchester police and other in the security and emergency service for respond so quickly and the brave worshipper inside the synagogue who stop the attacker from enter join the home secretary in say that hope the iopc complete its work quickly and that its conclusion reflect the fact that the police officer act with courage in what be very dangerous unpredictable and fast move situation sadly we know that antisemitism be at record high in the uk the community security trust record over antisemitic incident across the uk in the first half of this year the second high level ever and jewish people in our country tragically face far high rate of hate crime than any other community we must stand with this country jewish community and fight with all our resolve and energy the ancient evil of antisemitism wherever it be find it have no place on these shore not ever to be clear attack base on race or religion be totally unacceptable the recent attack on mosque in peacehaven be appal and know that we all unreservedly condemn it everyone in this country in all community include the muslim community must have the courage to stand up to extremism wherever we see it stand by and say nothing when encounter extremism be complicity that be why the antisemitism that be rife on university campus must also be fight the home secretary mention that in her statement but will she work with her colleague in government to withdraw funding from university that do not do enough to fight antisemitism we must do more than just call out extremism anyone espouse extremist view or who express support for terrorism or racial or religious hatred of any kind include antisemitism who be not british citizen should be remove from this country will the home secretary commit today to use her power under the immigration act to remove from this country any foreign national who express extremist view or sympathy for political violence terrorism antisemitism or any other form of religious hatred whether or not the criminal threshold be meet she could make that commitment now will she show that she be serious about fight extremism by do so agree with the home secretary that the protest on october this year the anniversary of the terrorist murder by hamas and just day after the manchester attack be british in her word which agree with the protest have continue even after the recent peace agreement relate to gaza be sign and of course they start before israel military action in gaza in principle support her propose introduction of new cumulative impact test to section and of the public order act but will she also consider expand that test to also account for intimidation feel by other community as result of protest do the home secretary also agree that anyone express support for proscribe terrorist organisation or who incite violence for example by call for jihad or intifada should be arrest and prosecute since the attack the police confirm the attacker pledge allegiance to islamic state and be influence by extreme islamist ideology as the home secretary acknowledge islamist extremism be sadly threat we know all too well in the united kingdom in july we remember the people murder by islamist terrorist in the bombing which take place year ago the deadly terrorist attack commit on british soil we also remember sir david amess also murder by an islamist extremist and the victim of the manchester arena attack also murder by an islamist extremist we should not be afraid to call out this extremist ideology wherever we see it it have no place in this country will the home secretary pledge to drop any definition of islamophobia that would make call out islamist extremism any hard the fact be that of terrorism relate caseload be relate to islamist extremism and the vast majority of terrorist murder in the past year be perpetrate by islamists yet only of the prevent caseload be islamist related what do the home secretary propose to do about that britain give perpetrator jihad al shamie home when he arrive here from syria he then carry out brutal attack on synagogue deliberately target at jewish people on the holy day of the jewish calendar we need to reflect very deeply on the implication of that today we must all stand together and fight the hatred of extremism and terror attack like this one be an attack on our whole nation we will never change our way of life and we will never allow our fellow citizen to be threaten or attack simply because of their background know that the whole house will want to send out that message today thank the shadow home secretary for his response and for the way in which he make it look forward to work with he and with all member across the house as we deal with what hope will always be shared issue and shared problem where there be agreement and consensus in this house on the measure that we should take hope we will be able to progress those matter quickly the shadow home secretary ask specifically about university he will hope have see the comment make by my colleague and right hon friend the secretary of state for education who have make clear to university what their responsibility be it be important that she do that engagement before consider what measure to take if university fail to take all step to protect jewish student on campus this government be very clear that university already have responsibility and they need to demonstrate that they be reflect those responsibility and take appropriate action the shadow home secretary ask range of question on other crime that be be commit he will hope recognise that this government have work very closely with policing despite lot of disquiet in some quarter to ensure that we have absolutely no tail off in our response to those who support proscribe terror organisation he will have see that there have be many hundred of arrest as long as people continue to show support for proscribe organisation they will face the full force of the law every time they do so on immigration power be consider all immigration issue the shadow home secretary will know that this government have quite significantly increase the deportation of foreign offender who have be find guilty of commit crime in this country compare to the situation we inherit note his point on the wide power of the immigration act which be review will say more to the house on that in due course the right hon gentleman also make number of point on our propose amendment to section and of the public order act hope that when we bring those measure forward they will receive support in this house be happy to write to he on any further detail about the public order act be go to review the wide landscape of public order legislation particularly in relation to the cumulative impact of repeat protest we be already go to take step on impose further condition and make explicit that cumulative impact be something that the police should take into account but be also go to look at the wide framework again will return to the house in due course with further update on that legislation the shadow home secretary rightly note that the protest have continue both before and after the peace agreement in the middle east think we can conclude that not all those protest truly wish to see peace in the middle east but it be for they to answer on what their motivation really be we be very clear that although the right to protest be fundamental freedom in our country enjoy by people of all background it be often the cause of grave offence to other people who live in this country and it must be balance against the right of all people to be able to live in safety the shadow home secretary mention islamist extremism in particular let be clear to he and to the house that this government and as home secretary have clear eyed view of where the threat that face this country be come from it be true that within our domestic extremism landscape the large cohort of work that keep our security service and counter terror police busy be relate to islamist extremism we will not shy away from confront those issue and deal with they in the appropriate way what happen in manchester on october ask big question of all of we this threat be something that we have be live with for some time and we have not yet defeat it commit myself and the government to do everything in our power to stand up to this particular threat without fear or favour and to destroy it for good also note that the first people that islamist often suppress hurt and damage be their fellow muslims it be in everyone interest to fight islamist extremism wherever it be find as the shadow home secretary note there be wide and more complex domestic extremism picture in relation to extreme right wing terrorism and the emerge threat of those who do not have fixed ideology but who be fixate on violence it be important that all of our response be measure and follow where the risk be come from and that we be always ask ourselves what action will ultimately be effective in deal with the threat we will redouble our effort to interrogate the assumption that have be make in the past and to assess whether they need to be change and what new effective action must be pursue hope that in that task we will have support from member across the house thank the home secretary for her statement and be sure that the people of crumpsall where this atrocity take place will welcome it the only point would add be that while these act of antisemitism and violence be un british they be also inhuman think that be well way to describe they rather than un british thank the home secretary and the prime minister for come to manchester on the day of the attack which be much appreciated the home secretary have chance to meet the hero because while there be violence and tragedy there be certainly hero not least the member of the congregation two of whom lose their life who protect other member of the congregation from what would undoubtedly have be more death the home secretary also meet the community security trust the police and the fire brigade who all play an excellent role in get to the site of the violence as quickly as they could have live in this community within stone throw of the synagogue for most of my adult life and have no doubt that the community will remain resilient it have always be resilient the film crew who throng about the area after the violence be amazed that muslims jews sikhs christians and people of no religion be all console each other there be no hostility at all on the street the final point want to make be not as heartwarming there be hurt and anger within the local jewish community they have know for some time that an attack like this be come obviously they do not know when or where but it have arrive they feel that there have develop hierarchy of racism that somehow jew hatred be not as important as other kind of racism they feel that not enough have be do to protect they the extra security that the prime minister and the home secretary have announce be welcome but what the community be look for be extra action to deal with religious extremist who be involve in illegal activity to get to the heart of the violent activity against the jewish community the final point will make be that in one sense take action against illegal activity be the easy part but partly because of what have happen in gaza many people now think it be okay in casual dinner party conversation we have probably all hear it and witness it to make antisemitic comment it be not okay it be also not okay although it be not against the law for artist if can use that word like bob vylan to be operate and spread their hate on campus like manchester university will the home secretary look forward with to future not only free of antisemitism but where do not have to walk or drive past jewish school with security guard outside they pay tribute to my hon friend who be an assiduous constituency member of parliament see for myself at first hand his deep link in the community that he represent in the house and how he have be source of real strength in bring people together in that part of manchester as member of an ethnic and faith minority myself one of the thing that most hate about our political discourse and national conversation be the hierarchy of racism hate how minority community feel like we be pit against one another in fight for attention and recognition of the difficulty that we might face as individual group racism in all its form be abhorrent and will be as assiduous in fight the scourge of antisemitism in this country as people might expect as muslim to be in fight islamophobia in this country we be all safe when we be all safe and will not stand by and watch our community be force to compete with one another and force to explain again and again why they be suffer and why they do not feel safe to that be unacceptable in century britain will not stand for it and it will not be the policy position of this government the person who bear responsibility for what happen on october be the terrorist attacker himself will not name he again today but there be no doubt that event in the middle east have cause tension here at home and some have seek to exploit those tension it be incredibly important that we be clear eyed in hold the line between what could be legitimate critique of the israeli government action in the war in the middle east and antisemitism you can be critic of policy in the middle east without become antisemitic hat jews and hold jews in this country to account for thing happen in country elsewhere that be nothing to do with they it be incumbent on all of we to hold that line and to be clear where that line be so that we speak with one voice and give confidence to our minority community here at home one of the most devastating thing that hear when be in manchester on the day and in the aftermath of the attack be our jewish community express how they now feel unsafe in their own country and that they might never see time when their child do not have to have security when they go to school although it be important that in the immediate aftermath of the attack we consider security matter enhance the police presence and deepen our work with the community security trust will not stop until people in this country can go to synagogue or jewish school without first have to go through security cordon call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the home secretary for advance sight of her statement this be my first duty as my party home affair spokesperson only wish that it be not in response to such tragedy my party thought be with the family of adrian daulby and melvin cravitz who be tragically kill our thought be also with those who be injure the congregation and the wide jewish community which be the target of vicious attack on its holy day yom kippur we must all be clear that the attack do not happen in vacuum antisemitism be widespread on britain street and british jews have be live in fear particularly since hamas horrific terror attack of october the liberal democrats be commit to ensure that our jewish friend and neighbour feel safe walk the street and worship in their synagogue those who spread antisemitic hatred or incite violence against jews whether online at march or elsewhere must be stop that be never acceptable thank the community security trust as the shadow home secretary do for the incredible job that it do work with the police to protect the jewish community across our country praise its collaboration with organisation such as tell mama with which it share good practice so that both the jewish community and the muslim community can be well protect look forward to visit the cst headquarters in the near future as one of my first duty in this role we can not ignore the issue of protest the right to peaceful protest be cornerstone of our democracy and it be right that the liberal democrats will always protect but we be also acutely aware of the fear feel by the jewish community and the harassment that they have feel at some march too often we have see march hijack by people spread antisemitism and incite violence against jews we see it even on the night of this appalling attack my party be unequivocal in its view that those who incite antisemitism and carry it out must be meet with the full force of the law say this advisedly mr speaker unfortunately the government recent decision have lead to police arrest pensioner for hold up cardboard sign when they should be protect all community include the jewish community from those who would cause harm this undermine the right to protest and crucially mean that the police be use their time and resource on other thing when they should be protect people the british jewish community should not have to suffer violence or live in fear simply because of their identity we need less thought and prayer and more action will the home secretary confirm what additional physical security the home office have provide for the jewish community since the attack we must also tackle the underlying root of modern day antisemitism in this country if the conversation we have make we feel squeamish and lead we to ask question that prompt discomforting answer as question that have ask recently have do that be all the more reason to have they and to have they more often will the home secretary with the prime minister convene summit of interfaith leader communal body education head and the security service to really get grip of the ever grow crisis of antisemitism antisemitism terrorism and hatred can be defeat but only if we stand united against they and stand for the value that we as british people hold so dear thank the liberal democrat spokesman for his response where we agree hope we will be able to work closely in particular on issue relate to protest and rebuild interfaith work in this country think everybody who have be involve in interfaith work in the last two year myself include will acknowledge that there have be real challenge and difficulty there we have to think more creatively and redouble our effort to rebuild relationship that have be deeply strained however can not accept and leave unchallenged what the hon member have to say about the protest lead primarily by the group defend our juries in relation to the proscription of the group palestine action think the liberal democrats have to ask themselves some serious question be they go to stand up for the rule of law in this country in this house and outside it anyone be free to challenge our terror law to say that they should be change and to suggest that the threshold be in the wrong place and need update that be fair and legitimate comment we may disagree but it be perfectly legitimate to debate that in this house and outside it what be not acceptable and what be crime under the law of our land be to support proscribe organisation member of this house should not feel that they can do anything other than support the law of our land it do not matter whether someone think proscription be the wrong thing to do support proscribe organisation be an offence under our terror law and it will always be meet with the full force of the law do say to the liberal democrats that they really have to decide whether they be go to stand up for the rule of law in this country if they have thing to say suggestion or amendment about our terror law they should raise they in the normal and legitimate way in the house but do not break the rule of law in our country interruption think the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart who be speak from sedentary position be suggest that he think that police the protest where support for proscribe organisation be show be somehow waste of time call it stand up for the rule of law in this country be sure the whole house will share my joy at the release of the hostage in the middle east today but as the shocking attack in manchester last week show and as the home secretary and my hon friend the member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer make absolutely clear antisemitism be rife and increase on our own doorstep therefore ask the home secretary to increase funding for police and security not only at synagogue but at jewish school like brodetsky primary and leeds jewish free school as well as at the zone youth club in my leeds north east constituency will she also consider fund essential and crucial community organisation such as the leeds jewish representative council that be fundamental to community cohesion in leeds and other city be sure that the whole house share the relief at the release of the hostage after such long period in captivity have see their family go through so much be sure that we all hope and pray that the peace process in the middle east properly get under way and that we will see long term resolution as quickly as possible we have already increase the police presence at synagogue and other site of interest and community institution for the jewish community all across the country we be in discussion with the community security trust and other community organisation about what the future look like in term of security and other issue we will report to the house in due course call the chair of the home affairs committee thank the home secretary for her statement and for advance sight of it while be very supportive of the work that be be do to increase security at jewish synagogue and other venue the answer can not be constantly more security for the jewish community the jewish community need to be able to live their life fully as the home secretary say so what step be she take to address the extremist ideology of the perpetrator it be present online in school and in mosque it be addle brain and make people do utterly horrendous thing such as those we see last week the chair of the select committee be absolutely right the answer can not just be more funding for more security as say in response to an early question do not want it to be forever the case that in order for jewish child to go to their local jewish school they have to walk through security cordon think it be right that in our initial response to the attack we be focus on security because it be important that we give confidence to the community who have see such horrific terror attack take place but the future have to look different from the present and the past that be why the government be go to step up our action on tackle antisemitism work closely with the independent adviser lord mann we have set up an antisemitism working group which will make wide societal recommendation in due course it be why the secretary of state for education have write to university in particular to remind they of their responsibility to student action be already take place base on our current arrangement but there be question for we to ask about the wide picture and how we really deal with the scourge of antisemitism it have go on for far too long it be rise and as society we need to think more carefully and more deeply about how we tackle that hatred and how we bring all our community together the perpetrator of the hideous antisemitic terror attack on the jewish community at the heaton park shul be on police bail for rape at the time of the attack join long line of terrorist and violent extremist with document history of violence against woman and girl welcome the measure that the home secretary have outline today to provide great protection for our jewish community in the wake of the attack alongside that will the home secretary outline whether any work be take place into misogyny as risk factor for or nexus into other form of extremism within our anti terrorism framework and what plan the government have to publish an extremism strategy and hate crime action plan my hon friend be right the attacker be at the time of the attack on police bail for two different charge of rape all previous contact he have with the police be subject to an iopc investigation there be two plank to the iopc investigation the first be the shooting itself but then there be the attacker previous contact with the police once we have that part of the iopc work complete will be able to give much more detail about the exact nature of those allege offence why he be deal with in the way that he be and if there be any wide lesson to be draw from that assure she that the nexus of misogyny with extremism be something that this government take very seriously be join on the front bench by the minister for victims my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones from the ministry of justice with whom we work closely on these matter assure my hon friend the member for warrington north charlotte nichols that our next publication will focus if possible if the investigation have take place on the lesson that have be learn from this case call the father of the house of course we all agree with the home secretary but can we dig little deep there be reason why the jewish community be by far our most successful immigrant community date from the end of the century they be determined and be determined to integrate into our society in every single way but let we be realistic there be some part of some community who do not integrate will the government say unequivocally that if someone want to come and live here they must think of themselves primarily as british it do not matter what their colour or faith be they be british however strongly they feel about gaza or anything else they must approach all issue with our traditional sense of good humour and tolerance think everyone across the house can agree and unite around the idea that it be important that everybody who come to this country make it their home and choose to raise their family here commit themselves to be the good of british that be certainly my own experience as somebody whose parent come to this country in the late and then in the actually the vast majority of our minority community be very proud of be british every survey have ever see of minority community that ask they to describe their britishness find huge pride in britishness and also in our union jack our flag and symbol of our nation there be obviously though some issue that we have to confront there be question to be ask here about this attacker who have all of the benefit he come here as small child and become naturalised british citizen he be still minor when he become british and he commit these attack in his there be question to ask about what go wrong in that period of his life in those formative year that make he do such an act will ensure that those wide lesson be learn and will never shy away from honest conversation about either integration or community cohesion in our country but also do not want it to be the case that we allow the action of minority to make we believe that our majority be not proud of be british because my own experience and all the datum show that the exact opposite be true thank the home secretary for her statement and her visit to manchester immediately follow the attack in the jewish community in my constituency in south manchester there be real sense of anxiety and fear and she be right to identify that the message that need to go out today and that have go out across manchester be that the people of manchester be shock and appal by this attack and stand with our jewish neighbour against antisemitism and extremism number of my constituent in manchester withington have ask to press the home secretary to ensure that the community security trust and other community organisation get the full support they need not just security which be obviously important but trauma service and mental health support could she say little more about that and give they that reassurance the volunteer of the community security trust be absolute hero and do vital work every single day they be there at the site of the attack and the action of those volunteer and worshipper at the synagogue in manchester on october save many many life so many people be cower behind the door to the synagogue keep it shut and prevent the attacker from enter can not imagine what must they have go through while they do so but they do so to keep other safe they be all hero have be very strike by the conversation that have have with those volunteer assure my hon friend that and the prime minister have have constant contact with the community security trust and other jewish community organisation we will say more in the come day and week about how we intend to move forward on matter of security and about the wide picture of give reassurance to this country jewish community so that they can go about their business safely first on behalf of the scottish national party join the home secretary in express our solidarity with the jewish community after the horror of the appalling event at the heaton park synagogue such antisemitic hate must never be allow to prevail or divide we in scotland the police have increase security in our centre of faith and have ask the public to remain vigilant follow the attack however do the home secretary not see that by crack down on our legitimate right to protest she be simply give succour to the hater allow they to dictate our approach to protest and to alter basic freedom that we have always enjoy surely that can not be the government intention the government intention be to ensure that the right balance be strike between our fundamental right to protest and ensure that our community can go about their business without live in fear of weekly protest on their doorstep through amendment to section and of the public order act we be suggest make it explicit that the police can take cumulative impact into account when impose condition that be not removal of the right to protest it be just say that there be condition the protest can carry on but not in way that prevent other community from be able to go about their business in safety and security be surprised well be not surprised because the hon gentleman be from the scottish national party but hope that member across the house understand that get the balance right be delicate and difficult and that this measure will put we back toward something that look and feel much more like balanced situation protest can go ahead but with some condition would be surprised if that do not get backing from across the house hope that it do during my time in and around public life manchester have face number of terrorist atrocity the and ira bomb the death of detective constable stephen oake in at the hand of an islamic extremist the manchester arena terror attack and now this vile attack on manchester jewish community be the home secretary confident that we have fully implement the recommendation on tackle the failing identify after the arena attack and that there be an equitable distribution of counter terrorism resource in the united kingdom when visit soon after the attack be very clear that the main finding from the arena attack relate to the ability of the emergency service to respond in timely way and therefore save life can tell my hon friend that between they the emergency service the fire service the police the ambulance service and everybody else take on board the direct learning from what happen in the arena attack only seven minute pass between moment the first call come in and the moment the attacker be shoot dead so pay direct tribute to all those emergency service role be play not just by armed police but by the ambulance service and the fire service fire service happen to be go to different fire but they re rout to deal with the aftermath of the attack pay tribute to they those be direct learning from the arena attack on the wide picture we will know more about the preparation and planning of the attack once all the fact be in will inform my hon friend and other in the house if think there be wide lesson to be draw but it be little early in the investigation to say whether there be as in the case of the attack on parliament in this attack be combination of the use of vehicle as deadly weapon and an attempt to break into premise to kill people indiscriminately on both occasion brave man have to sacrifice their life to prevent access would it not be sensible first step for all vulnerable premise to have door that can be easily lock so that people do not have to put themselves at risk physically hold they close congratulate the home secretary on an excellent statement thank the right hon gentleman for his question and comment he be right there be wide learning here that be why the government be implement martyn law which be about make premise safe from attack and draw on lesson from the manchester arena attack that be due to be implement know there be some concern in the house and elsewhere in the jewish and other community about the length of time for implementation which be up to month will make sure that we interrogate whether that implementation can occur more quickly if it can will ensure that it do as greater manchester member of parliament proudly represent significant jewish community know how much fear and anguish there already be in the community even before the horrific attack in crumpsall as manchester colleague have say as the home secretary have outline we need action not word to tackle the scourge of rise antisemitism can the government update the house on the development of our counter extremism strategy have we respond to previous finding in this regard for instance the review conduct by dame sara khan my hon friend be right he will have note my early comment about immediate action that the government be take as well as the wide message to partner across the public sector at university in the nhs and so on that we all need to do more to tackle the scourge of antisemitism in our country on counter terror policy more broadly be myself review all the previous finding make by expert follow early attack under the previous government and our own to make sure that we have implement all relevant recommendation and that our response be alive to the scale of the challenge be very clear that this attack have ask big question of all of we of the country and the government specifically about the response to antisemitism and integration and community cohesion those issue will be subject to further lively debate in this house in the week and month to come may take this rare opportunity to praise the home secretary for what she have do with palestine action and for take step to preserve the ability of some to protest while stop hate speech and other action from other protester do she agree that there be correlation between the rise of antisemitism and these protest the jewish community in london but also be sure across manchester and the rest of the uk be afraid to be comfortable in their religion they feel afraid even to wear yarmulke or to identify as jewish that be national disgrace and hope that the home secretary will move forward to tackle it with not just word but action have be clear that do not want people in our country our own citizen to feel that they have to live small life and hide away who they really be because they be afraid of attack be it verbal or physical or scar that their child will be abuse that be not the future that want for anyone in our country not in our jewish community or any other community that be why have take step on protest and be review the wide legislation on protest and the threshold for hate crime have be hear clearly in the last few day that there be particular phrase that may not be liable for prosecution under our legislation but that create huge amount of fear want to review all that properly in the round to make sure that we have the most robust legal framework framework that allow people in our country their effective precious freedom and accept that people sometimes say offensive thing but provide clear line between what be offensive and what be criminal once have complete that review will report to the house thank the home secretary for her excellent statement pay tribute to the man who be kill and send my condolence to their family and friend and the wide jewish community as the home secretary have say there be no place whatsoever in the uk for hate crime of any sort direct at any group or any individual and those who propagate hate must be hold to account the home secretary propose change to the regulation in the public order act in addition will she undertake review of the online safety act use of the online space be key way in which message of hate be propagate and not enough be be do to stop that my hon friend be right to point out that hatred against minority community run riot in the online space we do not need to look that deeply at many of the group that proliferate online to see that whatever other hatred they say they profess underneath there be usually cesspit of antisemitism that be huge problem for we the online safety act have measure that be design to begin to address some of those problem but be sure that there will be more work for we to do in the future we must first ensure that our legal framework be robust enough to tackle the threat that we see daily in our real world space and then review to ensure that there be action much early in the online space will talk to colleague across government to ensure that we do everything that we can thank the home secretary for her statement and join she in express solidarity with the jewish community follow the horrific attack do the home secretary agree that we must urgently address online space where hatred be radicalise and amplify will she work with the secretary of state for science innovation and technology to review ofcom guidance and the categorisation set out in the online safety act to ensure that small high harm platform be properly regulate to prevent the radicalisation that lead to such devastating attack the hon lady will understand that will not make new policy at the dispatch box but confirm that will be talk about those matter to the secretary of state for science innovation and technology recognise that the online space pose specific challenge when it come to all form of hatred particularly antisemitism which proliferate across the political spectrum on the left on the right and everywhere in between and will talk to colleague in government about that tonight jews around the world begin the festival of simchat torah on simchat torah two year ago we witness the bad attack on jews since world war two today we express joy at the hostage release but also great sorrow at the massive loss of life during this terrible war as we have hear antisemitism be widespread there be often only one jewish child at rural school in say norfolk or suffolk indeed my brother and be the only jewish child at our school what can be do to support our teacher so that they have the skill knowledge and curriculum to educate all our child on the terrible scourge of antisemitism the department for education and the secretary of state for education have already make funding available to school to tackle antisemitism in the classroom and to educate teacher about the good way to handle conversation on the subject be sure that she will say more about that when she be next before the house for oral question my hon friend should rest assure that we recognise that antisemitism be society wide problem colleague in the department of health be take action particularly around the regulation of doctor to ensure that our national health service be safe space for patient of every background include jewish patient there have be work not just in the department for education but in other departments there need to be whole government response because this be whole society problem in the wake of the terrorist attack in heaton park be very proud to say that belmont shul in my constituency host shabbat service follow meeting of the harrow interfaith council at which representative of all religion stand together with the jewish community to say that hatred will not be allow to win on the previous friday however be horrify to receive frantic phone call just before shabbat start say that none of the synagogue have have contact from the police about what would happen the follow day after some frantic phone call the police say we can do drive bys and various other thing but we can have permanent presence at the shul on shabbat the reason be the palestine action demonstration in central london at which the police know they would have to arrest perpetrator support proscribe organisation my constituent and those across london be feed up with pay for these hate march and hate demonstration to take place in addition to change the route the meeting place and the time that these demonstration can take place how about another suggestion if people want to organise these hate demonstration let they have the bill for the policing assure the hon gentleman that be consider all the recommendation make by adviser to both our administration and the previous conservative administration understand the call for protester to pay one of the difficulty be with implementation rather than disagreement on the substance of that issue it be one of the thing will be look at in the wide review be do it be important that whatever action we take do not create more work for policing which be why have already have discussion with senior police officer across the country about what we should do go forward can assure the hon gentleman that will review those measure very carefully bear in mind all the previous report that have be write will ensure that the framework we be leave with be robust and capable of be police properly and have the confidence of both the police and community it be important that whatever we do we have the resource to meet that if the hon gentleman write to on the specific of what happen with synagogue in his constituency will ensure that he get proper response pass on my sincere condolence to the family and friend of melvin cravitz and adrian daulby some of whom be in the gallery early as my hon friend the member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer say it be important to mention how jews muslims and christians come together unite in their revulsion and mourning in the wake of the attack few day before the attack the punk band bob vylan tell concert in holland the zionists get out there and fight get out there and meet they in the street and other member from greater manchester have urge manchester academy to cancel the bob vylan concert that be due next month because the band be direct threat to the jewish community of manchester do the home secretary agree that the concert should be cancel my hon friend will understand that decision on whether specific concert or other cultural event go ahead be make independently by safety advisory group in those particular location inform by evidence on the operational requirement it would be quite wrong for as the home secretary either to pre empt those decision or to call into question their legal basis by comment on they from the dispatch box it be important that safety advisory group wherever they be take into account all the factor around these cultural event and ensure that they take the measure require to keep our community safe that be the job they be suppose to do and it be the job that hope they will do while the prime minister be swanne around egypt shamelessly try to claim credit for the gaza israel peace deal we have the mayor of london state that the chant from the river to the sea be not antisemitic think it be antisemitic do the home secretary agree with or with the mayor of london really do not think the hon member should lower the tone in that way these be very serious matter and we should all be unite in this house in support the peace process in the middle east which have undoubtedly make progress in the last few day because of the action of the american president and other partner in the region one reason be review the wide legislation in this area include the threshold for what constitute hate crime be precisely that we have many contest phrase that base on context currently fall foul of be prosecute want to ensure that we have the most robust legal mechanism so that hate speech and hate crime be always prosecute in our country and that those who propagate they face the full force of the law begin by praise melvin cravitz and adrian daulby who lose their life defend the life of other in my constituency we have five university with jewish student more than any other constituency in the country we also have hillel house which be attack in after social media post by senior politician what will the home secretary do to protect hillel house on campus up and down the country and will she write to all hillel house to reassure they of their safety on campus be of course happy to provide support and to write in the way that my hon friend suggest in do so will be back the work of the secretary of state for education who have direct responsibility for university as some member will have see the university regulator say on friday that the office for students have power to fine university and ultimately cut off public funding if those university fail to uphold their responsibility to keep student safe include our jewish student on campus it be important that there be whole society response the university sector need to step up and will work closely with the secretary of state for education to ensure that be the case clearly how antisemitism be tackle by the police in our community be key so would be interested to hear from the home secretary what specialist train our police force and the crown prosecution service appreciate that this be bit off piste maybe she might put on her justice hat for moment be receive to help they understand the complexity of investigate charge and prosecute those exhibit antisemitic view early on there be belief among member of the jewish community who live near my constituency that far too many case be drop due to be label as have mitigate issue around concern for israel have discuss these matter with senior police officer across the country know that they often take independent legal advice both on the decision that the police have to make and in testing with the crown prosecution service whether prosecution be likely to result in conviction these be contest area of public and political debate which be why want to review for myself the legislation that be in place will report to the house in due course join colleague in express my condolence to the family of those who lose love one in last week attack also put on record think this whole house will agree our support for the community security trust not just for the tireless work it do every week at shul but for its cross community work so many in our country right now want to divide people by find point that pit people against each other that cross community work be critical to keep everybody in our community safe on that thread one common theme that be come out allude to the comment of my hon friend the member for warrington north charlotte nichols be concern about misogyny and about the record of violence against woman that many of those involve in violent offence have know that the home secretary predecessor be pull together counter terrorism strategy that be go to include that theme in look at antisemitism islamophobia and radical islam can she update we on where that review have get to so that we can be confident that we will get all these people off our street and improve our understanding can reassure my hon friend that the nexus between misogyny and other serious offence include offence relate to extremism and terrorism be something we take very seriously if she will forgive have be in the job for only few week have not yet review all of the counter terrorism strategy our strategy will now need to take account of the thing that have happen in manchester but can reassure my hon friend that it will be publish in the usual way and we will of course consider the wide lesson about misogyny and violence against woman and girl that can be draw first congratulate the secretary of state on the forthrightness and clarity of the message she have send from this house today people in northern ireland appreciate the deep hurt experience by those who go to worship and find that they be victim of terrorism we have have people machine gun while pray people shoot dead as they come out of church and people church bomb over year of ira violence and we understand that will she join in express disgust at those in northern ireland who in the very same week that this attack occur block road and hold protest celebrate hamas terrorist who have carry out the atrocity two year previously that kind of anti jewish hate drive the action we see in manchester do she agree that we can not allow under the cloud of free speech people to use the language that drive sectarianism which be cause hatred division and the loss of safety in the united kingdom the right hon gentleman be right that this country have have to learn painful lesson on sectarianism in the past and it seem we have to learn they again in slightly different context today that can not be our reality in the future and hope that all of we across this house can unite around that work let also be clear for anybody celebrate and support hamas that it be proscribe terror organisation in this country to support that organisation be to break the law of our land and whenever anybody do so they should face the full force of the law after the vile attack in manchester many of we in this house will have spend time with jewish friend last week celebrate the festival of sukkot it be particularly emotional for to do that with friend and to realise that for the sukkah that temporary shelter where we eat that meal you have to have sight of the sky because the jewish community need to be ready always to leave that sense of insecurity be pervade the jewish community now and the home secretary must most importantly address that jews free school in my constituency the large jewish school in europe have huge police presence outside it in the friday afternoon after that attack but as many have say that reassurance should not be necessary we have to address the fundamental insecurity that the community be face let assure my hon friend that while in the initial aftermath of the attack it be important that we focus on reassurance measure and security measure we be clear that in the medium to long term the only way to make sure that all our jewish community be safe and that jewish life in britain can thrive as it have every right to do be to ensure that we tackle the scourge of antisemitism across our country and deal with those wide question of integration and community cohesion congratulate the home secretary on an excellent statement in which she say early on that the police officer involve be be treat as witness that be absolutely right but do she understand that many member of the security force involve in this kind of work fear that they will be hang out to dry many of they will not have their fear assuage by the write ministerial statement today on the legacy of the trouble on which more anon will she reassure that everything be be do by the greater manchester police to put an arm around those officer who be directly involve in this incident and that they will be give every support necessary can assure the right hon gentleman that those officer be be support that be why want to make it clear to the house that they be be treat as witness it be why have ask the independent office for police conduct to ensure that it conclude that part of its investigation as quickly as possible there be wide issue about firearm officer in our country have the confidence to do their job we will soon publish our police accountability review which be design to ensure that we meet the scale of the challenge in give our officer the confidence they need to put themselves in danger for the rest of we there be sometimes question that have to be answer and think we can all accept that to be the case but we should do that in framework that command public support as well as the support of the professional with thing do in timely way so that we can get answer as quickly as possible and not have debilitate impact on police confidence in the long term commend my right hon friend for her statement and also for her prompt response which know be appreciate by people in manchester on the very day believe that people should be able to pursue all religion or none without intimidation or fear of be attack also believe in freedom of speech and the freedom to protest but do my right hon friend agree that people can not use that right to promote hate and promote violence against those with any other religion or belief do she agree that we need to keep that under review to ensure that we do not allow such people to continue to promote these message of hate my hon friend be right protest be fundamental and precious freedom and should be protect but it must be balance against the need for all our community to be able to live in safety and security that be why be carry out review of the wide legislation particularly in relation to hate crime and associate issue be do that to ensure that we know exactly where the line be and to ensure that that line and the careful balance that must be strike be police properly and prosecution follow when the line be cross recently visit synagogue in my constituency to celebrate sukkot but this year our celebration be drown in sadness as we pay our respect follow the terrorist attack on two very brave man we all condemn those attack because as the home secretary say an attack on our jewish community be an attack against we all and we be indeed strong together however do she agree that act of terrorism should not be use to pit community against each other and that by conflate the right to peaceful protest with the action of craze terrorist we be in danger of do just that what step be she take to ensure that there be great community cohesion which will build bridge and not war have to say that disagree with the hon gentleman be very clear that the protest that take place immediately after this terror attack especially in manchester itself be fundamentally un british hope the hon gentleman would agree that sometimes imagine that it be ourselves who have suffer and extend the hand of friendship love and solidarity to community that be suffer be the kind thing to do the right thing to do and the british thing to do would have like to have see the organiser of those protest in manchester in the immediate aftermath of the attack and across the country show some of that very british solidarity that do not mean that people be not allow to protest they be they have be and be sure they will continue to do so but sometimes little bit of solidarity and kindness can go an awfully long way wish to extend my condolence to the friend and family of adrian daulby and melvin cravitz and to the people of manchester and the wide jewish community across the united kingdom follow the appalling terrorist attack at the synagogue in heaton park many in the jewish community feel that this attack be matter of not if but when accord to the community security trust of the antisemitic incident that occur in the first six month of the year be violent assault that be so severe as to be record as extreme violence which mean that they involve gross bodily harm or threat to life will my right hon friend say little more about what she be do personally to tackle the scourge of antisemitism in our nation let first say as say throughout my statement that antisemitism be at unacceptable level it be rise and have be rise for some time and it demand different and new answer from all of we in government and across society if we be to tackle it effectively that mean in the immediate aftermath of the terror attack in manchester that we provide reassurance to the community for their safety and security but in the long term it mean that we must work across government to tackle antisemitism wherever we find it whether in the national health service on our university campus or in protest and march we must hold the line between action that might be offensive but be lawful and that which be hate crime and must be prosecute under the law section of the public order act already allow senior police officer to place condition on protest march for instance by reroute it if the march will be noisy disruptive or intimidating so can the home secretary clarify her comment about section when she talk about address the cumulative impact of the march be she still talk about allow the roll anti israel march to go ahead just use different route or do she want to give herself the power to stop they altogether the measure that have announce will be about place condition on march under both section and section of the public order act what become very clear to in the immediate aftermath of the terror attack in manchester be that there be inconsistency of practice across police force in the country as to whether cumulative impact could be take into account when they make decision about whether to place condition on march or protest the legislation propose will make it explicit that cumulative impact be in and of itself feature that policing can take into account in order to put condition on march it will not need to meet any other threshold before condition can be place on march or protest on the wide question be review the broad legislative framework will have more to say about potential ban although the hon gentleman will know from his time at the home office that the policing and banning of protest have consequence as do allow they to go ahead with condition again it be one of those area where careful balance need to be strike hope there might be cross party agreement on how we get that careful balance and on how we hold it and ensure that the police be able to police effectively whatever we may decide in the future thank the home secretary for her statement and agree with she that anyone seek to divide we will only unite we join hon member in pay tribute to both melvin and adrian family refer the home secretary to the comment from my hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane about look at the issue in police across the country sadly the home secretary will be aware of the recent exposé on the met police who be responsible for some of the major counter terrorism operation across the country those seek to protect people who report hate crime should not be the perpetrator of hate crime and we see some disgraceful behaviour in that exposé this week be national hate crime awareness week every community should feel confident about report crime to the police but we know that for every hate crime report many more go unreported because people do not feel safe or have confidence in the police will the home secretary look at some of the issue across our police force my hon friend refer to the bbc panorama exposé into the met police and this be the first time have be able to place on the record my view on that matter like everybody else be horrified particularly at the situation at charing cross police station which have be the focus of previous exposés and promise of change have discuss these matter with both the mayor of london and the chief of the met police and be reassure that they be absolutely clear eyed about the need to tackle the issue that be expose in that programme we be all united in our desire to root out from our police force all individual who hold horrible attitude and we can not trust to police our community safely they have no place in our police service and be confident that through the work of the met police go forward and through the mayor of london and other partner work together we will get to place where we can be confident in our police force hope to work closely with member from across the house on that issue as well join the home secretary in pay tribute to cst and greater manchester emergency service for their response on the day and particularly to those brave member of the congregation who protect their fellow member thank the home secretary for her quick response in come to greater manchester as greater manchester mp myself know it mean great deal to our community be proud to have the yeshurun hebrew congregation in my constituency as well as north cheshire jewish primary school meet the rabbi on the monday before this horrendous attack and we talk about the genuine fear in our community about the rise in antisemitism which be horrendous foreshadowing of what would happen at heaton park completely agree with the home secretary that more security should not be the answer but we be in situation in which more security be currently need will she assure the house and the jewish community that great resource will be give to cst the police and local authority to ensure great visible protection around our synagogue and our local jewish school not just in the immediate term but for as long as necessary to reassure the community that they be safe let assure the hon gentleman and the whole house that we be discuss these matter closely with the community security trust and other representative of the jewish community the prime minister and will have more to say in the come day about the medium term picture on security and funding for place of worship in our country let assure the hon gentleman that we take this very seriously know he will agree that in the long term we need not only simply to provide protective security but to know with confidence that all our community can go about their business without have to go through security cordon before they do so eighty nine year ago this month the british union of fascists lead by oswald mosley try to march through the largely jewish east end of london they be march off by people of jewish irish and working class background in what become know as the battle of cable street unite in protest against antisemitism follow this month horrific antisemitic attack and amid surge in the far right target of minority and the attack at peacehaven mosque do the home secretary agree with that we must tirelessly oppose fascism antisemitism islamophobia and racism and also protect the hard worn democratic right to protest which be crucial to defeat fascist in cable street in my area in historic act of solidarity and unity in british history my hon friend be right that act of solidarity among community to protect each other reflect the absolute good of our country as have say there be careful balance to be strike in relation to the fundamental freedom and right to protest sometimes for cause we can all believe in and sometimes for cause that be much more politically contested it be fundamental freedom and one of the thing that make this country such strong and free place to be but there must be balance between that and the right for all of our community to go about their business with safety and security which be why have make the announcement about the public order act think the balance strike at the moment be in the wrong place and we need to take some step to correct that thank the home secretary for the statement and thank she and her team for deal very promptly with an issue have raise over the last couple of week my thought and prayer go out to the jewish community and thank those from the jewish community who have reach out to to speak about their concern visit jewish school with the cst and it be awful to see child young british child in century britain have to do drill on protect themselves from lone wolf attack we be clearly not in the right place on this in the sentiment of deal with the root cause do the home secretary agree with that inter faith work have fall off cliff and that that need to be deal with be also concerned about the raising of palestinian flag in the centre birmingham close to home and preston council hosting of know palestinian terrorist all of these thing contribute to the feeling be get from the jewish community which be that they do not feel safe in this country this attack have shine light on the burden that british jews bear every single day just to live an ordinary jewish life there be nothing bad than imagine little child in our country have to go through drill every day at school to keep themselves safe would hope that everyone across this house could commit ourselves collectively to do everything we can to root out the evil of antisemitism because no child should have to do what have become ordinary and normal for british jewish child in our country that be disgrace for we all it sham we all and we absolutely need to work together to fix it on inter faith work the hon member be right in the last two year people who have do inter faith work for or year have tell many time that it have fall off cliff there be no easy answer for how we get it up and run again think it will take careful delicate work to bring people together again and rebuild some trust between community between our muslim and our jewish community let be frank about that with enough good will and british generosity of spirit it be possible for we to get that work up and run see it as crucial in tackle the scourge of antisemitism and other form of hatred and in make sure that our country be safe place for people of all different community hope the whole house will support that share with member the joy at the hostage be release today and the sorrow at the loss of melvin cravitz and adrian daulby and send my condolence to their family join the home secretary in condemn this attack and condemn antisemitism and racism meet our local rabbi last week to share my solidarity and be so pleased that the congregation have receive so many message of support from across the community and other faith group the mosque church and other group and that there be real support from the local police for which they be very grateful do the home secretary agree that it be vital that we continue to send united message that we support the jewish community and their right to live and worship in safety and that we all have role here in this place and in workplace school and street across this country in take action against this it be natural after terror attack that we might focus on the action of those who still wish to cause pain and do damage to our community but my hon friend be right since the attack million of brits have come together in the spirit of solidarity towards one another whether in our church synagogue mosque and other place of worship or in place that be community institution open to all faith and none it be those act of solidarity that will ensure we can be strong country go forward when we allow islamist hate preacher such as sheikh alafasy to do speaking tour it be no wonder british jews in the uk no long feel safe in january he have platform at the bridgewater hall in manchester despite the jewish representative council raise its concern they be ignore in the follow up meeting describe as an appalling tick box exercise the chief executive could not have care less it now turn out that this sheikh be one of only people that the terrorist perpetrator of this attack follow on twitter there be chance that he be at the event in january can the home secretary advise what her department be do to hold the chief executive andrew bolt and the trustee of bridgewater hall to account for completely fail to take the concern of manchester jewish community into consideration it be not just the hate march thank the hon gentleman for his question forgive do not know the specific of that particular case if he write to will discuss it with the security minister and ensure he get an appropriate response first welcome the move to consider cumulative impact when it come to police the issue discuss today it be hugely positive move and hope it can be apply to static protest as well as march in the aftermath of the horrific attack on the synagogue early this month the centre for counter digital hate undertake research that show the shocking but these day sadly not surprising number of call for further violence against jews on the social media platform do the home secretary agree that those advocate online for the death of jews and for synagogue to be burn down be exactly the sort of content that the online safety act be suppose to address do she also agree that it be utterly reprehensible for anyone to give positive publicity to those on social medium call for people to be kill and for building to be burn down on the measure on cumulative impact yes they do apply to both static protest and march that be why they be measure aim at both section and of the public order act as say early in my statement be very clear that the online space be not go to be free space for antisemitism which present itself both on the left and the right and everything in between of the political spectrum will discuss these matter with the secretary of state for science innovation and technology echo comment across the house and extend plaid cymru sympathy to the family of everyone affect we as mps and other commentator in the public sphere need to be vigilant and alert to the potential consequence of inflammatory language as we recall what happen on october thank the antisemitism policy trust for its work show how utterly unacceptable it be that antisemitic trope place jewish people in peril do the home secretary agree that with free speech which we rightly treasure come responsibility yes do that be why describe the protest in the immediate aftermath of the attack as un british we have our right and we can choose when to use they we can choose whether we wish to cause pain to people or not wish that those individual who be involve in the protest in the immediate aftermath have choose to show sense of british generosity of spirit rather than go on those march that day share the home secretary condemnation of this terrorist attack be pleased to join my jewish constituent in solidarity at an event to mark sukkot this weekend it be particularly touch that we be join by people of all faith include hindus and muslims they be there in solidarity but also with anxiety of their own one hindu community representative say to this incident make we nervous that this could happen to we as well do the home secretary agree that the government protection must extend to people of all faith can she say more about what she will do to ensure that people of all faith can meet celebrate and worship without fear agree with my hon friend the government place of worship protective security scheme be open not just to synagogue but to mosque and other place of worship and already make significant sum available for the protection of mosque and other temple we be work closely with representative from the community on what we might need to do go forward associate myself with the tribute pay to those who be kill in manchester and to the invaluable work of the community security trust whose headquarters have visit pay tribute to my constituent who have send wall of love and support in message to our local synagogue show how they absolutely reject antisemitism the manchester attacker be wield knife my local police force have stress to the ease with which someone even with pattern of criminal behaviour can obtain lethal knife we do not know what kind of knife be use or how the attacker obtain it but we do know that the southport attacker purchase inch machete from knife warehouse retailer which in the word of the inquiry chair show no curiosity at all about whom it be sell to it be clear that those who intend to commit violence can arm themselves with alarming ease by exploit online loophole that treat lethal weapon as ordinary product do the secretary of state agree that we now need far strong and clear approach to tackle the online sale and circulation of these knife and to close the gap that allow seller to profit from they the hon lady will know that we be already take action in the crime and policing bill to ban the sale of those knife it be little too early to draw wide lesson about exactly what happen in this case but be sure we will return to these matter in due course once more of the fact be in commend the home secretary for her statement and join she in both condemn this despicable attack and send condolence to the family of melvin cravitz and adrian daulby they be hero may their memory be blessing hendon have one of the large jewish community in the country many of my constituent be scared must tell the house in all candour that more than few be ask whether there be future for they and their family in this country one of the source of concern be the fear of bias towards jewish patient in the nhs can the home secretary expand on the action the government be take to ensure that all may be treat in the nhs without fear and stamp out antisemitism in our health system it be an absolute outrage that any patient in our country might be afraid of seek treatment in our national health service because of the express view of the person who be treat they we be determined to ensure that that be not something that anyone in our country include in our jewish community have to go through that be why the health secretary have already announce that he will be overhaul the regulatory system for medical practitioner and be sure he will come to the house in due course to give more detail the green party stand shoulder to shoulder in cross party solidarity with the victim and survivor of the horrific attack on the heaton park synagogue pay particular tribute to those who put their life at risk to bring the attack to swift stop the home secretary have today speak passionately and personally about the fight against the scourge of antisemitism be the same as the fight against any form of prejudice and very much welcome that be sure she will agree that it be essential to say loudly clearly and unequivocally that prejudice hatred or violence against jewish people be totally unacceptable in our country and will not be tolerate the home secretary have use this opportunity this moment to announce further restriction on protest which confess do concern important point have be raise in the chamber today regard radicalisation within online space will the home secretary ensure that every policy measure she take be focus on build solidarity between community and counter division in our country agree with everything the hon lady say until she get to restriction on protest let be clear there be balance

that report directly to they and they will all come before this house to set out further measure and how we will hold people accountable for their power do the home secretary agree that the murderous attack on the jewish community in manchester be the product of the rampant islamic radicalisation that we have see across our country something which chime with the antisemitism that have be evidence in the bitter hate march in our capital city in that context be enough be do to deal with the radicaliser do we not need to strike the axe at the root of this problem much of that root be those who be radicalise young people to carry out awful act such as this repeat to the hon and learn gentleman my early comment on deal with the domestic threat we face the large of which be islamist extremism we will know more about the specific journey that this attacker take before he carry out his attack when more of the fact be in but assure the hon and learn gentleman that whatever wide lesson be to be

their life as result of the manchester synagogue attack and to those who suffer the trauma of the loss of family member thank the home secretary for her strong and emphatic statement she speak for everyone in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland with her word of strong condemnation be sicken and shock to hear of the attack in manchester on yom kippur and the loss of life that ensue it be an establish fact that antisemitism in the uk be once again on the rise to such an extent that there be security detail at all religious event can well remember after the darkley hall massacre that many probably all church across northern ireland have extra security detail on their door those dark day be behind we in northern ireland but they be not behind our jewish friend

to do everything in our collective power to ensure that our jewish community can live full jewish life here in britain in the century welcome the home secretary statement do she agree that slogan such as glory to our martyr globalise the intifada and zionist off our street be unacceptable and likely to encourage unstable individual to carry out horrific action and attack on the jewish people such as the one we see so recently let reassure my hon friend that be carry out review of the wide legislation on protest and threshold for hate crime legislation to ensure that our whole legal framework be as robust as it need to be so that we can strike the careful balance between our freedom of protest and freedom of speech and keep all our community safe speaker statement before we come to the ministerial statement on the china case wish to make brief statement member will know that have already put on record my disappointment that the charge against two individual relate to espionage for the chinese authority have be drop be not only disappointed but very angry it be of the utmost importance to that all those who work in this parliament be able to undertake their activity securely and without interference continue to seek advice from official on what further step might be take to pursue the issue in other way will be issue update security guidance to member later today think there be something the government ought to be aware of it be this parliament and mp here who have be spy on and it be mp office that have be infiltrate as it stand we have see payment for spy on what believe we should be protect at this moment feel we have not have the protection certainly do not blame the minister know that he will be answer lot in his statement and take many question but want to put it on record that be angry and disappointed my job be to protect parliament feel that we be not get that protection security update official secrets act case with your permission mr speaker want to update the house on the fact surround the collapse of the trial of christopher berry and christopher cash however follow the home secretary statement also want to take the opportunity to express my deep sympathy for the victim and family of those affect by the abhorrent terror attack that occur at heaton park hebrew congregation synagogue in manchester on yom kippur tragically two member of the uk jewish community lose their life they remain in the thought of the whole house at this very difficult time also express my gratitude for the rapid reaction of emergency responder the security service and member of that local community two day later mosque in peacehaven east sussex be target in an arson attack fortunately no one be injure my thought and be sure the thought of the whole house will be with member of that local community as well we remain united in stand against hate in all its form as tell the house in september the government remain extremely disappointed by the outcome of the christopher cash and christopher berry case understand the strength of feeling across the house and share the deep frustration at the fact that these individual will not face trial while the decision not to proceed be an independent one make by the crown prosecution service the government remain gravely concerned about the security of our democratic institution and be crystal clear that our parliament must and will be protect from espionage that be why be today announce that national protective security authority will be take further step to protect our democratic institution from foreign interference will set out more detail on that in moment since address the house on september there have be correspondence between hon member the government and the crown prosecution service there have also be widespread and at time wholly inaccurate report in the medium will address the detail set out by the crown prosecution service and the basis on which the government provide evidence to support the case but first let underline fundamental point that have too often be overlook in recent day include by the conservative party the cps bring these charge under the previous government and under the legislation that be in place at the time the official secrets act an antiquated law that be clearly no long fit for purpose in address the complex and sophisticated nature of the state threat that we face today it have be clear for many year that the legislation have not keep pace with the modern state threat that we face today it be evident that the official secrets act be no long fit for purpose as early as when conservative ministers task the law commission with review this antiquated year ago in the law commission and the intelligence and security committee of this house be both clear that the legislation draft before the first world war need to be update as matter of urgency it refer to espionage as any sketch plan model article or note or other document or information which might be useful to an enemy those term be archaic in the modern threat landscape that we now face that be why the labour party support the passing of the national security act on cross party basis close the loophole that have be expose by this case the director of public prosecutions have write to the chair of the home affairs committee the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley and the chair of the justice committee my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter about this case and it be welcome that these fact have be set out the dpp have make it clear that charge be bring in april base on the law as it stand at the time of the offence the deputy national security adviser senior official with very extensive experience in matter relate to national security provide witness statement in december under the previous government far witness statement be request and provide in february and july of this year all the evidence provide by the deputy national security adviser be base on the law at the time of the offence and the policy position of the conservative government at the time of the offence every effort be make to provide evidence to support this case within those constraint the decision on whether to proceed with the prosecution be ultimately take by the crown prosecution service which be hamstring by antiquated legislation that have not be update by the previous conservative order say to both front bench team please this be very important and serious matter we could do without the side chatter despite the evolve nature of the state threat that we face the dpp have give his assurance that the cps be not influence by any external party any member of this government or any senior civil servant or special adviser work within it want to be clear again today as the government have be before that suggestion that the government conceal evidence withdraw witness or restrict the ability of witness to draw on particular bit of evidence be all untrue the dnsa do not materially change his evidence and be under no pressure from anyone to do so what have change be the cps assessment of the case law the dpp have explain that in separate case the crown roussev the high court rule on the threshold for evidence need to prosecute under the antiquated legislation in the light of this new judgment the cps independently decide to seek further evidence but the fact remain that it be not the policy of the conservative government to classify china as threat to national security as the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly say as foreign secretary sum up china in one word as threat be impossible impractical and most importantly unwise have listen with interest in recent day to advice from former conservative ministers on how the uk should now define our approach to china but must remind they and the house that what matter be what their policy be in government the previous government set out their position on china in the integrated review in which they describe china as systemic challenge to uk security in the integrated review refresh of they describe china as an epoch define challenge as the prime minister have explain the current government policy position be immaterial to the assessment make by the cps minister can not retrospectively change policy that exist under the conservative government and as state before the cps decision to drop the case be not influence by any member of this government special adviser or senior official at this moment of profound global change and insecurity these matter have lead to discussion about this government approach to china so let set that out for the house we must tackle the threat that china pose which range from cyber security attack foreign interference and espionage target our democratic institution to the transnational repression of hongkongers in the uk this government be unequivocal that the first duty of government be to keep people safe we fully recognise that china pose series of threat to uk national security yet we must also be alive to the fact that china present we with opportunity it be the world second large economy and together with hong kong the uk third large trading partner the only way to act in the uk good interest be to take long term and strategic approach that mean work in close co ordination with five eye and wide ally to build collective resilience to the threat that china pose invest in our intelligence service and be unequivocal about our position on human right it also mean develop consistent and pragmatic approach to economic engagement without compromise on our national security let set out the recent action that the government have take to strengthen uk security against state threat include those pose by china national protective security authority have today launch new guidance to protect the uk democratic institution from foreign interference the guidance will help member in this house and the other place member of the devolved legislature local councillor mayor and elect representative staff to well understand the nature of the threat it also provide simple effective step for at risk individual to take to protect themselves their team and the integrity of our democratic process the guidance will kick start wide cross

to national security and to keep our country safe we will take all necessary action to deter those who seek to do we harm and to ensure that the uk be well place to tackle state threat include those emanating from china commend the statement to the house may associate myself with the minister remark about heaton park synagogue thank mr speaker for all his work on members security no one have work hard to protect the integrity of our parliament the security minister be very well regarded so be sorry to see that he have be send here again to make these argument which will not wash this be about the ineptitude of the government and can not accept much of what he say he have bring some update to the house which we acknowledge but in essence china spy on this parliament and the government be issue we with leaflet that be not good enough there be member here who have be spy on and sanction by china even madam deputy speaker have be sanction all mp speak today should be act in the national interest nothing else let we remind ourselves of what have happen two man have be accuse of spy on mps in this very building the cps have what it feel be clear and compelling case to prosecute but the trial have collapse because for month and month the government have refuse to give the cps vital information that be not mistake it be not misunderstanding it look like deliberate decision to collapse the case and curry favour with the regime in china instead of admit that the security minister have come here blame the official secrets act when we know that the act be enough to prosecute the case its deficiency have nothing to do with the government failure may remind the house how serious this be if the government do not prosecute those who spy on we it send message to the public that the government do not care about their safety it send message to our ally who share intelligence with we that britain can not be trust and it send message to those who spy on we that they can get away with it let we look at the fact first the government blame the cps the minister come to the house on september and claim that he have become aware of the situation only that day and that the cps decision have be an entirely independent one an assertion that he have repeat today he say be not able to talk about why the cps have decide to make this decision official report september vol he say that it be not for he to speculate on the reason he tell my hon friend the member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns to seek meeting if she want to find out the reason however we now know despite all he have just say that the trial collapse because the government refuse to give the cps what it need and the minister know full well why it have collapse the director of public prosecutions have say that he spend month try to get the government to provide the evidence that the cps need secondly the government try blame the previous government just like the prime minister the minister claim that the cps could not prosecute because the previous government do not describe china as threat can not believe that he would actually say that he know what we say but let remind he for starter the integrated review describe china as listen carefully the big state base threat to the uk economic security the integrate review refresh say several time that china pose listen carefully threat in the then minister for security say from the dispatch box that china pose serious threat but even if the previous government have not say china be threat which they do this government need only to convince jury that it be threat and the minister know that be astonish that he have repeat that nonsense today the minister and prime minister argument have be refute by no less than former dpp two former cabinet secretaries one former national security adviser two former head of and professor of public law at the university of cambridge who say today that minister statement so far be mislead about the legal position they be all clear that those people could have be prosecute under the old legislation be the government position that they be all wrong and the government be right the minister refer to roussev that case last year make it easy to prosecute not hard as the former director of public prosecutions say of recruit people to spy on mps that of itself clearly constitute threat to national security only this government could mess that up we know that the national security adviser jonathan powell have very close relationship with china be we suppose to believe that he be not involve in the substance of the case and discussion around it as they say what do that even mean he be in those meeting act in the name of the prime minister do the government really expect we to believe that he never mention any of this to the prime minister at any point we know from the cps that it spend month and month ask the government for the evidence that it need the government say that the nsa do not take the decision not to give it the evidence so who do who make that decision can the minister answer that question today be the government argument seriously that no minister know anything about this until the trial collapse if that be the case it be astonishing my suspicion be that that be not the case and that ministers do know they have the chinese super embassy in their in tray and they be allegedly be ask to pay billion in compensation for the nationalisation of british steel suspect that they have decide that close economic tie with china be more important than due process and our national security if that be the case and that be the government decision they should tell we and have the backbone to admit it they should explain it to the public the cps and our international ally and let they all be the judge this issue be not go away there be nowhere to hide write to the prime minister today and would like to know when will get response to my question we have also write to the crown prosecution service to ask whether the trial can be reopen if the government finally provide the evidence that they have be hold back we know that the evidence that the cps need exist if the government decide not to provide it then we will know that that be because this weak prime minister do not have the backbone to stand up to beijing find it genuinely astonish that at no point do the leader of the opposition acknowledge that all the act that we have be talk about this afternoon happen when she be in government on her watch believe that it be important to discuss these matter in fair and reasonable way so particularly make sure that the right hon lady have early sight of the statement to give she ample opportunity she have clearly not read the statement she either do not read the statement or do not listen to what have say because she have ask order this statement be very important both to and my constituent please let we hear the minister take every opportunity to give the right hon lady as long as possibly could so that she could look at the point that we be seek to raise today but she have ask question that answer in my early response say that to she because it be important that we seek to discuss these thing in reasonable way matter the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston neil guffaw from sedentary position but think it be important that we should seek to discuss matter relate to national security in reasonable and consensual way that be the approach of this government be genuinely really sorry that the right hon lady have take the opportunity to make whole series of baseless smear this afternoon perhaps we should not be too surprised the statement that we have hear from the leader of the opposition be sadly typical of what we have hear from some of her colleague in recent day for day the conservative party have be make baseless claim that the government deliberately collapse an independent legal process through political interference there be not shred of evidence to back up any of the accusation that she have make do not think that be responsible way to discuss matter of national security remind the leader of the opposition that whatever member might say this afternoon we be here today because of legislation and policy that exist under the previous government the leader of the opposition reference the letter that she have write to the prime minister we want to respond to she in timely fashion so will now respond to the point that she make to the prime minister in case she have forget it be she herself who say in september last year have shy away from call china threat she articulate the previous government policy as business secretary say in september we certainly should not be describe china as foe those be the right hon lady own word opposition front benchers have raise number of question include in the letter publish by the right hon lady early today be very happy to set out the government response to her question first on the question of what ministers know about the government interaction with the cps ministers be aware that evidence be be provide by the deputy national security adviser to the cps as it build case for prosecution as be first agree under the previous government minister and special adviser do not take decision about that evidence and they be not cite in the content the deputy national security adviser be give full freedom to provide evidence without interference as be the case before the general election secondly the right hon lady ask in her letter whether the prime minister be brief by ministers or the national security adviser about the case the prime minister have already confirm that he be brief on the case by official not least because the case begin under the previous conservative government thirdly there have be various report allege that in meeting in september the national security adviser rule that china could not be define as threat and take decision relate to witness or evidence that be simply untrue of course the nsa take part in discussion about national security and diplomatic relation that be literally his job but any discussion be on the basis that the case would be go ahead and about how to handle the implication the national security adviser be not involve in any decision about the substance of the evidence that mean to answer the fourth question raise by the leader of the opposition that he make no decision about the content of any hon member have ask for thorough explanation and be give it to they they might pay the house the courtesy of listen to the response the national security adviser make no decision about the content of any evidence relate to the case itself this be matter for the deputy national security adviser hugely experienced highly capable senior official who provide evidence under the previous administration on question about when and other ministers be aware that the case would not be proceed should say that ministers be inform after the dpp have make his decision and shortly before report restriction be lift hon member will note that come to the house straight away to make statement finally on whether it might still have be possible to argue successfully in court that china be threat regardless of the previous government position not to do so that be judgment for the crown prosecution service however the deputy national security adviser provide evidence reflect the threat pose by china as the cps build its case on the comment reference by the right hon lady make by two former cabinet secretaries note that they have both remark that the official secrets act be not fit for purpose of course if the conservatives have be swift in replace it we would not be here today safeguard our national security be the most fundamental responsibility of this government in year of rule the conservative party be slow both to update our national security law and to adapt to the national security reality that we face today if we follow the conservatives approach to ignore and refuse to engage with china that would undermine our national security on this side of the house we will always defend our national interest call the chair of the foreign affairs committee may begin by express solidarity with the two previous conservative chairs of the foreign affairs committee who would seem to have suffer from have chinese spy in their office that must have be very distressing upsetting and threatening the dpp claim of need further evidence from the government and decision not to publish the china audit have think become conflate and result in great deal of muddle and confusion and allegation that the government be soft pedal on china before we disappear down that rabbit hole may take we back to basic as understand it these man be charge with an offence under section of the official secrets act to pass on information that might be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy when the crown prosecution service be build its case presumably it have witness and presumably that witness be the deputy national security adviser who be there to answer this question be china an enemy without that evidence there be no point in charge the man in what have change since we be tell that what have change be that the enemy be order this house will listen to the right hon member with respect it seem that there be now case law say that an enemy be threat to national security frankly that seem to be low test not high test but if in there be evidence that china be an enemy and the crown prosecution service have make decision to prosecute on that basis can not understand why there have be change now the only other answer be that the crown prosecution service do not properly assess the evidence before make those charge move away from all the light heat and fury it seem to that those be the central point be grateful to my right hon friend she talk about muddle and confusion she be right that there have be lot of ill inform commentary in previous day that be precisely why the government have proactively bring statement to the house to set out the fact of the trial and be very happy to be able to do that let do that again for my right hon friend the dpp have set out the reason at the heart of his decision not to take this case to trial he believe that the evidential test be not meet the dpp take an independent decision on the evidence as be set out in his letter of october the dnsa do not materially change his evidence and be under no pressure from anyone to do so as the prime minister her constituency neighbour have explain very clearly the current government policy position be immaterial to this assessment it be only the government policy at the time that the alleged offence be commit that be relevant my right hon friend will understand that the cps decision to drop the case be not influence by any member of this government special adviser or senior official have be crystal clear about that today the director of public prosecutions have give his assurance that the cps be not influence by any external party as the government have already state the suggestion that the government conceal evidence or withdraw or leant on witness be all untrue call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of his statement over the weekend sir john sawers become the late former intelligence chief to express disbelief at the collapse of this espionage case and our intelligence ally be now also question whether the uk can be trust to counter china grow threat it be vital that we have clear answer about who in government be responsible for the failure to bring this case to trial sadly instead of clear answer over the weekend we have hear minister deliver vague and cryptic line to take the nation have right to understand which figure within government be involve in the process not to proceed with prosecution give the minister statement that the government have not conceal the evidence or suppress anything will the minister commit to publish timeline showing who know what and when and who say what and when will he publish correspondence between all official politician and adviser involve with the cps if he will do that we can gain the clarity that we and the british public need will the minister confirm again with full confidence that the prime minister or any individual who act on his behalf play no role in any decision to prevent the supply of relevant evidence to the cps which might or might not include word of gentle encouragement either way we must learn the lesson from this appalling episode so that we can have confidence in the ability of our national security law to protect our interest and protect our democracy that be our job in this house this be the only way to provide the british public with the answer that they deserve and demand and to rebuild the uk credibility with five eye ally will the government commit today to hold statutory independent inquiry into the china spying case we know that china pose clear threat to this country interest and value view that be share by liberal democrat members as well as by our intelligence chief yet the government approach to this case be only the late example of their unwillingness to challenge beijing effort to expand its espionage capability in the uk and export transnational repression to our shore it be time for the government to take the step necessary to protect our interest and those of our citizen work with the cps will the government look at all legislative option to prosecute the two individual involve those option be still available will the government block the application for the chinese mega embassy and will the minister add china to the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme welcome the hon gentleman to his new role as he may know be regular visitor to his constituency and pay tribute to the important national security work that take place there he ask number of question and with great respect to he hope that he will concede that have respond to number of they already on his point about release information which be an entirely reasonable question it be not for to make decision about the publication of evidence that may be use in any further ongoing legal process so hope he understand the reason that be unable to commit to do that at the moment take issue with the hon gentleman analysis of the government relationship with china particularly on transnational repression hope that he will accept that the government take that very seriously we have do lot of work through the defend democracy taskforce to ensure that we have the right resource in the right place to protect all those who live here in the uk from the impact of transnational repression but be happy to discuss that with he far the hon gentleman specifically raise the importance of our five eyes alliance about which agree with he that be precisely why the uk recently host the ministerial gathering of the five country in london where we cement our excellent relationship with our five eyes partner as he will know we share intelligence with they on very regular basis that relationship be in good health and have in no way be undermine by recent event call the chair of the justice committee the government have make it clear that they regret the fact that this case be not go ahead the minister rightly say that the cps act independently when make charge decision but will he go far than regret and say that as matter of law and evidence this prosecution should have go ahead and that the issue of innocence or guilt should have be determine by judge and jury have huge amount of time for my hon friend the expression that use both on september and again today on behalf of the government be that we be extremely disappointed hope that he will understand not least give the select committee that he chair that it be not appropriate for ministers to give advice to the director of public prosecutions or the cps on matter of law the cps and the dpp be rightly independent of government frankly we go down quite dangerous road if we get into situation of politician and minister seek to advise they and to influence their decision that be not the approach that this government will take call the chair of the home affairs committee there be real threat at the moment to public trust in the criminal justice system follow the collapse of this trial will the minister make commitment that he ministerial colleague and other adviser will co operate fully with any scrutiny work do by my committee or other committees of the house can give the right hon lady that absolute assurance the government and both the departments in which serve take the importance of parliamentary scrutiny very seriously as chair of the home affairs committee the right hon lady conduct herself with great gravita and of course give she an assurance on behalf of government that we will work closely with she and her colleague to provide any information that they seek follow on from the point make by the chair of the home affairs committee it be vital that parliament be able to examine what have happen here the government have make commitment to transparency we have wrinkle in that the national security adviser have be appoint as special adviser rather than as an official which mean that he have to appear in front of committee of the house in camera that be far from adequate will the minister commit to engage fully with the committee corridor to ensure that the relevant committees get access to information as be normal in reading room in camera or in cobra situation in order to ensure that parliament can satisfy itself of the comment that he have make so clearly at the dispatch box today be genuinely grateful to my hon friend for her suggestion hope that she the house and opposition front benchers know that my approach will always be to make as much information as possible available to colleague whether through the privy council process or through other mean welcome the fact that the national security adviser will shortly be give evidence to the joint committee on the national security strategy but be happy to look more closely at my hon friend suggestion and to give she an assurance that we will want to work very carefully with this house and its committees to make sure they be able to do their important job of hold this government to account as my right hon friend the leader of the opposition say the and integrated review be very clear all the official and security service say that china be significant threat that be sufficient not only for ministers but for official to give to the cps the question be why they do not the question really want to ask be about the absurdity of the role or lack of role of the national security adviser the government say that he be not involve in any matter of substance but be it not the role of the national security adviser to be involve in all matter of substance when it come to national security what be the point of national security adviser who do not involve themselves in matter of national security as in this case instead be we mean to believe that the deputy national security adviser be allow to involve themselves in substantial matter of national security in this case but apparently not to discuss these substantial matter of national security with the national security adviser this seem to to be matter of substantial absurdity the right hon gentleman have be consistent in express those concern over many year would gently point out to he that the situation he describe as absurd be the same situation that we inherit from the previous government the right hon gentleman be very experienced member of this house so let say something to he about the national security adviser over the past year this government have rebuild our international relationship lead on the global stage and sign new agreement with multiple country to safeguard our security and to grow our economy the national security adviser be do an excellent job and if the right hon gentleman do not believe perhaps he should speak to steve witkoff share mr speaker fury about the collapse of this trial as be sure all member do it be huge disappointment that this former conservative party researcher have escape justice be pleased that my hon friend the minister have be able to be so unequivocal about the fact of this case it be extraordinary that have listen to he the leader of the opposition should carry on almost as though his statement have not happen because he have answer many of the question that she pose on the change that have happen since can my hon friend be sure that we would be more able to pursue criminal conviction if this offence have take place under the current legislation if not can he tell we what he be do to make sure it do not happen again be grateful to my hon friend who ask such very useful question that parliamentarian should be ask themselves yes can give he that assurance and have make clear from this dispatch box on many occasion the importance that this government attach as be sure the previous government do to the national security act it be groundbreaking piece of legislation and as my predecessor the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat would acknowledge have pay tribute on numerous occasion to those who be involve my hon friend ask the right question the nsa close the loophole that we be essentially debate today so can assure he that our legislative framework be in much well place than it be couple of year ago that say because this government take these matter incredibly seriously we constantly look at the legislative framework to assure ourselves that it be appropriate we work very closely with jonathan hall kc who have make recommendation at the government request on our legislative framework and we have make commitment that wherever there be requirement for more legislation we will bring it forward the integrated review refresh which state that the chinese communist party pose threat to our people and our security be in fact publish the very day that these two man be arrest but that in itself be red herring because the bulgaria case prove that it be for jury to decide whether country be or could be threat and it be not for the government alone to prove that the minister tell the house in response to our urgent question that the government demand that the chinese chargé come in for the démarche do minister do that or do an official do it secondly give that the house have be tell how disappoint the government be with this outcome and that they seem to be quite clear about the evidence of guilt what repercussion be they choose to put on the chinese communist party will they be cancel the joint economic and trade commission will they be put in place sanction will they be ban the embassy if they will not act why not of course the hon lady have very close personal interest in this case and it will be well understand by member across the house why she have express concern today and previously be sorry that she do not feel that the government response be adequate but assure she that will endeavour to ensure that this government do as much as we possibly can to work with she and the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith on this issue so that she can have confidence that these matter be not able to happen again the hon lady specifically ask about the démarche reference in my statement it be not an urgent question on september as she will know that be do through the foreign commonwealth and development office but will come back to she with more detail should she wish thank the minister for his statement and for introduce some fact to the debate can see that some alternative reality have come crash down want to focus on the future and the minister commitment to protect democratic life in the uk particularly through the cyber security measure he know that this will rely at least in part on the computer misuse act if my memory serve right the amstrad be then the good computer we could get as he know many people think that that act fail to distinguish between malicious actor state or otherwise and cyber security professional work in the public interest and perhaps the democratic interest will he commit to look at that anomaly be grateful to my hon friend not least for say that fact matter they really do that be why have come to the house today to set out fact so that member can make judgment on how they wish to proceed my hon friend also make an important point about cyber security and the ongoing review of the computer misuse act can assure he that we take these matter incredibly seriously in fact will have more to say about it shortly the minister and have be friend for many year so it give no pleasure to say this the statement that he read out today no doubt under instruction have throw out more chaff and set up more straw man than russian disinformation campaign it be pure fabrication to claim that those be the relevant point and sadly he know it the minister know it because we discuss many of these issue when he be in opposition and be in his place he know it because the various security and defence review that have be update in the past four year have set out the clear position of the threat he know it because stand at the dispatch box as he now do on april and make clear the position of china be threat and the minister know it be afraid because the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry the chair of the foreign affairs committee set out how the dpp have ask very clear question why have we not have the information in time for these case to proceed that be exactly the right question the dpp do not say that the evidential threshold be not meet if it have not be meet the arrest should never have happen and the minister should rightly be haul the head of the head of counter terror policing and the treasury solicitor before he for abuse of power he be not do that because he know the threshold be meet instead the minister should read the word of the dpp the threshold be no long meet that mean there have be change and there have be change because something have change that change could either be commission or an omission and from what we have hear today from the way in which the government have very carefully use language it sound much more likely that something have not be do than that it have as my friend the minister know simply ignore an order be not the same thing as not receive one be afraid that what this have do and what this statement do be advertise that the uk be not willing to defend itself against threat from hostile state know that that be not position he wish to advocate as the house know well the right hon gentleman be personally invest in this issue member will understand the history and the reason for the concern he have express and understand why he have take the opportunity to express they today and on other occasion the government fundamentally agree with some of his concern though clearly not with his subsequent analysis he will have note the point have make today about the issuing of guidance from the npsa we have publish that guidance today and hope he will acknowledge the determination that exist from myself as the minister and from colleague right across government to provide assurance and satisfy his concern one of the way in which we will do that be through the defend democracy taskforce of which the right hon gentleman be found member can say to he and to the house that that taskforce provide the fulcrum point for deal with many of these matter right across government it have have its mandate refresh by the prime minister and we invest lot in that mechanism it will seek to provide we with some of the answer we need in order to give the right hon gentleman the assurance he seek hope he will understand that stand ready to meet he and the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns to far discuss any concern they might have the right hon gentleman may not be satisfied today but will do what can to provide that satisfaction and assurance as we go forward my constituent will welcome the minister clarity that china be indeed threat interruption let finish those threat to our national security take place not just here but overseas and be increasingly trouble by the action of the chinese government in former british colony across the world not least in africa they be loot mineral destroy nature and damage democracy that impact we in this country too and for far too long britain have be miss in action we have let china run riot and enough be enough what engagement have the minister have with the soft power council to ensure it keep national security in mind as it carry out its work and can urge he to work with colleague across government particularly in the foreign office we need to get serious with china and fast which require cross government approach absolutely agree with my hon friend that these matter require cross government approach and that be precisely the way in which this government seek to proceed with they think it be fair to say that the government have reference concern about the issue he have raise on number of occasion but would be very happy to discuss they far with he should he wish to do so the minister use the roussev case in his own defence in that case the court of appeal set the clear precedent that the appropriate definition of an enemy state be not base on what the government say it be state that behave like an enemy the judge state plainly that there be no reason in our view why the term an enemy should not include country which represent current threat to the national security of the uk throughout the duration of this case there have be ample evidence include from the intelligence and security committee and the current director of that china represent threat to our national security include at the time when mr berry and mr cash be act as spy the prime minister comment on this case be frankly nonsense and it be time that we stop kowtow and take stand against china if the minister mean what he say about future dealing will he start by do what number of people have call for and refuse to approve the espionage centre masquerade as an embassy at the royal mint will he reject it and tell the chinese effectively that enough be enough always listen to what the right hon gentleman have to say but that do not mean that always agree with it do not agree with it today and be not sure it be especially helpful to refer to china application for an embassy in the way he have do can give he the assurance that have give the house previously about the importance we attach to national security in the context of that issue hope the right hon gentleman understand that the issue of the embassy be not matter for there be quasi judicial process in place and it be matter for the secretary of state for housing communities and local government but the previous home secretary and the previous foreign secretary have be crystal clear about the national security implication that underpin that decision all of we across this house have an interest in protect and preserve our democracy clearly we have threat to our democracy internally as well as externally the minister say little bit about the election bill but can he set out in more detail what the safeguard and protection will be for our democratic institution and indeed for this place my hon friend ask really important question in july the government publish policy paper outline their proposal for an election and democracy bill which we will introduce as the elections bill as soon as parliamentary time allow our intent be to modernise our democracy so that it be fit for the century include reinforce safeguard against foreign influence in our election in relation to political finance hon member may want to listen very carefully to this tough new rule will require party to assess company from which they be receive donation against series of test prove their connection to the uk and ireland this will end the status quo whereby new company register today own by anyone fund from anywhere and without even single day of trade can donate and have influence in uk politic the introduction of know your donor check will increase scrutiny of donation require recipient to conduct enhanced check to decrease the risk of illegitimate donation enter our system this will guard against foreign interference it will be very interesting to see whether or not opposition members vote for that bill the minister say categorically and very carefully that the national security adviser take no decision as to the content of the evidence provide to the cps will he clarify for the house whether the nsa have any influence at all direct or indirect and whether about provision or omission over the content of that evidence provide by his own deputy which lead to the collapse of the trial can give the right hon gentleman that assurance thank the minister for his absolute clarity today will he provide further detail of the measure he have announce today and how they will protect parliamentarian councillor and those in public life across the uk from foreign interference the proposal contain in the election bill will hopefully go long way towards provide that kind of reassurance but again reference the importance of the work be do by the defend democracy taskforce it be mechanism that we inherit from the previous government which bring together ministers law enforcement and senior official to look very carefully at these issue and make sure that we have the right resource in the right place hope very much that this will be shared endeavour across this house to ensure that wherever there be attempt to interfere with our democracy and harass or intimidate elect representative we can stand together as house against those threat the minister say that it be for another department to decide whether the chinese government should have new embassy that be certainly true but the propose new embassy be so large that it would be the big embassy in any country anywhere in europe that have national security implication and if the minister want to encourage people to believe that the government be not cosye up to communist china he should make recommendation accordingly may just ask the minister about the extract he read from the act will read slightly full one though still one with ellipsis if any person for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interest of the state obtain or communicate to any other person any document or information which might be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy he shall be guilty of felony my reading of that extract from the act be that the felony lie in the disclosure to anyone at all it do not have to be directly to an enemy whether or not china be regard as an enemy at the time the nature of the sensitive material disclose mean it be felony even if it be disclose to china that be not regard as an enemy surely the trial should have go ahead the right hon gentleman know that always value his sage advice and listen carefully to what he have to say interruption it be true he ask about the embassy so that we can dispel some of the nonsense that have be spout about the embassy we need to provide privy council briefing for he and for other privy counsellors and be happy to take that away on his second point he know that these be point of law and matter for the cps and the dpp they be not matter for ministers welcome the minister clarity on tackle the threat that china pose include the transnational repression of hongkongers in the uk that will be real reassurance to the many british national overseas who live in milton keynes would like he to go into further detail particularly in the context of the intelligence and security committee report on russia interference in brexit and the nathan gill case that have just complete with eight count of bribery come from russia at the time of take those bribe he be close colleague of some mps on the other side of the house how will the new election bill stop interference through political funding which we be see gain more and more ground here in the uk create real threat to our democracy ask the minister to be brief and on point regard what this statement be actually about the safety and security of hongkongers in the uk be of the utmost importance and any attempt by any foreign power to intimidate harass or harm individual or community in the uk will not be tolerate on my hon friend second point and not want to get in trouble with madam deputy speaker just say that use position of public office to effectively furth russia malign interest while benefit financially will not stand it be betrayal of our democratic value and of our electorate the minister have tell we that his government assessment of china be mixture of national security threat and opportunity for engagement include economically but do he accept that that be exactly the assessment make by the last government that combination with reference to the act and the offence we be concern with do not require country only to present national security threat simply that it do so perhaps in combination with other thing that be the key point and the minister have be clear about that so can we be clear about what happen with the government evidence be it the case that the government could find no evidence of china present national security threat be it the case that the government internally decide that the evidence it could find would not meet the cps requirement if so who make that determination be it the case that the government do supply evidence to the cps on that specific point and the cps decide it be not significant enough if it be the latter will the minister publish the evidence to the house if he do not think that be appropriate it may not be will he give authority to the deputy national security adviser to share that evidence in full with the intelligence and security committee have lot of time for the right hon and learn gentleman not least because he bring an almost unique perspective from his understanding of the law and of matter relate to intelligence he correctly make the observation that ultimately any government strategy on china have to take consideration of national security issue at the same time any fair minded reasonable government have to understand the economic opportunity that exist as former attorney general he would not recommend that get into the business of second guess judgment and decision take by the dpp on his point about publish the evidence he hopefully will have hear the response give moment ago interruption be respond to the right hon and learn gentleman serious question about publish the evidence hope that he will have hear the response give moment ago the minister state we will take all necessary action to deter those who seek to do we harm and that include threat emanating from china despite ongoing transnational repression of tibetans uyghurs and hongkongers continue cyber security attack on this country and member of this parliament be sanction and spy upon there appear to be no consequence for china instead the uk government give in to its coercive bully behaviour have straightforward question if the minister be serious about deter this behaviour and these threat will he take the necessary action and include china on the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme yes or no any decision about the enhance tier of firs will be bring forward to parliament in the normal way can say to the hon member that any attempt by any foreign power to intimidate harass or harm individual or community here in the uk will not be tolerate we know the very basic fact which be that the director of public prosecutions ask for statement from the government to clarify that at the time of the offence china be threat to national security he say in his letter that such an assurance or evidence or statement from the government be not forthcoming we know that the government withhold that vital element of the case the minister be shake his head but who decide that in the word of the dpp it would not be forthcoming somebody decide that he seem to be say that it be the deputy national security adviser who be somehow accountable for make those decision but question that point to whom be they accountable if not to the national security adviser let seek to clarify the deputy national security adviser who be senior and highly regarded official with extensive experience in matter relate to national security provide witness statement in december that be under the previous government and make that point early further witness statement be request and provide as say early in february and july this year all the evidence provide by the deputy national security adviser be base on the law at the time of the offence and the policy position of the government at the time can give the hon member an assurance that every effort be make to provide evidence to support this case within the constraint that have just outline the decision about whether to proceed with the prosecution be ultimately take by the dpp and the cps which be hamstring by antiquated legislation admire the government attempt to pin this on the previous conservative government it be an endeavour in which would usually join they but on this occasion can not because the argument simply do not stack up the argument seem to hinge on the conservative government classification of china as threat to national security that be not formal classification but one that need to be substantiate the government seem to be argue that it be not because for instance in the integrated review refresh of china be merely describe as an epoch defining challenge however the same paragraph in that report talk about the chinese communist party as present state threat to the uk democracy economy and society report by the intelligence and security committee of the same year talk about how china ambition at global level pose national security threat to the uk we have hear other testimony today from and other my question to the government be be this the sort of evidence that be provide to the cps if not why not whose decision be it not to present that kind of evidence there be be afraid fundamental flaw in the hon gentleman question these activity take place under the previous government and under the legislation that be in place at the time this be not about seek to blame the previous government but it be statement of fact to say that those activity about which there be concern across the house take place in the previous parliament and under the previous legislative framework that be just statement of truth have to say to the right hon gentleman whom respect very much indeed that his answer to the question put by my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright the former attorney general raise more question than he give answer be he seriously suggest that the national security adviser with all his link to the group and to the grandview institution have no involvement whatsoever in the advice that go to the crown prosecution service while he be about it will he clarify that apparent conflation of this country economic tie with china which he appear to give in mitigation for the mess that the government appear to have get themselves into respect the right hon gentleman too and hope that he will understand that any government will seek to balance issue relate to national security as well as issue relate to economic prosperity that think be not an unreasonable way in which to proceed do however want to pick he up on one point the national security adviser do not have any link to the group foreign interference in our democracy be of course deeply concern and transparency from government and indeed all legislator be essential that include transparency in relation to past elect representative such as reform uk former leader in wales who have plead guilty to accept bribe from russia to uphold public accountability will the minister commit to work with the attorney general to publish the name of all individual interview by counter terrorism police in connection with the nathan gill bribery case the people of wales be rightly concerned the right hon lady be right transparency be important if she will forgive will look carefully at the point that she have make and take it away but hope this also mean that she will be seek to support our election bill be go to keep this quite basic because think this be where lot of the public will come from the government should always want to do everything they can and more to keep the british public and our institution safe so do not understand why they will not do everything they possibly can at least to try to bring this to trial at least to try to give jury an opportunity to take matter into its hand and consider this case do not understand why they be willing to accept advice and not actually put this matter to trial when they have the opportunity to do so will the minister please commit to publish all minute from any meeting at which matter discuss with the cps or what the cps have request be ask for will keep it basic as well this government will do everything that we can to keep the public safe and the hon lady will have hear the response that give early with regard to publishing issue the stench emanating from the collapse of this chinese spy case make manure heap seem positively floral the bottom line be that everyone be disappoint everyone think there be enough evidence and everyone seem to agree that china be security threat yet the case have collapse and china have be give essentially carte blanche to carry on spying in the united kingdom have it on good authority that senior figure in washington now fear that five eye have become six eye the one thing that have change since charge be make in april be the national security adviser will the minister give commitment that the national security adviser will appear and answer question in person before any parliamentary committee that wish to have those question answer the hon member talk about stench he have some brass neck give what have go on in his party recently the national security adviser be special adviser and give the reference to the united states would point the hon member in the direction of president trump policy adviser who just this morning praise the contribution make by the nsa the problem that the government have be that the story keep change either each day or within day the right hon gentleman who be obviously state the government position now be give we view that completely contradict the message give by ministers over the weekend he have clearly refer to huge number of meeting at which say this with the great respect he be not present can he agree now that the content of all those meeting and the minute of those meeting will be publish so that everyone in the house can understand what have happen if that have to be do under certain rule so that the public do not have access to the information fair enough but the reality be that until such time as the government come clean the stench of this will continue let assure the hon member that take very seriously the point that he have make clearly there will be legal dimension to all this but be happy to go away look at his point and then come back to he in the intelligence and security committee publish report on china in which it write that china be whole of state threat in their public response to the isc report the government write that they recognise the committee concern about the long term strategic challenge the isc have use the word threat rather than challenge do the minister regret that in the government response do not use the word threat with respect to the hon member be not go to become involved in critique about whether the government should have respond in different way because that be matter for they however he mention the important work of the isc the government consider that the isc have very important role to play in parliament it be obviously independent of government and it will clearly be for the chair the deputy chair and the wide committee to take view on how they wish to proceed as for the specific report to which the hon member refer all that material would have be available to be consider by the cps the right hon gentleman be the minister for security have be here for almost an hour and half and have not hear he answer this question be china spy on parliament or be it even consideration that it be spy on parliament have be crystal if hon member will allow let say that china pose series of threat to the united kingdom and be very clear about what they be refer specifically to number of particular issue could not have be clear about that thank the minister for come forward as he know this topical issue lie heavy in the heart of many people in constituency throughout the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland as we consider whether national security have be at threat owe to the semantic of language and the general public be ask for openness and transparency have be contact on number of occasion by concerned constituent of chinese descent who believe that they be be shadow by the chinese secret service and the decision not to prosecute mean that they be feel even more insecure and even more fearful that must be address will the minister tell we exactly when the decision be make to classify china as non threatening and how will tell that to my constituent who be live in fear right now as result of this so call non threat be grateful to the hon member as always think he be refer to activity that take place under the previous government but let agree with his basic point the public do want to know what have happen that be why the government have put forward statement today to provide that transparency what think the public do not want however be ministers or politician interfere in the legal process and seek to influence persuade or cajole senior figure in the cps include the director of public prosecutions do not think that be the right way to proceed and think that hopefully if opposition members and indeed member throughout the house step back for moment we can reach consensus that it be not right for ministers to second guess legal decision make by the crown prosecution service the minister have comprehensively take on several strawman argument answer question that have not be ask and stick to his carefully construct sentence one example be minister and special adviser do not take decision about that evidence and they be not sight on the content but be any minister the national security adviser any other special adviser or any senior official other than the deputy national security adviser such as the cabinet secretary sight on the decision regard the evidence send to the cps fundamentally the decision be one for the dpp and the cps could not have be clear about the fact that this government have not seek to interfere with the process listen carefully to the minister statement but question remain the minister say that china pose threat will the government now publish in full the china audit so that we can know the scale of those threat the minister say that the government will act against transnational repression of hongkongers here in the uk so will the government now implement target sanction against the official in hong kong and beijing who be responsible for the bounty the minister say that the government will legislate against foreign influence will he ensure that the new election bill tackle not only covert foreign political funding but all foreign political funding by shut down the opportunity for foreign actor to influence our politic through corporate donation the hon member reference the china audit be sure that he will acknowledge that the then foreign secretary come to the house to give statement specifically on the china audit the reason why the china audit have not be publish be that it be at high classification than document that would normally be publish hope that the hon member second point be at least tacit welcome of the government election bill there will be number of measure in there which hope that he and his colleague will be able to support it be important that we seek to work together to transform the political landscape to make it much much hard for those who seek to interfere in our democracy to do so the minister have make great play of the need to work cross party on this issue may gently suggest to he that the time to do that be before the case collapse not afterwards the minister have leant heavily on what official be willing to say about the threat or otherwise that china pose but official do not make government policy and do not state the position of the uk government minister do if the government be struggle to find an official who would say in witness statement that china be threat be there any good reason why they could not have ask the former security minister to do so my right hon friend the member for tonbridge tom tugendhat who be happy to give statement at the dispatch box be sure that many other former government ministers would have happily give evidence that china be threat enable the case to proceed what possible reason be there for not do that the hon member talk about my make great play of the need to work cross party but that be because genuinely believe that on important matter of national security we should proceed in certain way and where possible we seek to work across the political divide to establish consensus think there be slight irony in the point that he go on to make agree with he that minister be accountable and if opposition member want to hold ministers to account that be absolutely matter for they what think be most unfortunate be not say that he be responsible for do this but other have do it be when member seek to blame official or imply criticism of they do not think that be the right way to proceed it seem to that the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry the chair of the foreign affairs committee put her finger on the nub of this matter we know that in april the cps decide that the evidential test be meet the evidential test be that there be reasonable prospect of conviction for the offence of pass useful information to an enemy we know that in september the dpp maintain that the evidential test be not meet so what change who change it how do we move from the evidential test be meet to the evidential test not be meet be the evidence before the dpp withdraw be it find to be unreliable or do the government fail to substantiate the evidence that enable the evidential test to be meet back in april with great respect to the hon and learn gentleman that be what be at great pain to explain in my opening remark do the minister agree that the government have now set perverse incentive for british official in that admit to espionage problem with china be see as rock the boat no do not agree the government have not have great record in the court recently kneecap case be throw out because the paperwork be not correct and now we have the spy case not proceed because evidence be not provide the fact of the matter be that china now control many of our supply chain hold lot of our national debt and be an important part of the economic framework in the united kingdom because of its investment in strategic industry the general public may not understand the intricacy of how case be build up and who be involve in it but can the minister understand that despite his excuse ride statement today many member of the public might be come to the conclusion that national security be be sacrifice because the government be not prepared to deal with our increase economic dependency on china no do not agree there will be those include in this house who will seek to simplify the nature of the relationship to single word more sensible and fair minded colleague and certainly the public will understand that difficult choice have to be make fundamentally this government approach will always be to put our national security first have be crystal clear about that today and previously but that do not mean that we should not look for opportunity to trade with country where there will be some economic advantage to do so that seem to entirely reasonable and completely pragmatic but we will proceed on the basis that our national security absolutely come first last month the security minister come before the house and state that he be not happy with the decision not to prosecute ask he why the government be dither over formally challenge china have exclude it from the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme and he suggest that they be not do so subsequent revelation have suggest that the government have yield to chinese threat to withhold investment and to offer to waive the outstanding debt owe to jingye would the minister like to correct the record and explain why china be not in the enhance tier give that we be discuss spy for china can he clarify what role the national security adviser jonathan powell have play in decide that china should not be classify in the enhance tier alongside russia and iran extremely disappointed be the way that describe our reaction both on september and again today gently say to the hon member that he should not believe everything that he read in the paper he ask about firs hope he hear the response that give some moment ago say that we look very carefully at any question of whether to place particular country on the enhance tier of firs firs be an important part of the national security act there be those include on the hon gentleman side of the house who say that we be not go to roll it out but we roll it out on july say that we be go to roll it out on july and we do we look very carefully at how we can most effectively use that tool and we will continue to look closely at that but any decision about the enhance tier will be bring forward in the normal way the government say that they want to take long term and strategic approach to china but that be exactly what china do whether we be talk about it increase control over supply chain to gain leverage over the west the belt and road programme or the debt trap diplomacy with which it be associate abroad this be nothing less than concession to an authoritarian regime and it play into china hand as it want to continue gain economic and military leverage over the west the head of the cps say that he request evidence from the government to allow the case to proceed but the government do not provide that evidence why not and be it still the government view that it be impossible to argue in court that china be threat on the hon gentleman final question have take every opportunity to try to provide the government response be not entirely clear about his critique of take long term strategic approach and whether he think that be good thing to do or not think it be good thing that government think carefully and strategically about their role in the world and the nature of their relationship with country like china yes we have to be clear eyed and have to always defend our national security but we also have to look for opportunity for economic growth as well on point of order madam deputy speaker be it to do with this statement yes madam deputy speaker like you be one of the parliamentarian sanction by china like many member of this house be leave wonder whether it be not just our office that be spy on but our family our home and our child and in the absence of trial have no way of find out what happen the minister have be ask multiple time whether he will publish the minute of the meeting in which this case be discuss we know from the dpp that over month and month the cps ask again and again for evidence that be not forthcoming however without the minute of those meeting we be not able to find out what be ask for why it be refuse or who make that decision what mean be available to this house to get hold of the minute of those meeting which the government do not want to publish what parliamentary mean do we have to get hold of the minute of meeting in which this issue be discuss and these decision be make so that we can find out the truth thank the hon gentleman for give some notice of that point of order he be absolutely correct that he and be two of the four sit mp who be sanction by china have be advise to say that he should seek advice from the table office as first step to see how these document can be publish the minister have say repeatedly in response to member from across the house that some material may or could be make public at some point be not sure what that material will be or what format it would be in but have no doubt that the hon gentleman will seek advice from the table office to make sure that the information be make available if it can be unless the minister wish to respond to that point of order will let the matter fall digital id have always believe in give people power and control over their life control over the public service they use and how they access childcare benefit and housing support control over their datum and who see it and control over the choice they make to rent or buy home apply for job open bank account and much more besides in the age of the smartphone we can take this control quite literally into our own hand but too often it feel like we be at the mercy of system that do not work for we as well as it should it be one with endless form filling and bureaucracy just for people to prove who they be and one where they may need their passport to apply for job their national insurance number to pay tax and their drive licence to buy pint or glass of wine if they be lucky enough to be ask most frustratingly of all they may have to rummage around in drawer look for an old electricity bill just to open bank account join the library or enrol their child in school it be time to fix this to put power back in people hand to get more out of our public service and to bring the uk into the modern age there be three reason why we want to introduce new free digital id available to all uk citizen and legal resident above the age of first it be about give people great agency over their life in over year as local mp have lose count of the number of people who have come to because they have struggle to get the public service they need or have to battle for support from different part of the welfare state be sure many hon member will know frustratingly similar story people be pass from one person to another and ask to repeat their story and provide basic information time and again they be make to fit into system rather than the system work for they which ultimately leave they feel as though they be number on list not human be with life bring in new digital id be about far more than replace numerous bit of paper just for people to prove who they be it be about change the way the state interact with its citizen through what like to see as new digital key that unlock well more join up and effective public service that actually talk to one another and fit around they in build our new system we will learn from the experience of other country some of which have have digital id for over year many show we just how transformative this can be in denmark graduate apply for job have to log into portal only once and their id automatically link to their school record save they retype their qualification each time in finland parent can go online to register their child for day care without upload payslip or put in their salary and the site automatically calculate the right fee in estonia digital id mean that when someone have baby they do not need to go to local office to register the birth sign up for childcare benefit or apply for nursery place that happen automatically from day one in the hospital so parent be free to focus on what matter most digital id have the potential to empower million of people like that in the uk with quick effective seamless and secure integration between different government system we know that the tell we once service make the process of register death more straightforward but we should not have to wait until the end of someone life to offer they join up personalise support so our new system will help modernise government service to fit around people life rather than force they to fit into the system the second reason for introduce digital id be to offer people great security and actually great control over their own datum other country that have introduce digital id find that digitally check credential be far more secure than physical document they be much less likely to be lose or steal they have reduce error and mistake and they have help crack down on fraudster who can ruin people life privacy and security will be hard wire into the system from the start there will be no pooling of people private information into single central dataset it will be federate data system and user control will be at the heart of our plan with digital id people may end up have more choice over what they show the world not less if they be buy drink at the bar instead of show physical driving licence reveal their full name and address they will be able to prove they be over without even show their exact birthday if they do not want to we will ensure that our digital id operate to international good practice standard for datum security and privacy and we be work closely with the national cyber security centre to ensure it keep pace with the change threat we face the third and final reason for introduce digital id be to deliver great fairness by show exactly who have the right to work in the uk digital id be not silver bullet for tackle illegal immigration but it will be deterrent to would be migrant who be consider come to the uk alongside all the other action we be take make id check both mandatory and digital for all employer will provide we with far more actionable intelligence so we can move swiftly to identify rogue employer who be not follow the rule under this government illegal working arrest have go up in the last year that be progress but our digital id will help we to do more it will be mandatory for right to work check by the end of this parliament help tackle illegal working crack down on rogue employer create level playing field for employer who do the right thing and give people who do have the right to be here the cast iron guarantee that this be their country and that they be welcome in the uk for our new id to be both effective and fair it must be genuinely inclusive that be non negotiable for the government and for personally currently around one in uk adult do not have passport or driver licence to prove their identity and around million people do not have smartphone laptop or tablet or be digitally exclude for another reason we be already make progress with our digital inclusion action plan we will continue to work closely with all the relevant organisation to understand the barrier to inclusion and how they can be overcome so we bring everyone into the system want to hear directly from hon member across the house about these matter and from those in the digital identity sector who have so much experience to learn from we will consider physical alternative to the virtual document and face to face support for those who need it such as the of uk household who do not have home internet access ultimately however we want britain to be country where everybody have the digital skill and access to be part of the modern world include through our new digital id to unlock more effective service and support to conclude we will launch full consultation on our plan by the end of this year include with parliamentarian the devolve administrations and member of the public legislation inform by that process will follow shortly afterwards know hon member will have many question and look forward to take they but let just say this some of people over already have smartphone many of we already use digital credential hold in our phone wallet from ticket to event and online banking to store boarding pass people should expect the same service from the government indeed we should be criticise if we be not modernise our service to make they easy and more convenient for the public year from now when we look back believe that have your id on your phone will feel like second nature put more power directly into people hand and give they more control over how they interact with government and the whole range of service that be something worth strive for commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state nearly three week ago the prime minister unveil plan for mandatory digital identity that will fundamentally shift the balance of power between citizen and state he do not announce it here in this house but at love in of the progressive left sponsor by labour together and haunt by the ghost of tony blair the justification be his own catastrophic failure on migration he know it will not stop the boat when brits be force to have id as illegal migration continue unabated it will simply confirm fear of two tier society fuel the division and conspiracy theory that he so arrogantly claim he be the antidote to what cynical mess can the secretary of state set out how the scheme will identify illegal migrant work in the black economy when their gangmaster be expert at avoid any state interaction she rather slink away from those key point in her wonderfully innocuous statement about make it easy to join library we have in the official press release this glorious piece of doublethink it will not be compulsory to obtain digital id but it will be mandatory for some application when employment itself require government issue identity you can not meaningfully consent unless of course you never want to work here be the fundamental issue in free society the burden of proof have always rest with government to justify its action to earn our trust mandatory digital identity reverse that while today the scheme focus on work check labour say it want to extend this type of mandate into more area of our life which area where do it stop understand that even year old be now be consider what about those without digital access labour have deprioritise gigabit roll out and publish very worthy digital inclusion action plan without any action the prime minister point to estonia and india as model we should seek to replicate despite serious cyber vulnerability the uk own sign on system be breach during red team test this very march when million people petition against the plan the government assure they that they would adhere to the high security standard can the secretary of state confirm to we here today that the system on which her mandatory id will be build already meet those standard and that the national cyber security centre will publicly back she up this crafty scheme be not in labour manifesto even the cabinet think the whole thing be fantasy the secretary of state can not even bring herself to tweet about it why do the prime minister keep hand she his steaming mess to scoop up the migration argument have totally bomb we hear it here today she and the prime minister be now reframe this whole thing as the route to well online service no more rifle around for utility bill not an id we hear today but key they be deliberately conflate two very different thing well and more convenient online service be already come in we already have right to work and rent check convenient dbs disclosure and barring service check and drive licence renewal all design with choice consent and privacy in mind paper option retain nobody force down the digital route and trust as the key and private identity provider enable this be not about luddites versus moderniser this be about the fact that labour can not resist its big fat socialist dream centralise database state mandation big money the exclusion of private sector expertise why create this honeypot for hacker how much will it cost why should we trust labour to be the verifier of someone identity when during the passage of the data use and access act it would not even commit to record someone sex accurately let be clear conservative oppose mandatory digital identity in principle and in practice if we believe it be necessary we would have introduce it in government we choose not to because you can deliver well online service without resort to costly control complex and risky system this be cynical distraction from desperate prime minister he want people to believe that mandatory id will fix his migration mess but it will not channel crossing will continue until he introduce real deterrent but he have not get the gut to take on the lawfare industry that make he we believe that government should empower citizen not the other way round that government should earn citizen trust not the other way round only those entitle to benefit should receive they and those with no right to be here must leave but those imperative be not well deliver by control british people instead of those who do not play by the rule the government who promise to tread lightly on our life have get their boot out will the secretary of state now kill this plan rather than be the sacrificial lamb for another of this prime minister grubby mistake well madam deputy speaker that be definitely the first time have be call big fat socialist laughter the hon lady ask how it will help crack down on illegal immigration make id mandatory and digital will really help we to get much more swiftly and automatically more actionable intelligence about rogue employer and about who be do the check they be require to do and who be not secondly the hon lady talk about those who be digitally exclude as say in my statement take that issue extremely seriously we actually have digital inclusion action plan the conservatives do not do one for year if they care so much about it perhaps they would have do understandably and rightly be sure we will have lot of question about have the high possible standard we will be work to international good practice standard there be not many advantage to lag behind so many other country many other country that have digital id but one be that we can learn from their experience when thing have go wrong and how they improve their security that be what we intend to do finish by say this the hon lady come to the dispatch box with fire and brimstone but it be quite interesting that she differ from the shadow home secretary back in february the right hon member for croydon south chris philp back the idea say there be very significant benefit in august he say the conservatives should consider it the conservatives leader in june say that she have move her position on digital id and that if it could answer difficult problem then yes that be something they would look at give the amount of flip flop on the other side of the chamber you would think it be still summer they be not serious and they be not credible until they be they be not electable call the select committee chair the secretary of state be absolutely right to champion access to consistent trust digital id all of we online have digital id aplenty already facebook tiktok his majesty revenue and customs tesco so she be right to bring the benefit of one digital id to my constituent but make digital id mandatory for everyone seek work be poke stick in the eye of all those with security privacy government capacity concern which my committee will be examine as part of our work on digital government for now though can she first confirm that people will be in control of their digital id datum and who access it secondly will she say whether it will be procure externally from the private sector or develop in house by government digital service my hon friend be right to raise the important issue of security people be rightly concerned about the security of their datum and that be why that will be at the heart of our consultation in answer to her specific question yes people will control who see and access their datum and we absolutely expect this system to be design and build within government build on the one login call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank secretary of state for advance sight of this statement but be quite frankly disappointed that this be how we be start the conversation on digital id in parliament we liberal democrats believe that freedom belong to citizen by right but the government plan for digital id for every single work person risk erode the hard win freedom to control the way we live our life they risk exclude million of vulnerable people from their own society and waste billion in public money chase expensive solution that will not work yet again it be gimmick to tackle irregular migration something have hop be reserve for the conservatives yet again by erode public trust with these rush retrofit policy the government have squander an opportunity to use technology to improve public service by bring people with they in addition the government announce this scheme that will impact every single work person in the uk week before it could be scrutinise by parliament any claim from this government that this scheme will be non compulsory and give agency be poppycock in reality as requirement for the right to work it be mandatory id in all but name the secretary of state say so herself just now where be the choice in that last week the foreign secretary propose issue digital id for teenager this be clear government mission creep and it be dangerous liberal have always stand up against concentration of power and for good reason we have see the government abject failure to secure people datum before just ask the victim of the legal aid agency datum breach or the armed force personnel who be victim of the ministry of defence datum breach whether they have faith in the government to keep their most personal datum secure how can the public have trust in the government to manage system that will manage the datum of almost the entire population will the secretary of state commit to publish an impact assessment for the million people without foundational digital skill such as my constituent julie who do not own smartphone and be fearful of be exclude from employment healthcare and other essential service will the secretary of state come forward with plan to reduce the risk of further marginalisation all these serious concern from privacy to exclusion come at staggering cost this scheme will cost the taxpayer billion money that will be waste on system do little to tackle the government state aim of immigration enforcement meanwhile our public service be crumble finally ask the minister how much taxpayer money the government be prepared to waste on this scheme for which they have no mandate and no public support before they admit it do not work will try to keep this brief madam deputy speaker the hon lady raise number of different issue that mention in my statement on digital exclusion we have digital inclusion action plan and will be spend million in local area to help people who be currently exclude to get online we will be publish full consultation on that and be sure she will feed in her view it be interesting that the liberal democrat leader the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey say last month that if uk system be about give individual the power to access public service he could be in favour of it hope the liberal democrats drop their partisan approach and work with we to deliver the system say to the hon lady and to other hon member that many many other country have digital id system the eu be roll out digital id system in all member state ah laughter know that those on the conservative benches do not like it think we need to keep little perspective rise order we have two select committee statement and substantial debate later this evening so this statement will have to conclude in minute ask colleague to keep their question short and the secretary of state to keep her response even short and on point just over month ago visit tallinn in estonia to understand why digital id be so popular with the old the young and those who be define as digitally exclude they tell that it be because they have control over their datum that be hold by the state they can see it see who have access it and who else can see it what be critical in state that border russia be that they have confidence in their absolute control over their data security believe there be lesson that we can learn in the uk my constituent want to know who be in this country who be legally entitle to use our public service and who be entitle to work here do the secretary of state agree that we need to learn from country such as estonia and denmark on those matter yes do my hon friend be right that the citizen of this country rightly want to know who have right to be here and who have right to work here that be very important principle be wholly opposed to this policy as know be many of my constituent while the government have talk about the so call economic benefit of access service and digitalise how we interact with government my constituent be concerned about infringement on liberty and the shift relationship between the individual and the state the state must always be accountable to the individual can the secretary of state rule out this system ever become one through which the government can track location consumer spending habit or social medium activity yes appreciate the secretary of state set out the government ambition have to pick she up on something though because she say this policy would be free but ultimately the taxpayer will have to pay for it the costing that we have see be about billion to billion to create the system and another million each year to run it we know the cost of data breach the office for budget responsibility have suggest it could be of gdp in fact our entire growth be it to happen to the economy marks spencer jaguar land rover and co op have all show we that can the secretary of state therefore give we at least ballpark figure for the capital and revenue cost that she envision for what she have set out thank my hon friend for her question we also need to look at the potential benefit of this policy in saving from crack down on fraud and make service more effective and efficient clearly the eventual cost will depend on the design and build of the system which be what we be consult on be sure that she and many other colleague will feed in their view give that digital id will not stop illegal immigration and will far erode our civil liberty will the secretary of state confirm that the prime minister announce it only as deterrent to those seek to topple he at the labour party conference if not what be the actual purpose of this policy that be nonsense have be contact by large number of constituent in recent week whose healthy scepticism about digital id make material difference in tackle illegal immigration share think there be scope for well digital integration across the public sector more generally but the secretary of state talk in her statement about lot of hypothetical thing thing that this policy could do in the future and the only use case that have be confirm so far be right to work check can we be clear on the use case that we intend to pursue and over which timescale so that we have the information we need to make decision on whether we want to go down this path these be not hypothetical we be look at how other country have use these system to deliver more effective government and other service to their citizen we have propose have mandatory right to work check by the end of the parliament but there will be many important voluntary way in which people can well access service and support we will be consult on that fully when we come forward with the detailed proposal be firmly against the government plan to introduce digital id which be alarm state overreach this pledge seemingly make on whim give that it make no appearance in the labour manifesto and there be no mandate for it seem to be desperate attempt to shore up labour moribund pledge to smash the gang there appear to be little appetite or enthusiasm for this proposal on the government benches and the claim that it will curb illegal immigration when we be still offer asylum seeker somewhere to live and an asylum support enablement card of week be not support by the evidence have receive huge amount of correspondence on this matter ask the secretary of state what guarantee she can give my constituent that the scheme can be afford that their datum will be safe and that the scheme will be never use to track their use of service have already say that the scheme will not be use for that in many other country these system have make access government and public service much easy quick and more efficient think there be some scaremongere about this issue such scheme in other country really have make government fit around people rather than make people fit into government and their different service and think that be huge benefit give the serious threat that digital id pose to civil liberty and our data security and the risk of our datum be hand over to us tech giant be firmly opposed to it however be it not also real big waste of money and should the government not instead focus on the no priority of people across the country which be tackle the cost of living crisis would it not be well to push the money from this into that while safeguard civil liberty think that provide well value for taxpayer money by get service to work more quickly effectively and efficiently and by crack down on fraud and reduce error and waste be really important part of deliver for the british people fully agree with many of the point make so far and too have have many comment from constituent this scheme will not help in area of digital exclusion especially where there be poor phone coverage as there be in many part of devon and neither will it stop rogue employer who currently employ cash in hand and do not look at the book why would they look at id on phone they will not digital id must be optional could the secretary of state please assure we that it will be build along the line of sovereign ai and that we will not hand over control of system like this with information about people life to company such as palantir we absolutely will not if the hon gentleman would like to write to with more detail about area and group of people in his constituency who be digitality exclude will make commitment to do everything possible to tackle that problem think that many member have fundamentally misunderstood the proposal it be actually about put power in the hand of the citizen not the state the state already hold this information digital id will allow citizen to access it on fraud billion be lose in scam last year and billion per year be lose due to identity theft do the secretary of state see role for digital id in crack down on the grow problem of fraud and identity theft absolutely do the country that have introduce digital id have find that it help to tackle fraud people can lose form of identity and they can be use by other people the scheme will help to tackle that problem as well as make service more effective and efficient be completely opposed to digital id card as matter of principle the proposal be not in the labour party manifesto and the government have no mandate for it it be basically multibillion pound gimmick to try to address the fact that small boat arrival be up third since they come to power and they have not get the faint clue how to stop they have two very specific question to ask of the secretary of state first how much even as ballpark figure will it cost to bring in this system secondly if it be to be mandatory which would be completely wrong what would be the penalty for citizen who refuse on principle to have digital id do not know why the right hon gentleman think that people should not be require to prove that they have the right to work in this country it seem very reasonable thing to do some of people over have phone and as say in answer to previous question we be consult on how we will design and develop this whole programme further detail about costing will come out in due course on the public accounts committee we regularly hear example of government it system that be out of date inefficient and open to fraud and hacking that be the reality of it when look at other country such as estonia and denmark will the secretary of state also look at how they have completely reform and recreate modern comprehensive it system where individual have easy access in estonia as understand it an individual have the right to know which part of government have look in their it system at they my hon friend be absolutely right we will be learn lesson from those country people will be able to see who access their datum so this proposal will give they more power and control if may madam deputy speaker will reply to the second question from the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois there will not be sanction or penalty for people who do not carry digital id there will remain penalty on employer who do not obey the law and do id check but there will not be penalty on the individual be not sure however many example the secretary of state give of other country that she will convince the people of britain that mandatory id card fit with our particular value will she listen to the million who sign the parliamentary petition as well as to the fighting yorkshireman harry willcock and the churchill government of who consider the abolition of id card an important symbol of society that trust its citizen think that when the british people so many of whom now have online banking on their phone and store so much in their digital wallet look at their friend neighbour and colleague across the channel and see that many across europe have digital id as matter of course and that it make their life simple and easy their common sense will say we want bit of that as chair of the all party parliamentary group on digital identity welcome the government proposal however many of my constituent have deep concern and be seek reassurance in order to build trust in the digital id system it would help if people feel that they have choice and control over whether to use digital id or not as such will the secretary of state look again at the proposal for mandatory digital id for adult and allow people choice for non digital alternative which incidentally would offer resilience against it failure and control over their datum with decentralised or federated datum approach the prime minister have be very clear that it will be mandatory for right to work check but can confirm to my hon friend that we do not want one big centralised datum set and that it will be federate that be one of the lesson we learn from other country be sure that there be many more thing we will have to do to make sure that people data be secure but this will give people more control because they will be able to see who access their datum and that be good thing if it be not so sinister it would be quaint to hear the secretary of state say that it be international novel and modern and therefore it must be good try tell that to jaguar land rover worker customer or postmaster and postmistress will the right hon lady recognise what recognise when be the home office minister responsible for national cyber security when one concentrate datum and make it interconnect and interoperable one also concentrate risk and the risk be that people life will be damage and possibly even destroy thank the right hon gentleman for his question he have lot of experience in this area we want not only to learn from other country but to work closely with the national cyber security centre to make sure that we have the high possible standard of security where mistake have be make we can learn to put they right and we be determined to do that be very happy to meet the right hon gentleman to discuss this in more detail because we want to get this right identify rogue employer who exploit labour and dodge taxis be one thing however it make no difference whether someone hold digital id over paper id if the employer refuse to acknowledge the id could the secretary of state point to the evidence which be very interested to see of how digital id will prevent rogue employment the hon member be always rightly concerned to see the evidence and when we publish our consultation on this proposal she will see it all there it be important to understand that make id check mandatory and digital rather than solely rely on get information from individual as we do at the present can make real difference in identify those who be not do the full range of check it be not the only thing we need to tackle rogue employer and there be many other action we need to take but it be good step forward just as we oppose id card under tony blair we will oppose digital id under this labour government as they seek once again to impose this unwanted scheme on sceptical public the whole idea of digital id be an attack on our liberty and privacy it be treasure trove for hacker and those who would hoard personal datum it will do little to tackle illegal immigration and it will cost billion of pound we in scotland want nothing to do with this britcard and the scottish government will energetically oppose it my question to the secretary of state be this when we rightly and inevitably oppose and reject this will she do the usual uk thing of impose it on we anyway it be not britcard must say that be tiny bit confused because in march the scottish government publish change nation how scotland will thrive in digital world which include plan to introduce digital identity service for user to prove who they be and that they be eligible for service the hon member have well make up his mind do not know how many door have knock on in my year as labour member but do know that not single person have ever tell that what they really need to improve their life their community and the country be mandatory digital id it will not tackle irregular working it would undermine civil liberty it be divisive among the public and it will not make difference to people life why be we do it why be we burn political capital and public money on that instead of focus on the issue that really be impact our constituent worry that this be yet another huge mistake in the year that have be an mp many people have say that it can be nightmare try to talk to different bit of the public sector repeatedly have to give the same information and tell their story time and again they be concerned about illegal work in this country this be an important step forward in term of improve how the state fit around people life it do not force they to fit into the system and think that be an issue that many member across the house have in common with their constituent congratulate the secretary of state on her new position be mindful of her previous position where she mastermind the personal independence payment reform so with her proposal before we today be concerned that she be fast become the minister for lose cause in my constituency we have an awful lot of people who be digitally exclude it be really sobering will she please give we some clear example of how people will be help know of dozen and dozen of people who be against the proposal in principle but what about those who will potentially be exclude we have million digital inclusion fund that will support local organisation with grant of between and to help specific group of people who be currently digitally exclude to ensure that they can get the benefit of all manner of different private and public sector service that be available online we will announce the result of the application process shortly as always be happy to meet the hon gentleman for he to tell about the specific issue in his constituency if we need to do more to ensure that everybody be digitally include we will act well here we go again year after the conservatives abolish it say to the naysayer that our passport datum and our drive licence datum be on database so we need to be careful about throw out the baby with the bathwater we have have verify and tell we once so there have be attempt to do this and we all log into our hmrc account so we be use digital identification in many way but will the secretary of state be really careful about the challenge that some will face also why on earth be it mandatory the previous proposal be for voluntary use and interestingly it be popular with migrant who really want to have that id to prove their right to access but they do not have to do so that would allow public service the time to work with those who be digitally exclude my hon friend have huge amount of experience on this issue look forward to discuss it with she the only area where we be propose the digital id to be mandatory be for right to work check interruption no we be not propose it to be mandatory for any other area believe that as people start to see those benefit they will want to have it on their phone for access public service as well as those in the private sector we have to get the security right and we have to get digital inclusion right but believe that in today world where so many of we have so much information on our phone there have be shift in opinion look forward to hear more from she about what she think we need to do next this id card be be tout as an idea to do mandatory work check it rather surprise that the right hon lady who until recently be in charge of the department for work and pensions be not aware that we already have mandatory check in order to work her statement be contradictory she say that it will give people more control over their datum but unless you be multimillionaire who do not need to work you will need to have an id card so it be not really optional at all she have fail to answer question from many mp across the house on how much it will cost can she say how much it will cost at the risk of repeat myself cost will depend on exactly the design build and delivery of the programme we will set out further detail think people would expect that those who work here have right to do so that be an important principle and one that be proud to support welcome the statement and the consultation as contribution towards modernise our public service constituent of mine be frustrate by how they can not interact with the state alongside my hon friend the member for bassetlaw jo white go on the recent trip to tallinn and be strike by not just how digital identity could make thing easy but how it could drive the uptake of thing like childcare and pension credit and actually provide service to people be also take by the fact that in tallinn the identity system be develop to stop the overreach of the state and civil liberty be build into it will my right hon friend ensure that control and datum use be real part of the consultation agree with my hon friend that this could give people more power and control over their datum who see it and who use it as well as all the other benefit he rightly set out the british people do not vote for two tier digital police state run by this fail labour government this policy be undemocratic and authoritarian and will do absolutely nothing to stop illegal immigration will the secretary of state listen to the overwhelming volume of public opinion and drop it immediately no recall the debate about the previous attempt to bring in id card when people be concern about have to produce they if demand by authority such as the police too have be to estonia and understand that the argument have move on we now have app on our phone such as the nhs app and we have the one login so we all have digital footprint these day but can my right hon friend categorically state that that at no stage in the future will people be require by the police to produce this digital id can eu national in the uk be guinea pig for digital only status serious concern be still be raise include about access issue that result in people be wrongly deny work housing education and welfare extend digital id to the british people will result in another layer of mandatory surveillance and loss of privacy will the secretary of state confirm what independent oversight will monitor data breach error and misuse there will not be surveillance and we be not propose that it will be mandatory to access all different type of service that be just wrong characterisation of what we be propose the current proposal be that digital id will be mandatory for right to work check by the end of this parliament concern have be raise with by constituent that that make it de facto mandatory for working age people have the secretary of state consider simply stick with it as voluntary service so that people who wish to can get the benefit of streamlined id and then when it be bed in perhaps look at whether it be necessary to make it mandatory for right to work check we have consider all those different aspect it be right for the prime minister to say that it should be mandatory for right to work check by the end of the parliament to prove person right to be here and to work also believe that as we develop it and show the benefit for many other aspect of daily life for which we be not propose it will be mandatory people will see the benefit of that hope that that will start to shift the debate want to pick up the question about punishment because be confused the secretary of state say that in order to work someone will have to have digital id it will be mandatory yet she also say that the impetus will be on the company and not the individual who will not need to have one how will that work will the individual have to have one if they choose not to will that mean they can not work will it mean they have to claim benefit or will it mean they will go to prison because they do not have mandatory id no that be not what it will mean the specific question be whether there would be sanction or penalty on person for not have one and say no there will as be the case now if an employer have not do the require check it can face civil penalty of up to for each individual worker or for criminal offence up to five year in jail but there will not be penalty or sanction on the individual thank my right hon friend for her statement which set out clearly how far the uk be lag behind our european neighbour on fast and easy access to service that say my constituent have raise two main concern with and would be grateful if she could provide some reassurance one be about why they will require digital id to work when they already have national insurance number and the other be about how digital id will impact the most vulnerable resident hope that have explain why digital id need to be mandatory for right to work check and the benefit of that as one part of toolkit of thing to crack down on illegal immigration make sure that vulnerable people those who do not have smartphone or tablet or the skill have access be extremely important to we will be work closely with all the organisation that can make difference and the digital inclusion action committee and we want to look at what more we can do very locally to support group that we know have access to people would be very happy to meet my hon friend to talk in more detail about what we might be able to do to support her constituent because we be determined to make sure that britain be digitally include country through the secretary of state may thank the minister for digital government and data who be sit to she left he be in belfast last week and engage with the minister for communities in the northern ireland executive he will know and she should know that our principled and practical objection to this proposal year ago remain to this day but the secretary of state will also know that since the policy announcement there have be many fanciful and facile comment in northern ireland suggest that it would be in breach of the belfast agreement she know that ideologically practically principally politically and legally that be wrong so will she at least confirm today that nothing within the consultation will give an option to anyone to suggest that the policy if it be to be introduce would be anything other than across the united kingdom it will be across the united kingdom as the right hon gentleman say my right hon friend the minister for digital government and data be in northern ireland just last week and he also visit and talk to member of the irish government the good friday agreement and the common travel area be absolutely sacrosanct this will be uk wide proposal and nothing that we do would ever harm the good friday agreement over year ago begin career with experian data company and we be talk about have unique reference number for everybody in the country that be for the benefit of company so that they could make more money off we whereas what the government be do be look to give we access to our own datum be excite by digital id but use facebook post to ask my constituent what they think have over response which be really kind and consider order we do not have time for sorry it be order be on my foot so be seat question my question be this with all the argument for and against take into account and with trust in politician and politic at an all time low what assurance can my right hon friend give that she will work with to ensure that my constituent feel like this be be do with they rather than to they be sure that my hon friend will send the result of her survey and will look through they in detail believe that if we can show people that the government be change and that we be work around they and meet their need and concern that will be one of the way in which we can build trust and that be what we be determined to do my constituent have be crystal clear with they do not want mandatory digital id force upon they it would mark clear erosion of their civil liberty and let we face it the government track record on datum security be poor to say the least many in my constituency do not have phone signal or wi fi and roll out digital id be set to cost between billion and billion four time what the government plan to save with the family farm tax please minister learn the lesson from the welfare bill listen to your back benchers and do not waste this colossal amount of taxpayer money do not really know what the question be there thank my right hon friend for her statement and her comment on digital inclusion will she say bit more about how the inclusion strategy might address some of the challenge face by care experienced young people and care leaver will she guarantee that the priority will be bring together and integrate the public service and support that they be entitle to too often they fall between the crack of those service absolutely that be one of the issue that have already be raise with directly along with people who be homeless woman who may be flee domestic violence people who do not have access to broadband and whole range of other issue we will work closely with the group that work with care leaver but obviously we will want to talk to they ourselves be more than happy to follow up that conversation with my hon friend why do the minister think that staggering million people have already sign petition against her expensive and intrusive plan do she perhaps think that those people want she to get on with fix thing that matter to they like illegal immigration and smash the gang which this measure will do nothing to fix as the construction of her statement seem to suggest she understand will she spend her time try to sort thing that really matter to people rather than try to create problem to which there be no obvious solution at the risk of repeat myself think that try to get government service to talk to one another and work more effectively be what people want the right hon gentleman raise the issue of action on illegal immigration the home secretary have make it clear that she will do whatever it take to secure our border interruption somebody ask how it go removal be up to return of foreign national offender be up we have take the first step in our french return deal and we be invest an extra million to boost our border security there be much more to do think this be one of the tool to do it believe that it be possible for the government to tackle illegal immigration and transform our public service and give people great control over their datum the right hon gentleman government do not but this government do thirty one per cent of child in wales live in poverty and of household in wales be in fuel poverty give the scale of the crisis face people do the minister honestly believe that an intrusive and unpopular digital id system should be priority tackle child poverty be also priority as the hon lady will see when we produce our strategy the people of mid bedfordshire in response to my survey say that they do not want digital id and nor do do the secretary of state agree that the individual freedom of british people be an unacceptable price to pay for failure to enforce exist law protect our border and stop illegal working will she please answer how much this will cost if she do not know at this moment in time be it responsible of she to be push it how much this cost will depend on exactly how we design and build it believe that this will help tackle illegal immigration and help give people more control over their datum there be lot of misinformation out there about what this will and will not do do not believe it will take away people freedom do not believe that people in estonia denmark australia france and many other country believe it take away their freedom either as have be mention the petition oppose the government proposal be the fourth large that the people of this country have sign have have nearly email from my constituent oppose the scheme will the secretary of state please commit to document every single use case for the scheme and will she say how the separate island of automation across government and public service will be prepare to take advantage of single digital id all those detail will be set out in the consultation be sure that the hon gentleman and his constituent will respond to that will say once again that many other country do this they have learn from experience about security and they have learn how to keep people datum secure we will learn the lesson from what they have do and look forward to his response to the consultation have be contact by contractor who work on the last labour government id card scheme he write to that it be massive waste of money and suggest that it could be like write fujitsu blank cheque what sum be the government set aside for that cheque to the contractor to pay for the development of digital id the hon gentleman may not have hear early but say that it will be design and build in house let we be absolutely clear national digital id system create infrastructure for surveillance and control not freedom or efficiency and in the hand of future government it could be weaponise against the most vulnerable community that be not hypothetical threat history show we how identity system have be use to target the powerless we do not build tool of authoritarianism and simply hope they be never misuse will the government listen to the overwhelming public concern from more than million people many of whom be my constituent and finally scrap this draconian proposal think there be lot of misinformation out there about this proposal it be not about surveillance it be not about police state the police will not be able to stop people and require they to show their digital id in many other country where such scheme have be use it have be about make the government and the state more effective and efficient and about give people great control over their datum so that they can actually see it do not know whether the hon gentleman use search engine or whether he have any form of online banking on his phone but gently say to he that the world have move on understand that lot of people have concern but believe that there be strong case for make this happen just as it have happen in many other country respect the secretary of state greatly but honestly on this one be afraid just can not support she whatsoever say that because the opposition to this id in the united kingdom be great but in northern ireland the labour party the government and the secretary of state in particular have manage to unite all the political party against it my goodness she should do more stuff on northern ireland affair because if she can get everybody together we could do thing that be never do before say this with great respect this be not about illegal immigration this be about the nanny state it be the first step on an icy slippery slope an impose restriction by government and my constituent be say no would the secretary of state reconsider what she be put forward because really it be go nowhere in northern ireland the hon gentleman and agree on football club but it would appear that we do not agree on digital id as the hon gentleman know my right hon friend the minister for creative industries media and arts visit northern ireland last week we will work through all the different institution want to be very clear to anybody who have concern about this that it be not brit card that be not what we be call it we want to ensure that security and privacy be build in from the start the good friday agreement be absolutely sacrosanct think there be real advantage here when people see the system that we want and the benefit to their life they may reconsider their view point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker on tuesday september the chancellor and the secretary of state for science innovation and technology visit my constituency to officially open google new data centre in waltham cross an investment that be proud to have help secure when be leader of broxbourne council however not only do fail to receive notice from the science secretary that she would be accompany the chancellor who herself inform at the very last moment but not one elect representative be invite to this official event be sure that the government would not have be play politic when they fail properly to notify or broxbourne fantastic growth focus conservative run council so could you madam deputy speaker please advise how this situation can be remedie and how can hold ministers to account for obvious breach of the ministerial code the hon member have put his point on the record and someone on the government front bench will no doubt be make note in order to notify the appropriate ministers it be appropriate for colleague across the house to notify colleague when they be visit their constituency for work and political reason far to that point of order madam deputy speaker really apologise if we do not inform the hon gentleman that we be come that be an error and we will make sure that we put it right rise be this an actual point of order mr shannon indicate assent time

medical supervision staff can reverse overdose treat wound and provide hygienic injecting equipment of equal importance to the immediate medical harm reduction be the space the facility provide for expert clinician to build trusting relationship with people whom it would otherwise be hard for support service to reach those relationship can be pathway to engagement with other health and social service such as drug treatment counselling and housing service which can help address the driver of problem drug use when we visit the facility shortly after it open we be particularly impress by the expertise and dedication of the staff we meet the opening of the thistle mark radical change in approach to drug use in the uk but internationally safe drug consumption facility be not uncommon similar facility already operate in city across the world none of those facility have ever report an overdose death on the premise as part of our inquiry we visit norway and lisbon we see how safe drug consumption facility have be core part of portugal strategy to reduce drug harm we look carefully at what portugal have do give that it have achieve radical reduction in drug harm it have achieve an reduction in the number of drug relate death over the past year we also travel to oslo and bergen where we see how facility can be successfully integrate into local community above all else our report call on the uk government to adopt an evidence base approach and not to make up their mind about the thistle before the trial have conclude to that end our report also argue that expert in the evidence rather than those with preconceive idea should determine the facility future there be no statutory basis for safe drug consumption facility to open or operate in the uk instead the thistle have be able to open because of prosecutorial discretion apply by scotland lord advocate the lord advocate have decide that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute user of the facility for possession offence while the lord advocate dispensation have be crucial to enable the thistle to open our committee find that prosecutorial discretion be not substitute for consider legal framework our report also consider the cost of the thistle the scottish government have commit up to million per year to fund the facility for the duration of the three year pilot evidence to our inquiry find that facility like the thistle can be value for money generate saving elsewhere such facility reduce cost associate with public injecting hospital admission ambulance call out and treat blood bear virus for example prevent just six to eight case of hiv annually could generate saving equivalent to the annual cost of the thistle while it be right that the cost of the thistle be properly consider the context of scotland drug crisis can not be forget the committee argue that the scale of scotland emergency there be over death in alone necessitate commensurate response and significant investment while the thistle have not divert funding from other service we do hear concern during our inquiry about the need to strike the right balance between invest in service like the thistle and investing in traditional recovery service we know that safe drug consumption facility be not the only tool available for address problem drug use and we be clear in our report that this facility be complementary to and work in tandem with traditional recovery service in other word it be not an either or our report recognise that drug trend in scotland be change the facility offer supervision for only the injection of drug but inhalation be become more prevalent and can be safe method of consumption the thistle must be able to adapt to meet the need of the population it be try to help an inhalation space be currently not possible due to both reserve and devolve legislation and our report encourage the lord advocate and the scottish government to consider any future application for an inhalation room on its merit the thistle open in glasgow east end an area with long stand issue around public injecting since its opening we have hear concern about its impact particularly regard drug relate litter we know that community support be of paramount importance to the pilot success that be why consultation work be undertake about the opening of the thistle and continue through the community engagement forum when member of our committee attend community engagement forum meeting in august they be able to see that consultation work in action but we encourage the thistle to go one step far and develop more responsive communication strategy to maintain dialogue between meeting as say an independent evaluation be under way to assess the facility impact on people who inject drug local resident business and public service that include examine the service effectiveness reach cost and potential long term saving community concern must be take seriously but it be also important to allow time for the pilot local impact to be properly understand and we await the result of that evaluation which will provide an objective assessment of the thistle impact if the lord advocate continue to apply her discretion beyond the three year pilot the thistle and any future facility in scotland could continue to operate without uk government support perhaps indefinitely however the committee have find that the legal position of the pilot be fundamentally precarious and the arrangement be undesirable in the long term we therefore conclude that if the independent evaluation deem the pilot success and the thistle be to be make permanent the uk government should ensure that there be full legal framework for safe drug consumption facility in scotland be grateful to my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson who be then the home office minister with responsibility for this area for give oral evidence to our inquiry she tell we that the uk government will not introduce safe drug consumption facility and point instead to alternative ongoing intervention to address drug relate harm while those approach be need the evidence we have hear be clear that the sustained scale of scotland drug death crisis demand further action will conclude by echo the sentiment in the report that any intervention that be find to be effective at save life and reduce harm deserve the government serious consideration the committee look forward to the government response which hope will reflect serious consideration of our recommendation rise for member who be new to this back benchers may ask question for minute follow select committee statement thank our select committee chair for the statement have brief question be sure that she expect to say this but just want to say for the record that although support the report as whole there be couple of recommendation that could not support the first be the recommendation on the inclusion of an inhalation room and the second be on the provision of tourniquet can not ever support the facilitation of addiction as way of help to treat addiction just do not see that as an option why before we know the result of the pilot do the report conclude that it should be extend hope the hon lady do not mind if call she my hon friend thank she for her question think it fair to say that the issue we look at challenge we all many of we be consider issue that we have never reflect upon before so it be challenge and perfectly understand that we will have disagreement about how to go forward the thing about inhalation that be highlight to we be that for many people inhalation be safe than inject which have all sort of risk attach infected wound and blood bear virus for example inhalation do not have those problem and be become increasingly popular as method of use drug so it seem to the committee that we could encourage its consideration we be not suggest that there should be further injection space at this time we think it be important to see what the evaluation say and that any decision should be base on that particular finding but we be aware that other place in scotland be look at the thistle with interest and may well make those application although that be not the gist of the report scotland have the bad drug death figure of any nation in europe and they have increase again with suspect drug death in the first half of this year six year ago the snp scottish government declare drug death another example of soundbite announcement with no actual delivery they have have two decade to tackle this issue but the truth be that they have fail none of they be here tonight do my hon friend agree that the independent evaluation panel will determine the thistle efficacy and ultimately its future beyond the three year pilot and that that gold standard service be not an either or but must work in tandem with range of other recovery service hope that my hon friend will forgive as the impartial chair of the committee for not criticise or comment on the failing or otherwise of the snp whose member be not as he point out here this evening he be absolutely right that this be not an either or it be important that the provision be part of range of option offer if any of those option can help to reduce the drug death number in scotland they must be consider seriously and that be what we suggest thank the select committee chair very much for the report conclusion particularly the call on the government to consider secure legal footing for safe drug consumption facility from the discussion that have be have do she have any sense of the chance of less legal mechanism from the attorney general to give comfort in relation to the risk of prosecution for people use and run such facility in england and wales to be perfectly frank can not answer the hon member question because we do not take evidence on the situation elsewhere in the uk and be particularly focus on scotland as one would expect of the scottish affairs committee it may be that the prosecutorial discretion that the lord advocate have offer be something that other wish to look to but whether or not the law in england and wales would allow that be not for to say because genuinely do not know the facility be locate in my constituency the report stress the importance of engagement with the local community drug litter and public inject very close to the facility be cause of real concern for my constituent whose worry be not be properly address there be now suggestion that the facility could open for hour day cause of real worry for my constituent the community must be properly consult about material change to the facility do my hon friend agree that robust strategy be essential not only for communicate with but for listen to and address the concern of my constituent my hon friend be absolutely right to say that public confidence in the facility be paramount if it be to have future and even for the duration of the three year pilot committee member who attend the forum be very strike by the fact that although forum member from the community and local business be raise question with the operator of the thistle and those involve most closely with it there be no mechanism for response to be give between meeting we suggest that the communication strategy need to be much more responsive so that if problem be raise or good comment make the thistle can respond to it rather than wait until the next meeting that would give the public lot more confidence and reassurance that their concern be be address thank the committee chair for bring this statement forward share the concern in the question ask early about the recommendation would be concern about the addiction aspect as well but recognise that some of the problem in belfast city for instance be the same as those at the thistle pilot scheme in glasgow which the hon lady outline ever mindful of my own opinion think it would be worth while share the information from that pilot scheme with those in belfast who may have similar outlook and point of view thank the hon gentleman for his question many report have be do on international facility which he might want to bring to the attention of his colleague in belfast he be absolutely right that it be not just glasgow or scotland that have these problem although scotland seem to be suffer particularly badly there be other model in lisbon we see mobile model that accompany the fix facility that seem to be popular queue of people be wait to use it when we be there small queue but queue there be other way of address the issue and he may wish to consider those as member of the scottish affairs committee thank my hon friend for secure time for this statement the report make it clear that drug consumption room be just one of the tool that can be use to reduce drug relate harm and that one intervention must not come at the cost of another scotland sustain the high number of drug relate death in europe do my hon friend agree that lack of recovery bed and facility undermine holistic join up approach that those live with addiction deserve thank my hon friend for that question she be absolutely right it can not be one thing or another holistic attitude must be take towards eradicate drug misuse give scotland particular situation we have to be open to consider any and all option but recovery facility be certainly vital thank my hon friend and her committee for this important report the effect of drug addiction and misuse hit community hard in scotland as we have hear but also in newcastle under lyme and elsewhere in staffordshire think of the work of paul sweeney msp on the ground in glasgow he have do much on these important issue there be often enhance challenge around the stigma of drug in religious and ethnic minority community will my hon friend touch on what the outreach at thistle look like for those furth to reach community that will be particularly important for my constituent in newcastle under lyme as the government learn the lesson thank my hon friend for his question we do not look closely into that issue if someone be go to inject drug they will buy they and take they almost immediately so the reach of the thistle will never be much furth than the localise community around the building for that reason we have not look at the issue in the way that he suggest it will be interesting to see from the evaluation whether there have be more of reach than be imagine at the beginning when the facility be be scope but that be certainly not the experience that people have have until now thank the select committee for its report have be follow the international evidence on take public health approach could my hon friend set out how the centre be develop harm reduction model and how it will evaluate that be think particularly of engagement with clinician it be so important that people get the right support in the right way when they enter such centre thank my hon friend for that question it be important to understand that although prosecutorial discretion be offer by the lord advocate the thistle be quite limited in what it can offer at the moment it would like to be able to offer tourniquet for example to allow people to inject more easily it have also apply to become drug testing centre there be an increase incidence of synthetic opioid which can be very dangerous come on to the market in scotland testing would allow the police and academic to track those and take they off the street more easily thing like that can be do but permission need to be give to do they at the moment the facility do not have such permission and it be simply an inject centre that be not to say that staff be not able to refer people to other facility perhaps those where recovery or housing service be more of an option or where there be space for people to have really good wash get some clean clothe and go out feel well however at this facility people be able to talk no one leave the premise immediately after inject so people will sit around have conversation with each other and with the professional at the facility who be try hard to be really supportive special educational needs and disabilities education committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the education committee before call the chair of the committee remind hon member that question should be brief and should be direct to she and not to those on the front bench as chair of the education committee be pleased to present to the house our fifth report of this parliament solve the send crisis thank the backbench business committee for allocate time for this statement this inquiry be our first major undertaking in this parliament we choose the subject because the crisis in special educational need and disability provision send be not just challenge but moral imperative our report focus on practical step that can deliver an education system where every child regardless of their need be give the opportunity to flourish the crisis touch every corner of our education system from early year to education it affect million child and young people their family their teacher and wide range of other professional for too long child and young people have be let down by system that be fragment not fit for purpose and as consequence often too adversarial our report set out road map for change vision for an inclusive equitable and sustainable send system ground in the voice and experience of the child and family it serve over eight month we conduct rigorous inquiry put on record my thank to everyone who take part we receive over write submission and hold seven oral evidence session we hear from child and young people with send whose courage and clarity move we profoundly we hear from parent exhaust by battle for basic right from teacher stretch beyond capacity and from professional yearn to deliver but constrain by broken system we visit school in norfolk and learn from the inclusive model in ontario canada where child need not process drive support and where send provision be everyone responsibility the evidence be stark the number of child identify with send have rise by in decade to million nearly half million child have an education health and care plan and million rely on send support behind those number lie story of frustration exclusion and unrealised potential parent tell we about sleepless night navigate maze of bureaucracy and the impact on the whole family of have to fight constantly just for their child to be able to access education teacher speak of the deep frustration they experience when they be unable to meet every child need local authority describe the invidious situation they face hold the statutory responsibility for deliver for every child but without the power to do so and with funding crisis that be drive they to the edge of bankruptcy this be not what inclusion look like this be system at break point our report identify series of critical failure and offer practical evidence base solution first inclusive education remain an aspiration not reality decade after the reform there be still no shared definition of what inclusion mean without clarity school local authority and family be leave adrift with no consistent standard to aim for and no clear accountability for deliver it we call on the department for education to publish clear definition of inclusive education within three month underpin by national standard for send support and ordinarily available provision back by statutory duty and proper funding secondly trust have collapse parent and carer feel sideline blame or force into costly legal battle to secure their child right last year of send tribunal appeal be uphold damn manifestation of systemic failure we must rebuild trust through genuine partnership this mean treat parent and carer as equal partner in their child education ensure access to independent advocacy and make transparency the cornerstone of every process thirdly while there be many committed highly skilled professional who work hard every day to deliver for child there be some fundamental way in which our workforce be not equip to deliver teacher and support staff be dedicate but overstretch lack the training and resource to meet rise need special educational need co ordinator be in short supply and be too often regard as the sole person with responsibility for send support in school educational psychologist be mire in assessment prevent they from directly deliver intervention and share their expertise with other professional we propose cross departmental send workforce strategy jointly lead by the department for education and the department of health and social care to invest in training to secure the recruitment of specialist and to free professional to focus on frontline support fourthly funding be break the notional threshold for send support unchanged since its introduction in be woefully inadequate high need deficit be spiral and the statutory override be temporary plaster on deepening wound we urge the government to commission full cost benefit analysis of inclusive education and to ensure sufficient funding in the high need block to deliver early intervention which can transform life and reduce long term cost finally accountability be fail and there be structural misalignment of statutory responsibility and power we hear time and again that health and social care partner be too often absent from the send table and can not be hold to account in education accountability be unevenly distribute lead to an understandable over reliance on the statutory part of the system the education health and care plan because it be accountable we also hear that local authority do not have the power or the funding to deliver the school place that be need which be contribute to their financial pressure as they be force to purchase expensive independent school place to meet their statutory responsibility we recommend statutory duty for health and social care enforceable send tribunal power for health provision and send lead within the nhs to drive accountability statutory framework for send support and ordinarily available provision and well alignment between local authority responsibility and their ability to deliver the school place that be need to meet they we have see what be possible at aylsham high school in norfolk we witness resource base seamlessly integrate into mainstream education where every child need be meet with flexibility and care in ontario we see system where support be base on need not diagnosis and where parent be partner not adversary these be not distant dream they be model that could be emulate across our country make it absolutely clear that the statutory entitlement to an education health and care plan should remain unchanged that be commitment the government must honour during our inquiry it become crystal clear to we that if we build truly inclusive and properly resource mainstream education system we can ease the pressure and the struggle that so many family face in secure an ehcp because in setting that have whole school approach to inclusivity the need of more child be meet without have to go through that process inclusive education be not just right it be necessity it benefit every child strengthen our school and build strong community it be also cost effective reduce the long term burden on public service by invest early in child potential this report be not catalogue of despair it be call for action our recommendation offer blueprint for reform root in the live experience of child family and professional we can not afford another decade of delay so urge the government to act with urgency and ambition to work across departments to listen to those at the heart of this system to rebuild trust and to place inclusion at the core of our education system every child deserve the chance to thrive every family deserve to be hear every education set deserve the tool to succeed let we build send system that deliver not just for today but for generation to come let we make inclusion reality commend this report to the house rise order it be usual to run select committee statement for only minute member can see that many be stand to speak so some will be disappoint unless everybody keep their question short and the chair answer be also short be grateful to the hon lady and her committee for detailed and important report on subject that be of huge importance to all our constituency want to pick up particularly on parental involvement in the process which be primarily cover in paragraph to of her report too often parent feel that the process be something that be do to they rather than with they would be grateful if the hon lady could set out what immediate practical step she and her committee think can be take to move the process away from feeling like confrontation and towards more of collaboration thank the right hon member for his question which be an important one the evidence we see in ontario in canada be that where parental involvement be embed in the system partly through statutory entitlement to participation in decision about child education that build much well partnership work build trust and confidence and foster collaborative relationship between parent and professional those be the step that we have see in practice and believe can make difference in the area that the right hon member raise for the record my wife be employ as local authority senco in my local authority the london borough of bexley we have not only safety valve but an ofsted judgment of systemic failing one of which be around health service from have rewrite my own daughter ehcp on three occasion to make sure it be legally compliant and from my constituent know of those real issue with health provision paragraph and of the report contain recommendation about the involvement of health service in ehcp and in send provision could my hon friend elaborate on those recommendation and what we can do to make that provision fit for purpose know that my hon friend have extensive experience of this area not least through his own family experience be really pleased to see ministers and the secretary of state from the department of health and social care on the front bench for this statement by accident think but will take full advantage of it we hear time and time again from parent and from professional work in the send system that health have such an important role to play in the ability of child with send to access education but that health service be too often absent from the table and there be no mechanism to hold they to account it be nonsense that the send tribunal can make ruling that be bind on education but can not make ruling that be bind on health as we propose in our report that be an easy fix that would create more accountability in the health system our report contain other recommendation but we need to get this right because the consequence of not get it right be child be lock out of education there be year old child in dorking who be autistic and have have two suicide attempt the most recent within the past four week they do not have an ehcp as the chair acknowledge in the report there be serious concern about local authority governance have receive family testimony from surrey and from across the country of lawbreaking unethical and harmful behaviour by local authority relate to send how can parent have confidence that live such as that child will be save unless and until local authority be hold accountable under the law and there be swift and decisive intervention if they abuse their power the hon member raise devastating case which be sadly not unique example across the country the pressure that family face as consequence of this fail system cause further health complication not least with mental health and wellbeing he be right that there be problem with local authority ability to deliver against their statutory responsibility we highlight in our report the broken nature of the link between power and responsibility currently local authority do not have everything they need to enable they to deliver but the crisis across the system also mask local authority that be perform poorly even by the current standard believe the hon member local authority be one that face particular challenge thank the chair of the select committee for the report we agree with the recommendation that have be make do she agree that the select committee reach those recommendation by engage with community and local mp such as in corby and east northamptonshire which bring together local senco parent and other to input directly into the committee report will she thank they as do and say well do to they for shape that report and its outcome that be where it need to come from people who face these issue day in and day out make sure that this report belong to they thank my hon friend for his question it be real pleasure to meet some of his constituent who come to parliament to participate in workshop and to present their finding and their recommendation to which be then submit as evidence to our inquiry hope that his constituent will see their experience and their need reflect in our report and agree with he that part of the key to solve this enormously challenging area of public policy be well engagement with parent family and professional across the country that be how we understand where change need to take place and it be how we build trust for the future thank the chair of the select committee for her statement as part of the evidence we gather we go to ontario to see its inclusive education system and be sure be not alone in find that one of the bit of evidence that make the most impression couple of thing stand out ontario focus on communication from kindergarten because social integration be vital for child to thrive parent there do not have to fight because dialogue work well family be listen to and their trauma acknowledge all behaviour be form of communication we have to understand what these child be try to tell we do the chair of the committee agree that there be so much we can do to transform the education we offer to child with send that do not need to cost huge amount of money it just require radical shift in attitude and that start with order make the point early that in order to get as many member in as possible we have to have short question and answer thank the hon member for her question for her participation in this inquiry and for the contribution she make to our report what we see in canada show we what be possible here we see system where send education be everybody responsibility in school and across the system we see child with much high level of need than would ever be usually in mainstream school here with their need be meet well there be huge benefit for the whole school community and the wide community from that approach hope that the government will take seriously the recommendation that come from that experience in ontario thank my hon friend for her statement do she agree that improve ordinarily available provision alongside effective send support can meet many pupil need without the need for an ehcp as our committee visit to aylsham high school in norwich prove do she hope as do that the government forthcoming white paper will not seek to restrict access to ehcp but instead will offer early and effective support thereby bring the need for ehcp down naturally thank my hon friend for her question and for her contribution to this report as member of the select committee the situation that we see in aylsham high be one where child need be meet across the whole school through whole school approach to inclusion the headteacher of that school tell we powerfully we be not net generator of new ehcp we be talk about what we have see be deliver and what we therefore know be possible system that deliver whole school approach to inclusion can restore the ehcp to what it be originally intend to do under the children and families act specifically to deliver support for the child with the high level of need an inclusive approach to education can work for everyone one of the key finding of the report be that there need to be clear definition of what an inclusive education mean do the chair of the select committee agree that inflexible draconian disciplinary system at secondary level apply without consideration for reasonable adjustment be one of the thing that contribute to hostile environment for child with send will the select committee consider that and how we might improve education for all child this be why we be concerned that there should be definition of inclusive education apply across number of dimension of the system so that we can think about building and the extent to which they be inclusive welcome environment about the curriculum and the flexibility that it afford to deliver for child about the expertise within the system and about other aspect of education as well the hon lady be right to say that the policy approach take by school have bearing on whether those school be accessible to the wide possible range of pupil that be why it be important for the government to set out the definition so that everyone be clear about the basis on which we be work start my teacher training in and continue to work as teacher and to be teacher trade unionist until july last year know that the send system be break although do not realise quite how broken it be until open my email on day one we all know that the system be break throughout the country but it be most break in staffordshire place that have the pleasure to represent but which have the eighth high refusal rate for ehcp in the country reject more than of request it also have high rate of appeal more than double the national average at nearly and startling of those appeal be successful do my hon friend agree that if we genuinely want to solve the send crisis we must solve the problem of the postcode lottery that so disadvantage people in lichfield burntwood and the village and more widely across staffordshire my hon friend be right as we make clear in our report there be pocket of very good delivery there be school local authority and professional across the system that be do their good but there be postcode lottery in send sometimes even within different school that be very close to each other we need whole system reset so that we can secure consistent delivery for all child wherever they live backbench business baby loss call andy macnae who will speak for about minute beg to move that this house have consider baby loss be deeply privileged to be open this debate in the middle of national baby loss awareness week and in advance of the international wave of light on wednesday want to start by welcome the bereaved family who have join we in the galleries and particularly for do so at such late hour they have show fantastic stamina in sit through some fascinating business know that number be also watch online have no doubt this will for many of we be an emotive debate that will bring back many memory so say this to those in the galleries be grateful for your courage in join we and your presence lift this whole debate and this whole day know that for many of you your story be one of be let down by the system while today can not undo that hope that this national spotlight on what you have experience and our share commitment to fundamental change will be of some comfort also thank everyone in the chamber for their attendance today and for the cross party support that the debate have receive this be personal topic for and for my family our daughter mallorie be bear in with edwards syndrome condition that we be tell be not compatible with life yet she live for five day and die in my arm those day be both the hard of our life and the time that we value most we spend those day in the butterfly suite bereavement room fund by the local baby loss charity friend of serenity throughout that time we receive amazing support from the maternity team at burnley hospital want to take this opportunity to thank once again all the team at burnley and to recognise the amazing work that baby loss charity do throughout the uk the year since mallorie death have be challenge the impact of lose child do not end after week or month or year they stay with we my wife vanessa suffer depression and post traumatic stress disorder follow mallorie death and have never be able to fully recover and return to her work as health visitor for year she have have consistent difficulty in access sustain specialist mental health support instead be bounce between short term intervention and generalist her nhs career have now be terminate on ground of ill health and she be back on five month waiting list for therapy yet we count ourselves among the lucky one we have as good hospital experience as we could have have in the circumstance and time to prepare for what we know be an inevitable outcome we do not leave feel that more could have be do or that we have be let down we feel listen to and support in the week that follow sadly however as we will hear today far far too many family have have the very opposite of that experience we will hear heartbreaking account of baby who should not have die of family concern be belittle and ignore of practice that fall well below any acceptable standard and of institutional culture of denial and cover up believe that as we reach the end of today debate no one will be in any doubt that address the long term systemic failing in maternity care once and for all must be an imperative for this government let start by detail the extent of this challenge tragically baby die shortly before during or soon after birth every day every day mother know the immense grief of lose child they be expect to welcome into their life in there be baby death in total some of these be neonatal death while be stillbirth with the cause of one third of those stillbirth still unknown more broadly ectopic pregnancy affect one in while infant die every year from sudden unexplained death syndrome and evidence suggest that one in six pregnancy in the uk end in miscarriage crucially these family tragedy be not share equally throughout society ethnic minority and those live in deprivation be far more likely to experience this loss this have be know for year yet little action have be take to address it even in black baby be over twice as likely to be stillborn compare with white baby while neonatal mortality rate among black and asian baby be over one and half time high than the rate among white baby similarly baby bear to mother live in the most deprived area be twice as likely to die shortly after birth than those in the least deprive area this profound inequality must be root out these death occur amid pattern of poor culture and practice in too many of our maternity ward and trust in its to review the care quality commission find that only of maternity unit be rat as good for safety no unit be find to be outstanding and be rat inadequate or require improvement behind these figure lie litany of family tragedy in response there have be no shortage of inquiry over the last year we have see review or investigation into care in east kent morecambe bay and shrewsbury and telford as well as the ongoing review in nottingham these have reveal much and make many recommendation yet change have not come and the cycle of failure have continue it be in this context that the government have rightly decide to launch national investigation systematic and urgent national review of maternity service this be an opportunity that we must grasp and we have secretary of state who believe truly understand the urgency and importance of make it count we have the investigation be lead by chair of the high reputation we have commitment to taskforce to deliver on recommendation and we have many colleague in this place who be determined to make sure that the voice of family be hear and act on we must get this right so before hand over to colleague would like to make four key ask first the investigation must provide clear and bind step to achieve national change in maternity care particularly to tackle the inequality of outcome that be dependent on the race or wealth of the mother to this end the investigation must set out clear consistent approach to safety across all maternity unit in england which mean unequivocally define there be no shared definition of safety across maternity service the inquiry must identify the reason why past recommendation have not be implement or result in change it must be willing to address any embed cultural structural or governance factor that undermine quality safety and accountability when the investigation report and the taskforce release its action plan the government must fully resource the delivery and ensure there be robust monitoring and real accountability secondly it be crucial that the government set new national maternity safety ambition in the then government announce ambition to halve relative rate of stillbirth neonatal death maternal death and brain injury by alongside that they also announce an ambition to reduce preterm birth from to those ambition be due to expire and in any case be never on track to be meet it be stark reminder of how important this issue be that few baby would have die if the target have be reach the uk baby death rate be still considerably bad than those of the well perform country in europe to match those country sands and tommy have propose new ambition with an end date of to align with the nhs year plan apologise for the list but they include stillbirth rate of two per total birth neonatal mortality rate of per live birth for baby bear at week gestation and over preterm birth rate of with disaggregate datum for iatrogenic and spontaneous preterm birth and eliminate inequality in these outcome base on ethnicity and deprivation the government commitment to close the black and asian maternal mortality gap be welcome but it must explicitly include close the black and asian stillbirth and neonatal mortality gap establish routine data collection on miscarriage should be prioritise once that be establish an ambition to reduce the miscarriage rate should be add urge the government to be ambitious and to implement these new target which will help to guide and inform the improvement that will be make in service in the year to come thirdly we must urgently improve bereavement care for parent in hospital and the mental health support they receive after discharge lose child be devastating and compassionate care both immediately and in the long term be vital to process grief the national bereavement care pathway aim to standardise bereavement care and state that this should be give by train staff with dedicated grieve space provide opportunity for parent to have meaningful moment with their baby offer and referral for further support make since its launch nhs trust have gradually adopt the pathway with full coverage achieve in however voluntary uptake and lack of ringfence funding have lead to highly inconsistent implementation and sometimes it be entirely lacking bereaved mother describe the hospital support she receive as terrible no aftercare whatsoever feel abandon my mental health spiral due to lack of support and not know where to get help leave that hospital with broken heart bereavement support must continue post discharge have describe the challenge that my wife vanessa have face in access specialist support and she be by no mean alone sand report find that over of bereaved parent need specialist psychological support post discharge yet despite the introduction of nhs maternal mental health service in england only of bereaved parent be actually able to access it we must also recognise the additional barrier that father and partner face in access support only of service offer basic assessment to father in and those be often quite perfunctory one father explain how he be assess and recommend for psychological intervention and referral to clinic yet the only support he actually receive be leaflet outline local self help group it be not good enough and service must recognise that father and partner also grieve so urge the government to issue clear standard and national guidance for commission specialist mental health support service for bereaved parent include father and partner support must also be give to healthcare professional who can themselves be impact by baby death training remain inaccessible for many healthcare professional and staff often lack the time to attend session bereavement care training must be available during work hour and overall we must ensure staff be equip to support grieve family and to look after themselves finally want to touch briefly on the role of regulator most notably the nursing and midwifery council in an area as critical as maternity safety an effective and accountable regulator be crucial component yet issue with the nmc be long term and well document as be note in relation to the culture review of the organisation good nurse be find themselves be investigate for year over minor issue and bad nurse be escape sanction because of system that not function as well as it should such failure can have tragic consequence for instance the nmc clear midwife who have be refer to it follow the avoidable death of baby in morecambe bay in in the same midwife be link to the death of another baby and subsequently dismiss by their trust for action fundamentally below acceptable standard this can not continue and if we be to deliver on our maternity safety ambition we need an effective culturally healthy regulator the nmc still have long way to go until it could contribute in this way the government must continue to offer rigorous scrutiny demand accountability and ensure that the nmc become the regulator that nurse and midwife as well as the public as whole deserve to sum up each year baby die who should not have die every year mother be fail and harm and every year parent experience profound loss without the support to deal with it we can not continue as we be we have both an opportunity and an obligation to act this government have the chance to drive change that will be feel in the life of family for generation to do this we must deliver on the full potential of national investigation clear impactful and binding action must address systemic weakness and embed culture to ensure long term focus we must also adopt ambitious measurable target to align with the nhs year plan these step to reduce baby loss must come in tandem with compassionate system of care for those who do experience loss despite our good effort to this end the government should issue national guidance on commission specialist mental health service for bereaved parent finally the government must ensure the sector have capable and accountable regulator to ensure that professional standard be maintain take together we can make what have be story of national tragedy into one of national pride deliver compassionate and exemplary care for woman and baby when they need it most this be the challenge and the opportunity before we and we must not fall short it be great privilege to follow the hon member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae thank he for work with and the hon member for sherwood forest michelle welsh to secure the debate and thank my many colleague on the all party parliamentary group on patient safety would also like to thank the secretary of state for health and social care the right hon member for ilford north wes streeting for be here himself today it mean an enormous amount to family up and down the country to see that commitment from he know it be an issue in which he have take enormous personal interest think the most difficult meeting have when be do his job many year ago be with man call carl hendrickson who come to see few day before stand at that dispatch box to give the statement on the morecambe bay inquiry carl lose both his wife and his son at morecambe bay nhs foundation trust midwife mistake some fitting by his wife as just faint his wife die an hour later from an embolism the next day his son chester die from brain damage he come to see with his year old son conrad will never forget it because it be obviously go to be very difficult meeting and ask he whether he would like his son to sit outside with some of the civil servant while we discuss what happen he say no because he want his son to know for the rest of his life that he have take his concern about what go wrong right to the very top and ask awkward question and that be what he do owe great debt to the morecambe bay family to carl and to simon davey liza brady james titcombe and many other the american thinker margaret mead have saying never doubt that small group of thoughtful committed individual can change the world indeed it the only thing that ever have for those morecambe bay family be that small group of thoughtful committed people along with the family from mid staffs shrewsbury and telford east kent nottingham and many other place as we reflect in this very sad and meaningful baby loss awareness week about what have go wrong it be also important to remember that progress have be make since then since the morecambe bay inquiry the overall number of baby death be down by about that be about few year or two few day the nhs be well than it be about be honest about mistake there have be lot of reform we have chief inspector of hospital and cqc that be set up to call spade spade when there be poor care we have the duty of candour which will be far strengthen by the new hillsborough law we have medical examiner we have martha rule and we have freedom to speak up guardian despite those improvement there be some warning sign since the pandemic the decline in baby death have plateaue the number of maternal death have actually increase as the hon member for rossendale and darwen just say there be big inequality you be far more likely to die as black or asian mum you be far more likely to die as black or asian baby or baby from deprived background than other baby still we have third of nhs staff accord to the staff survey last year say that they be afraid to raise safety concern and half say that they do not think anything will happen if they do the thing that be so important to remember have say this to the house on many occasion be that if you be in birthing unit and present at section and something go wrong there be nothing as professional that you want more than to be open honest and transparent about what happen so that lesson can be learn and you can make sure that mistake never happen again but our system make that practically impossible we have the cqc the nmc the general medical council and the trust lawyer get involve and people worry there be jeopardy for clinician that if they be honest and open about the ordinary human mistake that anyone can make they will be punish for it the result be that the one thing that need to happen more than anything else truthfulness to the bereaved family and learn the lesson so that the tragedy be not repeat can be the very thing that do not happen at all instead we get five year legal process happen and the truth be not establish for maybe five six or seven year after that so what need to happen to put it right we all have our list of thing and echo absolutely everything that be say in the wonderful speech before mine for first of all it be absolutely essential that we get the cqc back on its foot it go badly wrong but under new leadership that the secretary of state have put in place believe it be now go in absolutely the right direction we must return to the one word rating so that parent and family know absolutely whether the care in their local hospital or nhs organisation be safe that be really important secondly we have litigation culture at the moment we spend about billion annually in maternity award for where maternity care have go wrong which be not far off the billion total cost of all nhs maternity unit it have go so badly wrong that many parent think that when something go wrong their only friend be not doctor but lawyer that can not be right we need to have much well accountability the government be rightly absolutely committed to bring back family doctor people have their own gp would make an enormous difference because at the moment there be no one inside the nhs to turn to when these thing go wrong and go back to the system of everyone have their own gp could make really big difference to that we need to support the work of brilliant charity such as tommy sands the clinical human factors group and baby lifeline in their contribution to make maternity care safe we also need to tackle the dangerous culture of normal birth which still see too many mother steer away from get surgical intervention when that would be the safe route for they and their baby those be all important change would like to say one final thing which be that we must not return to target culture have some concern about the new nhs league table know they be set up with the good of intention but safety and quality be not one of the factor that ensure move up the list know the secretary of state will take great care in the way that those be implement but think it be really important that there be always bottom line floor on safety and quality below which the system never go what really want to say to the house in conclusion be that we must not lose hope if we have the same level of maternity safety as sweden one few baby would die every day if we get to the same level as japan two few baby would die every day if we could get the nhs back on the trajectory it be on in the year lead up to the pandemic we would be able to get to care as safe as sweden in the next five or six year so it really be something within our grasp will finish by say this the nhs be set up on the premise of equality and the idea that no matter who we be whether we be rich or poor young or old from the north or the south from the city or the country everyone should be able to access the healthcare they need everyone mean every baby too we talk about safety more than any other healthcare system in the world in this very sad week when we remember all the people who have lose their dear baby and their dear love one in the process of have baby let we redouble our effort to make the nhs the safe high quality healthcare system in the world rise order will now call the next co sponsor of the debate after she have speak there will be five minute time limit as harmed mother from nottinghamshire give birth to my son by emergency section because health professional treat with utter contempt ignore and do not do as they should and then say it be all my fault my son be not put in my arm when he be bear instead he be rush over to consultant to start he breathe while wish have time to share the detail of what happen in the chamber so that other can understand the severity of fail system time do not permit to those who have lose baby we know that when the world say sorry for your loss it sound thin and distant because what be lose be not just child family have lose first breath first step first day of school and lifetime of love you they have lose hope we must stop whisper about baby loss in the shadow we must speak about the preventable error miss opportunity and systemic failure in our maternity service that have turn dream into dust grief be fact but these failure be not inevitable for too long the grief of affected family have be treat as private sorrow and an isolated tragedy but let be clear these be not isolate incident the heartbreak and loss be consequence of system that be fail where warning be miss staffing be insufficient preventable error steal precious future tragedy be sweep under the carpet and family have to fight for answer we have hear the datum and read the report and we have share our devastating story we know the truth maternity service be fundamentally break and our baby be pay the price be not ask for miracle but be demand competence safety and accountability and country where every mother who walk into delivery room know that she be in the safe hand possible and that her baby will be protect our child deserve that safety and the child yet to come deserve it too while we can not bring back the precious baby we lose we can honour their memory by ensure that their fate be never repeat we be not just mourn past but fight for future where safety be guarantee where every mother be hear and where every birth be meet with the excellence and dedication it deserve let the memory of the child we hold in our heart be the light that guide our resolve let the story be the steel in our spine we pledge to they and ourselves that we will fix maternity service and build legacy of safety so powerful that their short life will forever protect the long life of other and we will do it for good know from my own experience as harmed mother in nottinghamshire that speak out and share what be potentially the most traumatic and personal experience can be terrify and want to commend those who have speak out publicly and the hundred of family who have speak to about their experience from talk to thousand of woman and family have see the recur issue within our maternity service include culture of woman not be listen to lack of accountability and situation where baby have die in the most horrendous circumstance and family be have to fight over and over again for answer and to relive the bad moment of their life over and over again because the system in this country be quite frankly break be the first elect member in nottinghamshire to call for an independent review into maternity service at nottingham university hospitals nhs trust back in be immensely grateful to the family some of whom be in the gallery today who be lead the fight for change in nottingham we know that almost one in five stillbirth and neonatal death in this country could have be prevent through well care yet the previous government fail to act on this crisis and family across the country have suffer immensely as consequence if hear one more time that previous government minister stand up and say that they be go to do it well they do not they do not assign funding to it they give false promise to woman and baby we have real opportunity under this government to make maternity safe every woman deserve birth experience where she feel hear respect and above all safe let also be clear that this should never be an argument about natural versus surgical it should be about what be the safe option for each woman for too long the narrative have be poison by judgment we have see damaging trend of label section as failure shortcut or less way to give birth the judgment be not just unfair but dangerous the pressure create by this toxic conversation can sometimes push clinician to delay necessary lifesave procedure or make woman feel immense guilt for safe outcome let we be clear that the safe birth be the most informed birth we must ensure that every woman have access to high quality education regard birth and feel confident ask critical question about their care we need to create space where ask for help be see not as weakness but as commitment to their wellbeing and their baby health we must empower and support doctor midwife and nurse so that they can make decision purely on medical necessity and safety decision that be free from dangerous judgment include regard section that require we to have workforce in place so that clinician can do their job can make time for training and most importantly once again have time to listen key part of the conversation be continuity of care we must ensure that midwife be give time to fully understand each woman need and want by do so we can reduce the number of instance in which potentially life threaten issue be miss and woman fall through the crack continuity of care can help address disparity in maternity care when woman particularly black asian and minority woman see the same midwife throughout their pregnancy they can build relationship and ensure that their experience culture and religious need be consider that create safe place for woman to discuss sensitive issue and remove the frustration of have to repeat their story to numerous staff if we can rebalance the conversation and culture around birth and put in place system that allow for continuity of care we can reduce the harm do to baby and family continuity of care after birth will also be vital in reduce the incidence of death just after birth which disproportionately affect baby bear to mother live in the most deprived area of the uk they be twice as likely to die in their first month as baby bear to mother in the least deprive area change be so desperately need that be what family need and what they be call for it be time to listen to the bereaved and to harm family and to put they at the heart of any reform thank my hon friend for make such move speech she be an inspirational mum raise awareness of this if she will allow will raise the case of hayley patrick copeland bereaved mum who have be raise awareness of baby loss and put in place support for bereaved parent if may will also put on the record in this place for century to come the name of her child alya and aleah whom she lose will my hon friend join in remember they and in commend hayley for her inspirational work just like my hon friend raise awareness of baby loss thank my hon friend that be an important thing to say be so pleased when the secretary of state for health and social care announce rapid review of maternity service which believe he do to ensure that we get on with fix the problem that we know be there for example with continuity of care as soon as possible it be vital that we take family with we and ensure that they be listen to and treat with respect let we not waste this real opportunity to change the system that have be harm family for far too long the final key aspect that would like to address be the need for true accountability too often negligence lead to loss the failure be there for everyone to see ask those who have recently call for reduction in accountability this how can accountability be reduce to improve maternity service when it be not even there be not talk about hound midwife and obstetrician but if someone make mistake again and again as we see in nottinghamshire family have to fight for the truth mother leave hospital have be make to think that they be at fault there have to be accountability we need accountability and support to allow midwife to become great family should be clear about the process which should work with they so that they get answer and the truth without have to fight for they my hon friend be make an excellent speech and be great advocate on this subject be sure she know about the mbrrace uk mothers and babies reduce risk through audits and confidential enquiries across the uk datum it show mortality rate across the country like nottinghamshire leeds have high mortality rate in fact they be the high in the uk and high than the average those preventable baby loss be not an accident or statistical mistake do she agree that the leadership of hospital trust with such high rate need to take accountability and fix they this be not an issue for individual maternity unit this should be take on by the chief executive and those at the high level in teaching hospital absolutely agree if we have that approach in nottinghamshire the story would have be very different this start with we build culture that allow people to say this go wrong and this be why make mistake and be sorry it time to fix it we can not accept any more maternity scandal in this country of course there will be time when nothing more can be do through nobody fault but in instance where mistake be make clinician need to come forward how do we learn from mistake if they be never identify regulator such as the care quality commission the nursing and midwifery council and the general medical council need to step up the evidence be there for all to see in nottinghamshire the nmc fail the gmc fail and the cqc fail all those organisation be inform over and over again about what be happen in nottingham and nothing be do not one thing to this day no one have be hold accountable welcome the government decision to publish consultation on secondary legislation in order to modernise regulatory framework would be grateful to hear more about that ask the government to involve bereaved and harm family in the process because regulation must work for family and to work with organisation such as the royal college of midwives to ensure that clinician be involve in any reform and change there must be balance it be time for this labour government to take action what successive government have allow to unfold in maternity care tell devastating story about how little the life and experience of woman be value those of we who be make to feel completely expendable at the most vulnerable moment in our life will know that to be only too true in choose how to respond this government have powerful opportunity to send decisive message about how they view and value woman it be possible to make change every day meet fantastic organisation run by people who have use their experience to fuel their work to change life they include jo cruse from deliver better sharon luca from the luca foundation heidi eldridge from the mama academy laura corcoran from dignity care network and clo and tinuke from five more could name so many more it be truly astonishing how many people across the country from all corner of our society from mother to midwife be work themselves to the bone to improve our maternity and bereavement service they be all push for change for woman and the baby of the future this be no long just campaign it be movement and if the government and the nhs do not act now they risk be leave behind we face many crisis in our maternity service and the only way through they be together family midwife mother father nurse obstetrician charity decision maker and member of parliament must come together in this movement to fundamentally reshape our service so that safe birth continuity of care and accountability be at their centre all of we here be bind by shared heartbreaking truth no parent should have to say goodbye before hello affected family deserve more than condolence it be up to we in this chamber to demand an end to the preventable failure systemic neglect and outdated protocol that steal future grief must become the engine of change it be not enough to patch broken system we must rebuild it strong and safe than ever before for every baby whose life be too short for every family leave shatter and for every future family depend on we right now our task be clear the time for analysis be over the time for delay be over will not rest until our maternity service be fix permanently and profoundly we be fight for future in which safety be guarantee every mother be hear and every birth be meet with the excellence and dedication it deserve let the memory of the child we hold in our heart be the light that guide our resolve baby harriett baby teddy baby junior amaya baby winter maya dexter smokey baby ladybird and baby coupa the wonderful kind and funny ryan and every baby and mother impact and go too soon we must pledge to they and to ourselves that we will fix maternity service we will build legacy of safety so powerful that their short life will forever protect the long life of other and we will do it for good this baby loss awareness week we honour those child who be love and miss and we recognise the parent sibling family and friend who carry their memory every day today want to emphasise just how vital it be that we see the quality of bereavement care standardise and that this standard be mandate for every nhs trust and health board my constituent john and holly osman live in wells with their two lively child six year old twin name alex and amelia it may surprise some of my constituent that speak about john as we do not share political perspective however we share life experience with each other many of my constituent and understand one in every two people in this country the terrible loss of pregnancy or the death of baby that experience transcend all political difference some eight year ago john and holly lose their much love twin logan and lottie five month into their pregnancy logan and lottie life be short logan be with they for minute and lottie for minute holly who be in the gallery this evening tell that register their birth and death will remain one of the hard thing they have ever have to do john and holly be lucky to receive excellent bereavement care from the team at the royal united hospital at bath which in and be pilot the national bereavement care pathway be able to deliver in the forget not suite where they receive care from train bereavement midwife and spend two day with their baby make memory be something they say they probably do not realise how much they need then but that they cherish deeply now as holly highlight the power of compassionate skilled bereavement care can not be overstate it help parent begin to process trauma to create memory and to honour life however short that care do not erase loss but it bring dignity acknowledgement and foundation for healing the care that parent receive in those heartbreaking moment stay with they forever no one can turn back the clock but we can make difference through have compassion understanding and well care it shock that of bereaved parent report that they be able to access the support they need but only be able to do so through the nhs pay tribute to the nhs clinician midwife and support staff who deliver that care with tenderness and professionalism good care help parent and family begin to navigate the painful journey of bereavement whether those nhs staff who engage with the bereaved family during this journey have receive specialist bereavement training depend on where that care be be provide poor care can deepen trauma we know that bereavement leaf parent vulnerable to increase risk of develop mental health condition that be why it be essential that every bereaved parent in the uk have access to standardise high quality bereavement support include clear signpost timely referral and specialist mental health care when it be need most excellent bereavement care should not be matter of luck or postcode the national bereavement care pathway have finally be adopt voluntarily by every hospital offer maternity care in england with the last trust have adopt it last year however in scotland the pathway have be mandate by government the difficulty with voluntary adoption be exactly that it be voluntary which mean that the nine standard of care that comprise the bereavement care pathway be not national standard in england until they be mandate by the department of health and social care ask the secretary of state to consider mandate the bereavement care pathway with immediate effect so that family and friend can be reassure that care in the most difficult of circumstance will be exemplary to lottie and logan family and to the many other who have write to thank you for your courage in share the most personal of story your love for your child and your determination to help other family be gift to we all we can not take away the pain of loss but we can ensure that no parent walk through it alone welcome this important debate and thank my hon friend the members for sherwood forest michelle welsh and for rossendale and darwen andy macnae and the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt for bring to the house during baby loss awareness week this debate on grief that touch thousand who often grieve in silence will use this debate to call for uk wide perinatal death reduction programme and will talk about foetal growth restriction monitoring be really glad that the secretary of state for health be in the chamber that show his commitment this debate be well time to inform the rapid review of maternity and neonatal safety in england for many baby loss be invisible and misunderstood this week break that silence honour life cut short and stand with family who carry their baby memory every day like other member pay tribute to charity like sands tommy and the miscarriage association their work must be support and recognise speak with heavy heart to share the story of maia devlin corfield beautiful baby girl who should be here today her parent sherena and jack come to my advice surgery to tell about maia stillbirth at kingston hospital though sherena pregnancy be low risk maia show sign of growth restriction staff reassure sherena but fail to act maia be bear still on november the autopsy show she be healthy but die due to placental condition that halt her growth and breathing baby with growth issue like maia be eight time more likely to die and it be kingston foetal growth monitoring system that fail she it diverge from national standard and despite early warning many unsafe practice like that remain the government own maternity and neonatal safety investigation into maia death make nine recommendation yet risk still persist and be not listen to sherena and jack often feel that they be not be listen to but bereaved parent need to be hear because by listen to they we can identify those area that need to change it be that culture and the regulation and standard that all need to work together to see real change freedom of information request by sherena and jack have reveal that at least trust can not properly identify baby with growth issue the issue be that many hospital use global growth monitoring system that under detect small baby in high income country like the uk because it use datum from across the world safer uk develop system base on nhs datum do exist and be use by many unit but maia be fail by outdated growth chart still in use at kingston and st george and at many other hospital key part of the system be those growth chart donald peebles nhs england clinical director for maternity have confirm that national safety alert will soon advise trust to stop use these intergrowth chart but be there system to track which hospital still use they and how can we update foetal growth monitoring system urgently have also talk to the chief nurse for the south west london integrate care board who highlight issue of midwife retention and recruitment and in particular maternity triage which need reform with universal standard that would ensure consistency of safety and access those early warning system that fail maia and be fail other just as we have mental health investment standard we should consider similar maternity service standard as well turn to the demand for change the saving babies live care bundle publish by nhs england in june outline three key element for foetal growth monitoring but they be not consistently adopt and then monitor to ensure that they be implement there be too few of those death in each trust to rely on the trust to take the action it have to be do at national level in fact it have to be do across every nation northern ireland scotland wales and england otherwise there will be inconsistency as there already be between the different nation will the minister work with counterpart across the uk to ensure that no nation fall behind will the minister meet sherena and jack to discuss how to improve maternity care and look at the finding they have we owe it to maia we owe it to every family shatter by preventable baby loss

about if it be about anything we have see progress but it be sadly not enough as my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash mention that progress have apparently plateaue since the pandemic we still see terrible inequality of outcome across different group in our society sadly give birth be not risk free but by no mean be all those baby loss inevitable many be avoidable we need to ensure that we do all we can to reduce that risk when something go wrong as sadly it have on too many occasion family deserve transparency openness and fight for improvement they need to be believe and listen to we have see problem in morecambe bay telford east kent nottingham could go on let focus briefly on nottingham as leicestershire mp many of my constituent will have be affect donna ockenden

try spaghetti bolognese and play with her favourite green tambourine those be the precious ordinary moment that make up childhood the moment that every parent treasure and that we photograph remember and hold dear gigi have be reach the magical milestone that fill parent with pride and wonder she wave for the first time she pull herself up to stand and she say da da each of those be cause for celebration and promise of all the milestone yet to come gigi parent katie and john do everything right they choose nursery that be well know in the area have positive recommendation from friend and have respectable ofsted result they visit multiple time and attend settling in session the staff seem well trained and capable it feel safe they trust that nursery with the most precious thing in their life but in may that trust be shatter gigi love and happy month old girl be leave strapped to bean bag face down without be check by the nursery staff she die at nursery the nursery be not safe it be not care and it fail gigi at the cost of her life no parent should ever have to experience what katie and john have experience no parent should have to bury their child because basic standard of care be not follow or to campaign for change that should already exist in order to protect the child who come after yet that be exactly what katie and john be do in the face of the most earth shatter loss imaginable they be campaign tirelessly for gigi and to make our nursery safe for all child as new father can not begin to comprehend the devastation that katie and john have endure when look at my daughter poppy see the same joy wonder and infinite promise that gigi bring to this world and be haunt by the knowledge that what happen to their daughter could happen to our child katie and john be not alone in their grief it be an all too common story that nationally agree standard of care be not be adhere to lead to avoidable death whether in maternity unit neonatal care nursery or crèche gigi campaign have already achieve important progress ofsted inspection will be more frequent every four year instead of every six year in collaboration with the lullaby trust the early year foundation stage statutory framework will be update to include more detailed safe sleep guidance but that can not be the end mandatory safe sleep training for all staff be need cctv should be implement in all nursery and far more ofsted inspection must be unannounced there can be no doubt that the life of baby and their family will be save if those measure be seriously consider and implement by the government as the sands and tommy policy unit report saving babies live state with political will progress be possible this government must have relentless political will in ensure that our nursery and maternity unit be the very safe of place no baby should ever lose their life at the hand of inadequate standard of care reliance on whistleblowe culture or lax inspection routine katie and john should be watch gigi grow up they should be see she start school make friend and discover who she be instead they be fight to ensure that no other parent endure their nightmare we owe it to gigi we owe it to katie and john and we owe it to every parent who trust we to keep their child safe we have to do well thank my hon friend the members for sherwood forest michelle welsh and for rossendale and darwen andy macnae for secure the debate it coincide with baby loss awareness week time when we pause to remember every baby who have be lose far too soon the week provide we with chance to take stock of this sensitive issue and to commit to support family member include father and sibling by improve service for all family affect by baby loss in there be more than baby death in the uk behind each of which be family whose life will never be the same again the pain that those family experience be the same as the pain of lose any child and they deserve to be treat with the same sensitivity as with any other bereavement although we have make significant progress over the past few decade the rate of baby death remain too high and disproportionately so in african caribbean and asian family and those from deprive background that inequality be challenge that our society our nhs and our government must address urgently our nhs maternity and neonatal service must have proper funding and training to provide care and support through service provision that recognise the medical social and emotional need of those family it also mean ensure that staff have the support to offer service with empathy and compassion and to understand that baby loss have profound impact on all member of the family every parent experience miscarriage stillbirth or neonatal loss deserve safe space where they can grieve with dignity finally take this opportunity to pay tribute to forever stars charity base in my broxtowe constituency found by michelle and richard daniels who have live experience of baby loss their strength and dedication to family who have experience baby loss have flourish into an organisation that provide understanding and comfort to hundred of family across nottingham and nottinghamshire but that should not have be leave to grieve family the creation of baby loss service memorial garden and specialist bereavement space should be standard part of our health and social care service therefore call upon the government to see this as an opportunity to design and develop improve service for family who experience baby loss my constituent sister be stillborn many year ago in situation in which my constituent mother be simply tell do worry dear you have another one next year there be no bereavement counselling and more importantly no marked grave my constituent find out some year later quite recently that his sister have be bury in communal unmarked grave it appear that because this practice go on until the late there be some such child these family have have the lifelong pain of not know where to grieve how to grieve or where to focus their attention with no chance of find it these child deserve our support and hope that this house will share my view that the government need to step in to provide small memorial so that these family can have focus for their grief and some acknowledgment that these child exist would be grateful if the house share this call which have table as an early day motion know the minister have kindly offer to meet these family and be extremely grateful for his support be very glad to be able to take part in this very moving debate and to follow so many excellent speech as we once again mark baby loss awareness week not least on behalf of myself and my story and that of my beautiful baby lucy who tragically lose back in but also on behalf of all the mps in this place woman and man who be not yet ready or able to stand and tell their story as indeed be not for so many year for almost year never speak of my loss and never tell anyone who do not know back when it have happen until help to set up the all party parliamentary group on baby loss back in year after be first elect that be along with cross party group of mps all of whom be no long in this house although baroness prentis of banbury be now in the other place tell they my story in the tea room and could point to the table that we sit around to share our story through flood of tear it be the first time have speak about it in any detail since it have happen two decade early baby loss be and think it may still be to certain extent the last great taboo that lot of parent have to navigate their way through not long thereafter be approach by one of the officer of the new all party group regard the private member bill introduce by the former member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton as those member who be around at the time will remember part of that bill cover baby loss and the lack of any recognition for stillborn baby bear before week what be in law still call late term miscarriage his private member bill try to address this through what would become know as baby loss certificate he have be approach by his constituent hayley and frazer who give birth to their son samuel at week tragically he be stillborn and they have be horrify to receive no official recognition and even bad to learn that their child be enter in the official record as miscarriage as indeed my lucy be at week and four day just few day short of the legal definition for recognition tim also cite another tragic case that of twin bear either side of that week threshold one thankfully survive and be give birth certificate but the other bear just day or so early on the wrong side of week tragically do not survive receive no official recognition and be enter in the official record as miscarriage this feel grossly wrong to all those parent and to tim as it do to and my husband when it happen to we tim set about try to change the law hence approach to see whether would be brave enough to stand here on the opposition benches as be then and tell my story as it be so relevant to the case he be try to make somehow manage to do it it be all down on record for anyone to read or watch so will not repeat it today and it involve an awful lot of tear those who have speak today have somehow manage not to be in flood of tear do it as lot of member have do today and commend they all for share their heartbreaking story we should remember though that for every member who bear witness in this chamber there be no doubt many more who be not yet ready to do so be very proud of myself back in february to give mine and lucy story in detail in that private member bill debate and for my experience and lucy all too brief life to perhaps have make difference in help to change the law and bring about the baby loss certificate which be now much treasure by so many parent it be something be still very proud of after that debate and all the publicity it garner the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt who be health secretary at the time and who pay tribute to for everything he do set up an official department of health expert working group which tim and sit on to consult on what change in the law would look like and how the baby loss certificate would work be very glad when in february just before the election the last government announce the roll out of the first ever baby loss certificate as welcome as those certificate be worry that there be still some unintended consequence as there often be when first enact new policy have be contact by catherine whose much want baby die at week through the grieve process she find comfort in know that she would get baby loss certificate for her son matthew however when she apply for that certificate she find that she be not able to add her partner name to it as he be register with gp on the scottish side of the border while relationship across the english scottish border be not common neither be they unheard of catherine ask to ask the secretary of state be very happy that he be in the chamber in person tonight what step could be take to enable both parent name to be include on baby loss certificate where those parent be register with gps in different country in the uk be sure that what have describe be an anomaly and hope the secretary of state will address it in his response due to time will leave my remark there madam deputy speaker thank you for your grace appreciate the hon lady finish her remark member will have notice that indulge the hon lady but unfortunately after the next speaker will have to reduce the time limit to four minute so that can get all member in thank the hon and right hon member for bring this debate to the chamber today thank other speaker for their move remark and it be privilege to follow the hon member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson thank she for share her story on behalf of all those untold story speak for all my family in esher and walton who have deal with baby loss their story be many their grief be unlimited and pay tribute to they and those family with we today who be intent on turn their grief into other hope your bravery humble we all today will focus on one family last week be visit by my constituent the wonderful brave parent of jimmy alderman whose story remind we that there be still so much we must do to protect our young and most vulnerable jimmy be just six week old when he die last october he have be breastfe while be carry in sling at home which many parent understandably see as practical safe and nurture tragically jimmy slip into an unsafe position and lose consciousness despite his parent desperate attempt to save he he die three day later follow the inquest the senior coroner issue prevention of future death report which find that guidance available to parent on the safe use of baby carrier and sling particularly when feeding be wholly inadequate the coroner highlight the absence of clear nhs advice the lack of visual guidance show safe versus unsafe position and the limited awareness of suffocation risk especially for newborn and premature baby in response the national childbirth trust and the lullaby trust have both update their advice warn that hand free breastfeeding or bottle feeding when use sling be unsafe particularly for baby under four month old their message be now clear that if baby need to feed they need to be take out of sling those be important step but it should not fall solely to grieve parent and charity to close such critical gap in public information national guidance must keep pace with modern parenting practice and it be vital that the nhs clearly set out the risk and good practice around baby carrier and feed safety jimmy parent have show extraordinary courage and in jimmy memory they be call for couple of simple but vital reform first they want national awareness campaign to promote the safe use of sling and carrier secondly they want consideration of tight regulation in industry standard for baby carrier safety those sensible achievable measure could save many life that be what jimmy parent be motivate by nobody should have to go through entirely preventable grief as they have will the minister agree to meet with jimmy parent and to discuss how the department of health and social care can support this campaign include through update nhs guidance national awareness initiative and review of safety standard for baby carrier by work together we can ensure that jimmy short life lead to last change and that no other parent have to endure the unimaginable pain that his family have face thank the hon and right hon member for secure today debate on such an important issue that be sadly too often overlook early this year be incredibly grateful to meet angels and rainbows local group in my lowestoft constituency run by bereaved parent who support other through the experience of baby loss put on record in this place my sincere thank for their vital work which be life affirm trauma inform and ground in the reality of grief one key issue they wish to raise today be how woman who have just lose baby be place on the same ward as those who have just give birth it feel deeply cruel that parent who have just be through the trauma of child loss should have to share the same space as joyful new mother and healthy new baby make their first cry that be why hospital should provide space away from new parent and the maternity unit so that parent can grieve in peace as my local hospital the james paget be brilliantly part of the new hospital building programme hope that its senior leadership look at the need for dedicated private space for bereavement care in its plan training be key too parent tell how vital it be for staff to receive appropriate training in how to communicate sensitively with family go through baby loss as one constituent say feel the staff be prepared or prepare on what be happen or go to happen it be as if it be taboo subject the quality of care receive by my constituent have be very inconsistent with some feeling well support and other not at all particularly once they be out of hospital one of my constituent find out at her week scan that she have suffer miss miscarriage and be give medication and tell to expect an experience similar to bad period instead she nearly pass out from the agonising pain have contraction and pass the pregnancy on her bathroom floor at home she have be give no guidance on what to do next and be not give any reassurance when she reach out for advice she be not offer follow up scan contact by midwife or signpost to counselling or specialist service leave without support she be later diagnose with ptsd unprepared staff the dearth of support service and long waiting time for counselling make this horrible situation bad and it be important to recognise that father too be suffer from that lack of support dad have tell that they even feel ignore by service while also need to support their partner in turn we must do well for everyone which be why angels and rainbows be campaign for full time bereavement midwife or bereavement support worker in every hospital for while we have one at the james paget and some really positive change have be make as result and through work with our intrepid support group sadly in may this year that role be cut despite the trust acknowledgment that the role be undoubtedly beneficial to family while all midwife need training it take lead to help to co produce change with those with live experience drive it through and then importantly sustain that change in the word of one of my constituent baby loss be not just medical event it be the loss of child dream and future without compassionate system in place the trauma of miscarriage can last lifetime with her word to close my speech be grateful for the opportunity to participate in this moving debate during baby loss awareness week commend the hon member for sherwood forest michelle welsh and for rossendale and darwen andy macnae and the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt for call this important debate have see at first hand the commitment of the right hon member for godalming and ash to these issue and applaud his dedication on thursday sit down with my constituent jamie and ellie thompson they lose their son billy on easter sunday just day short of his fifth birthday it be diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma one of the rare cancer and one of the bad it attack only child it attack the brain and it be untreatable billy be the bright most cheerful little boy he love superhero and he love rugby just like his dad his mum say that everyone who meet he fall in love one day he be play at the beach with his sister maddie and his parent and he be not his usual self five month later he be go jamie and ellie tell how their beautiful boy become angry anxious and in agony they speak of their terrible struggle to look happy in front of he before break down in the room next door one day billy say mummy can see as he slowly lose his eyesight and the use of his limb sadly mistake in palliative care mean that his last day be brutal too today his family be try to make sense of it all jamie take out his anger on play season of hard rugby ellie throw herself into her local community project in billy memory they both suffer from flashback but thankfully maddie be now eight and seem to be ok time and again have see people take tragedy in their own life to turn it to positive change for other jamie and ellie have start charity billy battalion they be fundraise to support five promising trial of dipg treatment at great ormond street hospital and ask the secretary of state to see whether there be anything that the government can do to support it this be what jamie and ellie be do to honour billy memory and it be people like they who inspire the most it be privilege to speak in the debate and thank the co sponsor and the backbench business committee for allow it to happen on the floor of the house today also thank everyone who have speak so far and so bravely whether that be share their own experience or that of their constituent these debate have true impact this issue be of profound personal significance to as it be to so many family up and down the country alongside tommy many member of this house myleene klass mbe sands and the miscarriage association have be campaign for five year for simple change first want to recognise those for whom this be not an abstract discussion but reflection of one of the hard chapter of their life to every parent who have experience the heartbreak of lose baby want to say your loss matter and your voice matter time and again investigation into maternity and neonatal care have reveal the same issue poor communication miss warning sign and family leave to fight for answer national standard of care be not be follow and too often bereaved parent be leave wonder whether lesson will ever truly be learn that be why the forthcoming national investigation into maternity and neonatal service be so important it must drive last change and urge the secretary of state who be so pleased to see in his place to ensure that there be clear national oversight of how any recommendation be implement the investigation must also take ambitious approach to improve maternal heath and reduce baby loss we need focused national strategy that set new maternity safety ambition tackle inequality and ensure consistency across all service and want to briefly mention infertility service have decide that locally commission service be simply not good enough they be not fit for purpose in some place you get nothing in other place you get three cycle of in vitro fertilisation as nice suggest in other place you have to pay thousand of pound if you be lgbt as show by joy the netflix story that be tell so well the same backward thought about infertility treatment still exist in local commissioning board that be no more so than in south yorkshire where the nhs trust be currently consult on be quote from the website view on how many cycle of ivf should be provide to people in south yorkshire and on how much gluten free produce should be prescribe have coeliac in my family and understand the struggle but to compare that to the loss of baby which many couple who go through ivf will have suffer be simply not good enough the trust own number show that the saving from reduce two cycle to one would be only year that would be less than per person in the whole icb area let we take that money centrally so that no matter where you live in the uk you have access to three chance to start family you might have suffer five miscarriage three miscarriage baby loss or stillbirth you might be be tell by your doctor not to try for baby give the risk to your life and only to get support through ivf it be simply not good enough and fertility service be also diagnostic know people who have have endometriosis polycystic ovary syndrome block tube endometrial cancer polyp or fibroid discover not through go to gynaecologist but through go to fertility doctor we should value that and not just see it as an excess cost think fertility service should be take back centrally and provide on that basis pay tribute to all the move speech we have hear so far tonight there be few loss in life more devastating than that of child it be every parent great fear but when baby die just as life be begin at the very moment when joy and expectation be at their high the pain be all the hard to bear chloe and toby from my constituency of horsham along with nine other sussex family have go through this unimaginable experience their baby die in the care of the university hospitals sussex nhs trust between and chloe and toby be not natural campaigner it be not something they ever expect or want to do they be simply grieve parent look for truth accountability and above all change university hospitals sussex like public service in general be under immense pressure staff be work in system stretch beyond capacity want to acknowledge the effort of the countless clinician midwife and support staff who show up day in day out they too have be let down by the system it be not just the family nevertheless the fact remain that something have go seriously wrong nine baby have die in circumstance that the family believe be avoidable and thus far they have not have satisfactory answer fundamentally this be about trust trust need to be restore for that to happen we first need to fully understand what go wrong understand that thing can go wrong in any profession and my own father be an obstetrician but unfortunately in obstetric the consequence can be devastating very much support the word of the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt who say that this be not about launch some kind of witch hunt which could actually get in the way of prevent further tragedy in the future because the key thing and what we need to focus on be avoid blame and openly share and fix problem however we must shine light on past mistake in sussex members of parliament from across the house be work together on this issue and look forward to continue those conversation with my colleague locally later this week however the trust itself acknowledge that improvement be need and welcome the work already under way to make maternity care safe however if this review be to succeed and to carry the confidence of the very people it be mean to serve it must be guide by the right person the government have appoint baroness amos to lead the review she command great respect and have no question about her personal ability or integrity however as have say the key issue here be trust and in that respect she be not the right choice for sussex ask the secretary of state for health to listen to what the family be say in sussex which be that donna ockenden be appoint to oversee the review at university hospitals sussex thank my hon friend for highlight the trust that donna ockenden have build through the work she have do with those sussex family and indeed family in nottingham shrewsbury and telford her report in lay out immediate and essential action she deliberately do not call they recommendation they be action that need to be take they must be deliver in full so do my hon friend agree with that we can not lose any more time and that those action need to happen alongside the inquiry that be now take place we can not afford to delay and these family deserve to see those action implement now thank my hon friend and fellow sussex mp for her intervention and very much agree with she donna be midwife herself and she have be personally involve with the family in sussex the point that the hon member be make about the choice of people to oversee the review or inquiry reflect the point make to by two of my constituent amarjit and mandip who would have their daughter with they today be it not for failure at the leeds general infirmary the point they make to be that they want any review or inquiry to be clearly and demonstrably independent from the people who have role in run the leeds teaching hospital nhs trust in the past do he agree with and my constituent on this point and do he share my hope and trust that the secretary of state will weigh that request very heavily before he meet the family thank the hon member for his intervention and yes that sound like very similar situation as have say this be all about trust understand that concern have be raise about donna workload and the risk of rely too heavily on one person but donna have indicate that she be willing to participate be sure that she would not say so unless she be confident that she could give this task the care and attention it need unless we restore trust we risk further harm further delay and further grief which none of we wish to see almost year ago my constituent lauren trevillyan lose her son olly she tell how the support just be not there not for the family not for the parent not for the child there be just not enough aftercare for people after such loss not physically and not mentally to this day lauren be still wait for response to her request for counselling lauren struggle through those dark month but now she be fight for other lauren have be the drive force behind the baby loss awareness drop in at corby library over the past week which be absolutely something we should all be behind we need to talk about this openly and honestly we have to break the taboo because sadly it be far more common than people think as have already be say in this country baby day die close to birth when talk about baby loss can not do so without raise the courage and determination of numerous family in corby who continue to campaign and fight for answer answer on rare childhood cancer on multiple miscarriage and on those bear with limb deficiency toxic waste be dump in corby and we need answer these family have question that the local authority be not prepared to answer in response to the family solicitor the council say when it be ask where the toxic waste be dump the council understand its obligation of transparency but consider the weight of public interest fall in favour of non disclosure family be concerned that those with rare childhood cancer or multiple miscarriage be in certain place in corby where whistleblower have come forward to say that toxic waste be dump it be not good enough family be entitle to answer if the local authority continue to refuse to be transparent and honest and to answer the family question then will lead their call for public inquiry we have to end the defensiveness of our public body either through their own integrity as it should be or by the hillsborough law or if need by public inquiry enough of the defensiveness it be time for answer we be determined to get they and the people of corby deserve to hear they thank the co sponsor for secure the debate and for all colleague powerful contribution so far tonight many of those contribution have focus on preventable baby loss call for lesson to be learn and for more to be do which fully support however would like to take this opportunity to shine light on the many occasion when baby loss be not preventable but where believe there be still more that could be do as society early this year my wife and have an early miscarriage it be our first pregnancy and we be extremely excited when we get the positive test result we be very quick to tell all our friend and family we have no negative sign ahead of our week scan but during that scan it become quickly apparent that something be not right we be ask whether it be possible that it could have be nine week then second staff member come in and shortly after we be tell that there be no heartbeat we be move to another room where we ask all the question that be sure many ask in this situation be there anything we could do be there anything we could do differently next time we be reassure that actually it be extremely common there be nothing we could have do and that it happen to around one in four or five people on our journey home we feel bit silly for not know that fact and for not be prepare for how common that type of miscarriage be we wonder why we have not be tell in our early antenatal appointment that it be possibility we also wonder why we have not hear that so much from friend and family or see it in conversation on the tv after that we pledge that we would talk about it more after that moment we be face with some morbid choice natural miscarriage the opportunity to take some pill or some sort of surgical procedure we be give leaflet to think about it and off we go we do not actually have the opportunity to make that choice because shortly after we find out the miscarriage start to happen naturally can only say that be not prepare for the level of brutality that that would entail we be tell that it might be like period pain but it be much more severe than that for my wife and the volume of blood be unsettling could not believe it be normal while it be happen we start google and look online for advice and we be lucky to find blog by tommy and other organisation that have be mention today which provide we with some reassurance however we still end up go to because we be concerned about the blood loss they give we some reassurance and we manage to go home with some medication and to get through that event the follow up from that traumatic incident in our life be simple phone call we have to report negative pregnancy test few week later and that be the end of the support before run out of time must add that we be keen to get on and we have since get pregnant again we have jump that week hurdle and we be now aware that the chance of miscarriage have greatly diminish so we be in well place than we be however we be still wonder about what more can be do to provide reassurance to people in that really troubling moment ask the secretary of state whether we can record every miscarriage so that we can get firm statistic about how often this happen ask he also to look at whether we can provide access for people hour day so that they do not have unsettling moment wonder if they need to attend and whether the mental health support that be in place after third miscarriage could be in place from that very first moment because it be deeply traumatic event for anybody to go through think we need to talk about it as society much more so that the next couple be prepared start by thank member for bring this important debate and thank those who have speak so bravely about their own experience of loss and harm no matter how baby die or wanted pregnancy end it be always deeply painful and traumatic for bereaved family but their suffering be particularly exacerbate when the loss of baby could have be prevent have constituent who tragically know that only too well our city be at the centre of the large maternity inquiry in nhs history and corporate manslaughter investigation due to failing by nottingham university hospitals that have lead to hundred of baby death and injury hundred of preventable tragedy many family be still wait for answer many have face contemptuous treatment not just at the time of the loss or injury of their baby but in the aftermath these family have be institutionally gaslit lie to and rob of so much and they be still have to fight for their child some have also face abhorrent racism pay tribute to the nottingham affect family group for their unwavering determination to secure accountability and change it be because of their tenacity that the review be happen at all it have be privilege to work with they and have be deeply move by their strength and selflessness in fight not only for their own family but for other in the face of such appalling institutional failure and systematic neglect also thank donna ockenden for agree to lead the review and for all her work so far be so grateful that family in nottingham have such champion fight their corner above all there must be accountability for this scandal and lesson must be learn so that no family have to go through such an avoidable tragedy again while standard of care at nuh under new leadership have improve they be still fall short and further action must be take to ensure that parent and baby receive the care that they deserve welcome the government launch of national maternity investigation to examine maternity and neonatal service across england this rapid review will consolidate previous inquiry finding and recommendation with the aim of improve the quality and safety of maternity care however be concerned that family in nottingham do not feel that they be include in the meaningful way they be promise and the government must not simply wait for the outcome of this investigation before take action be certain that the secretary of state will act on that and thank he for his ongoing genuine commitment to this the nottingham affect family group have be call for the national recommendation from the shrewsbury and telford ockenden review to be implement without delay the family also want the role of oversight body which be mean to hold trust and healthcare professional to account to be scrutinise the cqc must become more visible organisation and it must be able to bring prosecution more than three year after the offence occur the current limit be far too short and it be deny people even semblance of justice there be so much more to say but in the last few second want to pay tribute to charity in nottingham found by bereaved parent particularly zephyr and forever stars these organisation be already do the work of support grieve family but they be operate on shoestring budget and generally do not receive statutory funding we need to see that change we need to see statutory funding increase and for those allocate it to recognise that these charity be well place to provide those service as they have already build relationship of trust within our community first commend all member who have tell their personal story and share with we how their life have be touch by what have happen to they and how they have try to move on think of my mother mona who be year of age and have suffer many miscarriage my speech writer naomi obviously very busy lady have miscarriage as well we all have personal story of this whether through our family extended family or those we live with in in northern ireland there be stillbirth and infant death register and for those mum and dad my heart simply ache pay tribute to the friend and family charity such as sands and so many other who rally around those go through the unimaginable the support they provide be phenomenal and life change and that must be place on record also highlight the tremendous decision to help those who be in the early stage of grieve loss by make available baby loss certificate certificate do not mean less pain by any stretch of the imagination but it do provide validation it say that wee life exist be here and be real and that it be okay to grieve for that wee life and the promise and hope for tomorrow that have pass in northern ireland we do not yet have those certificate but my hon friend the member for upper bann carla lockhart call for they in the house just last year whether loss be feel in the fifth week the week or the magical week the fact remain that it be loss while some be able to put their word into song or poem and other release grief with the planting of tree that they can watch grow and that show they the passage of time other choose never to speak of it and all of these be valid often think of very special constituent of mine who come to some year after she have lose baby and ask how to find where the remain have be bury the hon member for corby and east northamptonshire lee barron refer to thing happen in his constituency some of the thing that happen in belfast over those year would also pose many question wish to recall the story of that lady she be part of the do talk about it generation yet for all those year she carry that grief and want to know where her baby boy be rest the baby have be take from she and she be not give the option to bury he while we both believe sincerely that he be safe in the arm of jesus she want to know where he be on this earth this be subject to which the hon member for corby and east northamptonshire refer agnes pass before could find out which of the unmarked baby graf he be in but take great comfort in know that she have finally meet he in glory now tell the story of agnes because it show the lifelong grief that can be feel believe that this debate and the one like it hold every year be not simply about what must be do they be way to tell the agneses of this world who grieve in silence that they be not alone each life be so precious and the loss must be acknowledge and feel on behalf of the mum and dad of my constituency of strangford and across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we honour those little life and the indelible little footprint leave on heart throughout the united kingdom you be here you matter you be love and you be not forget want to thank the three member who secure this debate it be of profound

who have lose baby your grief matter and your child matter this week we light candle and wear ribbon to remember they and to remind one another that love even in loss endure speak with number of hat on as the mp for morecambe and lunesdale represent all my constituent who have lose baby in pregnancy as mum of two child and as woman who have lose two much want pregnancy want to use my place here to shine light on the pain that family be feel due to baby loss and the step that the government can take and be take to help they from enforce duty of candour on public body to give bereavement leave to parent who have lose baby before week of pregnancy first welcome the national maternity investigation thank the secretary of state for his attention to it and for listen to harm family want to emphasise that on the whole maternity care in this country be safe but where it be not strong action must be take be relieve to see that my local trust morecambe bay will be part of the national investigation not least because of the experience of my constituent ryan and sarah whose baby ida be bear in and die seven day after ida die because of failing in her care know as ryan and sarah do that mistake happen healthcare worker be human but they have have to fight every step of the way to get the truth about their daughter death which feel so inhumane after the hospital trust completely inadequate internal investigation declare there to be no care issue and ida death be grade as moderate harm ryan and sarah have to approach senior coroner to get full inquest it be only at that inquest five and half year later that the trust accept that its failing have lead to ida death the thing that break my heart be that those failing have already be identify the kirkup report identify major failing which be mean to have be fix first become involved in maternity advocacy in morecambe bay after the pretty awful birth of my first child there be lot of activity in the trust in response to the kirkup finding and do believe that improvement be make but two thing never go away and think they be still harm family to this day the first thing that want to highlight be the ideological belief that certain type of birth be superior to other we hear talk of normal or physiological birth the belief that that be somehow superior to birth with intervention still harm people today the second thing be the organisational culture that lead to care organisation respond to baby death not with care respect and humility but with gross failure to investigate gross failure to act with decency and kindness and gross lack of transparency finally want to mention constituent who come to my surgery few week ago her stepdaughter be bear sleep many year ago and she and her husband recently find out that she be bury in mass public grave they know the location where she be put to rest and they really want to put marker directly on the grave site but apparently that be not allow under local council rule they be puzzle as be as to why mark one baby death be somehow disrespectful to the other baby who lie in that mass public grave be work with my constituent to try to address that be glad that the pain that family feel across our country be be recognise in this place today we can not let more baby die preventable death we can not let those loss go unacknowledged thank member in the chamber today for their work thank the right hon and hon member who secure the debate as well as those who have share their story every member here agree that the tragedy of lose child be one of the great anyone can face yet sadly it be all too common an experience nearly half the population have either experience the loss of baby or know someone who have it be with that deeply sadden thought in mind that want to pay tribute to the tireless campaigning of louise caldwell in scotland after her experience of loss she have influence the scottish government strategy on baby loss she have also succeed in get two baby loss unit open at wishaw hospital in the constituency of the hon member for motherwell wishaw and carluke pamela nash and at gilbert bain hospital with the support of my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael and our liberal democrat colleague beatrice wishart msp those dedicated facility allow mother father and family to grieve the loss of their baby in the most dignified and compassionate environment we can provide realise that this be devolved matter but be sure that everyone in the chamber understand the need for baby loss unit and along with they compassionate labour room away from the sound of happy arrival for those all over the uk who experience deliver sleep angel while dedicated space be essential we must also look at prevention find it deeply concern that we continue to see repeat failing in maternity service the ockenden report on shrewsbury and telford and the east kent inquiry highlight systemic issue include inadequate equipment crumble maternity ward weak incident management and slow triage of urgent case furthermore it be unacceptable that when my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan ask the department about progress regard implement the recommendation of the report the answer imply not only that ministers could not confirm delivery but that they have no mechanism to measure any progress make that be simply not good enough as the hon member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae highlight we need national strategy that extend across all four nation with clear baseline to ensure that mother and baby receive the care they need and deserve we need clear and transparent measure to ensure that standard be be meet and to identify when they be not because ultimately this be about protect woman and baby baby loss awareness week be an opportunity for those affect by baby loss to remember and commemorate their baby life and to highlight this deeply important subject be glad to see that we be do just that in this debate and have it not be possibly the good of our chamber pay particular tribute to my hon friend the members for sherwood forest michelle welsh and rossendale and darwen andy macnae for their very moving tribute which start the debate every year in the uk as we have hear thousand of family be affect by the heartbreak of baby loss it be grief that be often invisible to the outside world and too often silent trauma but for those live with it the impact be lifelong it touch every aspect of their be emotional physical psychological and spiritual and the structure must be in place for those who need support follow the loss of their baby in my constituency of hyndburn and haslingden the staff at east lancashire hospitals nhs trust do fantastic job they be sign up to the national bereavement pathway but as we have hear that be not statutory requirement hope that the secretary of state will consider make it statutory requirement so that access to psychological support be not postcode lottery with rise demand on maternity service additional staffing be require so that every family who experience birth trauma or baby loss can get the support that they need thank to some work that be undertake by number of lead expert at the university of lancashire include my brilliant constituent who be the perinatal mental health lead at east lancs hospital trust clare yates they develop an evidence base birth and reproductive trauma debrief service that have be design to ensure that every family could receive that support across east lancashire and it be ready for implementation give the limited resource and staffing we have not be able to roll it out but hope that event such as today debate and the renew focus on this issue from the secretary of state might change that so that the enhanced service can be offer to give the care and support that family desperately need up and down the country there be compete us for maternal fund with the result that unfortunately trauma mental health and bereavement support often get overlook with great importance give to physical health holistic baby loss trauma service make profound difference and we must recognise that support family through baby loss be absolutely essential care so urge the secretary of state to do all he can to ensure the high possible level of care in maternity service include in the devastating circumstance of miscarriage or baby loss and to ensure that that support be there for everyone who be unfortunate to experience it know that this debate be not an easy one for those of we participate and for the campaigner activist and bereaved parent who be listen but it be nevertheless vital and be very thankful that it be take place begin by commend all those include my hon friend who have lead this debate in the house and beyond who have find the courage to stand up and speak about their experience of baby loss know from personal experience just how difficult that be to do to reopen that wound and to relive that pain in public every story of baby loss tell or untold be worthy of our compassion and respect and say that because after the occasion when have share my own experience have be meet time and again with question how long ago be it how far along be you and how do you know that racism be factor perhaps some of those question be ask in innocence but let tell you how it make feel as if people be measure my loss weigh my grief and decide how much pain be allow to feel and as if there be scale for sorrow it be not one sided have speak to woman who after hear my experience have open up about their own and end by say that their experience be not as bad because mine be late term stillbirth and theirs be miscarriage that break my heart because it be not true to all those who experience baby loss in whatever form your experience matter your grief matter and your loss matter that be why baby loss awareness week be about all form of pregnancy and baby loss it be not the loss olympics whether it be an abortion someone have to have an ectopic pregnancy an early or late miscarriage stillbirth or neonatal death every single one of those experience deserve recognition and care no one absolutely no one have the right to quantify your loss for those of we who have share our story we do not do it for validation or pity we share they so that other who have endure baby loss know they be not alone no matter when or how they lose their baby we share they as call to action because in country like our the figure surround maternal mortality and baby loss should never ever be acceptable early this year lead debate in recognition of black maternal health awareness week during which highlight the racial disparity in maternity care and the fact that it have go down black and mixed heritage woman be now three time more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth down from five time when first launch the appg for black maternal health and asian woman be twice as likely regretfully this decline be not necessarily something to celebrate nor be it due to improvement in maternity care for black woman it be because the uk overall maternity mortality figure be rise more woman and baby be die in the uk now than in the last two decade black woman be likely experience even further deterioration the late finding from mbrrace uk reveal widening divide in neonatal death rate between the uk most and least deprive area black and minority ethnic people be time more likely to live in relative poverty and time more likely to live in deep poverty in plain term poverty and deprivation be cost newborn life so the combination of socioeconomic inequality and institutional racism have double impact on black woman and their baby experience of maternity care and its outcome the datum also show sharp rise in stillbirth among baby of asian heritage and black baby remain twice as likely to be stillborn urgent targeted action be need to tackle these death and health inequality and prevent avoidable death the new report from the health and social care committee on black maternal health show that the outcome of maternity care be shape by systemic failing in leadership training data collection and accountability the secretary of state will know that when the government promise to find way forward be proud and when the government make it manifesto commitment to set target to end disparity in maternity care be prouder but this have not happen the nhs year plan have come and go without specific plan for racial disparity in maternity care if that be not the time to announce target when will it be thank my hon friend the members for rossendale and darwen andy macnae and for sherwood forest michelle welsh and the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt for secure this important debate during baby loss awareness week to give those who have experience pregnancy and baby loss that voice and the feeling that they be not alone when have my son year ago be lucky to have the support of five other mum during those first tricky year with our baby however sadly for three of those mum they have also suffer the heartbreak of miscarriage for they they have support from each of we it be not silent subject they could talk and share about their loss however at the time remember think about how their partner be cop with that loss without have that same support network it be so important that both parent have the support they need after such devastating bereavement such as from organisation like ashby sands united in my constituency ashby sands be football team for man who have suffer the devastating loss of child or miscarriage one of their member tell at recent event sometimes do need to say anything the lad know how feel the football be always good but the friendship and the support get from they be what cherish in this debate it be experience that matter and my constituent sarah have ask to share these word lose baby be an incredibly difficult and isolate time to then learn that our baby death be preventable be just soul destroy feeling of guilt and regret and whether it could have be prevent mistake be make in my pregnancy incorrect measurement be record follow up scan be not arrange our care be mismanage the hospital admit if these scan have happen and measurement be record accurately we would have have different outcome at one of our most exciting and vulnerable time of our life we put our trust and care into the hand of stranger trust that we will be treat with the dignity and respect that we each deserve sarah stress the need to drive change in teaching and learn to make maternity and childbirth safe for all she welcome the rapid review and its potential to bring about much need change to maternity care across the uk but she stress the need for trauma inform approach to the consultation those who have experience that trauma will need support to engage will the secretary of state say more about how trauma will be consider in the review also welcome the rapid review my constituent can have their baby in nottingham leicester or derby as former leicestershire county councillor sit on the health overview and scrutiny committee the sad report that request be about maternity healthcare and baby loss as nottinghamshire be neighbouring trust want to understand the situation in leicestershire we receive report on baby who die in childbirth in six year period seven baby have die and seven family have deal with that devastating loss in line with the statistic on late term loss six of the mother be black or asian data indicate that neonatal mortality rate for black and asian baby be over high than for white baby will the secretary of state set out how he will work towards eliminate those stark inequality in maternity and neonatal outcome base on ethnicity and deprivation have consider number of report on maternity and have few reflection maternity healthcare need to be consider as healthcare have hear phrase such as pregnancy be an illness and give birth be natural but have also hear from mother who feel that they be not listen to and feel powerless every stillbirth neonatal death or infant death be tragedy we must make effort to prevent they from happen know that together we will fight for justice for those who deserve just little bit more time tonight will talk about laura corcoran an inspirational woman who live in my bassetlaw constituency when scan show no heartbeat she be send home to wait two week until the delivery of her baby she remember ask how do collect my baby she say that the thought of flush it down the toilet be something that she do not want to countenance with no information laura be leave feel isolated and alone and she have to rely on what she have to hand she resort to use sieve and plastic takeaway food box laura say people be give test tube to collect urine sample but when be tell to collect my baby be give nothing be angry during her recovery she channel her anger and use her engineering skill to design device that she have name the miscarriage cradle it hook on to toilet seat and collect and seal the remain so that they can be take safely to hospital her mission be for every woman to have well control give they choice of manage the miscarriage at home laura have begin actively promote the miscarriage cradle in the nhs and the royal liverpool university hospital be the first to adopt it in statement the hospital say that one recommendation of the pregnancy loss review be for nhs trust to provide woman experience pregnancy loss with compassionate clinical care kit and the miscarriage cradle tick all the box the statement also note that in the tough world of hospital finance the trust will save money because when woman have the option of manage miscarriage at home saving be make on staffing and bed space cost so far trust have adopt the miscarriage cradle and the have just get approval the northern lincolnshire and goole nhs foundation trust say go through miscarriage be one of the hard experience that anyone can face it raw painful and often feel isolate this miscarriage collection kit be more than just product it small but powerful way to help woman hold on to their dignity in moment that can feel so overwhelming those word define laura mission her focus be for every nhs hospital trust to have miscarriage cradle in stock she have ask to raise awareness of her cradle and she also ask whether she can meet the secretary of state to discuss this with he she also ask member to sign my early day motion on baby loss kit finally take this opportunity to thank joel the complete package bassetlaw charity for its support for family experience such crisis and for its fundraising initiative which have ensure that there be room at bassetlaw hospital for parent face such difficult time in their life rise order ask hon member to take their lead from the hon member for bassetlaw jo white so that can get everybody in if they keep their speech to three minute that would be very helpful thank all hon member in this evening debate particularly those who secure the debate but also the many who share their incredibly powerful story we have hear from several member about the failure at nottingham university hospital nhs trust to keep mother and their baby safe in my constituent carl everson and carly wesson be expect their daughter ladybird during the pregnancy carl and carly be tell that ladybird have fatal chromosomal abnormality trisomy also know as patau syndrome they be tell that she be incompatible with life and that if she survive the pregnancy she would live only briefly and in severe pain face with that devastating prognosis carl and carly make the agonising decision to end their pregnancy two week after ladybird funeral they be tell during an appointment that the long term culture test show normal female carrier type there be no evidence of patau ladybird have be healthy baby carl and carly later learn that ladybird death be not inevitable it be the result of misdiagnosis and failure to follow national guideline around abortion the abortion act require two doctor to form an opinion in good faith but carl and carly learn through their investigation that the second medical practitioner be at good use as rubber stamp exercise that failure lead to the loss of very much loved and want child carl and carly have spend six year fight for answer six year navigate system that should have protect they today they continue their fight for answer and be work every day to ensure that guideline around abortion be properly follow by doctor and that law be update if require the second family that have work closely with on this issue over the past year have be the sissons sarah and tony sissons do not lose their son ryan indeed ryan join we in the

the nottingham ockenden review among the nearly family affect ryan be the first child ryan should not have be the first of thousand the failure of nottingham university hospital nhs trust should have be learn long ago but they be not those responsible have not yet be hold accountable ryan should have have the chance to enjoy happy healthy childhood ladybird should be with her parent far away from house of commons debate on baby loss despite the effort make today by myself and colleague it be not possible to put into word how the failing of the nuh trust have profoundly impact so many life in our community hope deeply that this government be go to provide the justice that they deserve rise order there be now formal three minute time limit rise to speak about baby loss on behalf of those affected those who know and love and those who do not know this tragedy touch far too many family in portsmouth north and across our country we have hear today how each year in england and wales tragically around baby be stillborn and further die within their first year of life behind every statistic be grieve family mother father grandparent aunty uncle cousin and sibling whose world be change for ever around baby be bear in portsmouth each year while outcome have improve we still see the deep inequality that drive baby loss and baby bear in our most deprived community be twice as likely to die before their first birthday than those in our wealthy community many of our maternity team be work tirelessly to change that at my hospital the queen alexandra hospital the maternity service have earn unicef baby friendly gold award national hsj digital award and an nhs parliamentary award for innovation and compassionate care proof that the possibility of dedication and excellence can and do exist however such excellence should not be postcode lottery it should be national and available for all we have the knowledge to prevent many of these tragedy we have have inquiry that have produce recommendation and action about early informed and accessible antenatal care tackle health in pregnancy support maternal mental health accountability transparency openness and address inequality and listen to woman and family about their experience to ensure that their birth choice be right for mum and baby free from pressure and prejudice service must be properly fund staff and join up when nothing can be do and loss occur compassionate bereavement support be vital parent tell that small act of care include quiet room midwife who listen support group for all the family the use of language that it be baby loss not miscarriage and the opportunity to talk and be hear can all make difference however like maternity provision bereavement support vary widely and too many family be leave to cope alone often in silence this week as we mark baby loss awareness week we must stand with every parent who light candle remember name or hold in their heart the baby they never get to take home or who be not physically in their life forever but who will always be part of their family to those family know we all say you be not alone your baby be not forget and your courage give meaning to this work and to our debate as government we must work with local nhs leader public health team and charity we can not talk about break down barrier to opportunity if we do not do that in our maternity service baby loss be not inevitable but it be challenge that we as government can and must meet with compassion we must have action thank every member from across the house who have share their personal experience and those of their constituent also thank the family who have be listen to the debate in the gallery from what have be share so passionately it be clear that not every family face the same risk or receive the same care the late datum from mbrrace uk mothers and babies reduce risk through audits and confidential enquiries across the uk have already be share but feel that must repeat it as it be so deeply concern it show that baby of black ethnicity be more than twice as likely to be stillborn as baby of white ethnicity neonatal mortality rate among black and asian baby be over high than those among white baby and baby bear to mother in the most deprived area be twice as likely to die in the first month of life than those in the least deprived area access to bereavement care be also unequal the national bereavement care pathway set out what good care should look like but voluntary adoption stretch staff and lack of time for training mean that too many family miss out when mental health support be need it be even hard to access over of bereaved parent report need psychological support yet only half be able to access it through the nhs in particular father and partner be forget far too often thank the secretary of state for be in the house to listen to the debate will the government commit to eliminate inequality in maternal and neonatal outcome base on ethnicity and deprivation will they ensure that every bereaved family wherever they live and whatever their background can access high quality bereavement and mental health care will every nhs professional who support those family be give the training and time they need to do so with confidence and compassion welcome the step that the government have take include extended baby loss certificate and the improvement to parental bereavement leave set out in the employment rights bill however member from across the house like family across the country be call for the compassionate consistent and equitable care that every bereaved family deserve rise in baby loss awareness week to pay tribute to the far too many family in gedling and nottinghamshire who have suffer the devastating loss of their baby in circumstance that be entirely avoidable they place their trust in system that should have protect they and that system fail they the ockenden review of maternity service in nottingham be now support family who have be affect by neonatal death injury stillbirth and maternity death many of they be fail by the nmc fail by the gmc fail by the cqc and fail by our nhs regulation must be overhaul and accountability must improve the mother and father who have come forward in gedling and nottinghamshire have show extraordinary dignity courage and perseverance in the face of heartbreak that most of we can barely begin to comprehend yet even in the face of unspeakable loss each and every family have meet in gedling and nottinghamshire who have lose child or suffer harm during birth have remind that light always shin brightest in the dark place in the depth of their grief their pursuit of truth and change honour their child memory and stand as beacon of tremendous humanity and hope want to take moment to pay special tribute to the incredible charity volunteer and support organisation who walk alongside bereaved family day in day out they bring comfort where it be need most and we all owe they tremendous debt of gratitude in speaking of courage and compassion also want to take moment to thank my friend and neighbour the member of parliament for sherwood forest michelle welsh long before she enter this place michelle walk side by side with nottinghamshire family through year of anguish and struggle stand shoulder to shoulder with they when few other would just day ago she suffer her own loss with the passing of her beloved dad who teach she to fight always against injustice wherever she find it just day after lose her dad she be back in parliament meet bereave maternity family in thank michelle for her leadership today order the hon gentleman will know that we do not refer to member by name in this place that be the third time he have refer to the hon member for sherwood forest by her name my apology madam deputy speaker in thank my hon friend the member for sherwood forest michelle welsh for her leadership today want to say that her dad would have be so incredibly proud to sit in the gallery today to see his little girl in this chamber use the privilege of her platform to fight for those who have be fail and suffer the most unimaginable loss also pay tribute to the family who have campaign for year for change and justice we owe they far more than sympathy we owe they justice and we owe they truth order the hon gentleman have have more than three minute and want the front benchers to have some time to respond call dave robertson place on record my thank to the co sponsor of today debate and to all member who have share their personal experience it have be very difficult debate for many of we on such an important but such difficult subject like many member today be here to speak on behalf of my constituent tim and hannah lose their son zack when he be just hour old zack inquest find that there be total and complete failure in his care genuinely do not know how parent can receive an inquest verdict like that and find the strength to put themselves back together but tim and hannah do be sure that be something we will see in many of the people in the gallery today they find the strength to put themselves back together and start look to what come next zack story be that he catch group strep infection as he be bear it be incredibly to of woman have it on any give day and it be generally symptomless in adult but if it pass from mum to baby during labour it can be fatal on average one baby week in the uk die of strep infection group strep be common in mum and highly dangerous to baby but the uk do not routinely test for it during pregnancy instead we rely on risk factor to identify expect mum who have it and too often as in zack case that approach be not work be pleased that major trial the trial be under way to look at whether we would be well off routinely testing and be due to report later this year it be no overstatement to say that that trial be once in lifetime opportunity to look at our approach to the safety of baby in this situation really hope that it report and move we towards situation in which we can routinely test for this condition during pregnancy the gold standard test cost just and can save life potentially life week we must do all we can to protect baby like zack and ensure that no more parent go through what tim and hannah have have to it be real privilege to have the opportunity to speak in this debate particularly after so many powerful and profound speech and intervention from member across the house want to share the testimony of constituent who have endure an experience that affect many family yet receive very little attention hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or hie her son survive hie event during his birth hie be brain injury cause by lack of oxygen or blood flow which can lead to developmental delay intellectual and physical disability and tragically in one in five case death some of these complication can remain hidden until school age my constituent have never hear of hie at the time nor have prior to she contact but it be an all too common condition that affect three to four birth out of every in her son case it result in mild cerebral palsy she be support by wonderful charity call peeps which highlight that family affect by hie often feel that they do not belong in baby loss space many of those family experience birth trauma ptsd and complicated grief while charity such as peeps offer support to anybody affect nhs mental health support can often be restrict to just the mother this leave father and partner who be also deeply affect to cope alone support must and should be for the whole family peeps also emphasise the significant gap in long term support especially for family whose child survive but face lifelong severe disability they be leave to navigate complex need for year after the initial intensive care end the trauma be compound for family whose event may have be avoidable study in finland between and suggest that fifth of all such case could have be prevent or at least could have benefit from preventive measure this compound the trauma of affected family and underscore the importance of absolute honesty and systemic learning in our nhs service additionally hie be not always record consistently in nhs system or statistic make it hard to advocate for policy change and obscure potential disparity in outcome which we know exist for stillbirth and neonatal death we must listen to brave parent such as my constituent and fantastic charity such as peeps and ensure that hie be no long misunderstood or unheard of in conversation about baby loss we owe these family recognition compassionate care and commitment to address the lack of consistent datum that make it so hard for they to advocate for change order that bring we to the front bench contribution which will perhaps be in the region of eight minute each the hon member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae and for sherwood forest michelle welsh and the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt must be thank not just for secure this debate to mark baby loss awareness week but for their tireless advocacy to improve maternity service across the united kingdom work that they have be carry out for many year the pain of baby loss be multifacete it involve not only the unimaginable grief that accompany lose baby but the emotional and psychological suffering that come with face the prospect of life without your child future completely different from the one you have hop for lose baby can be loud fast and chaotic but it can also happen quietly almost unnoticeably some parent arrive home from the hospital to wardrobe full of baby clothe and pile of newborn toy but an empty cot other expectant mother may wake up in the morning excited to be another day close to their baby arrival only to find out that it be not mean to be half of adult in the uk say that they or someone they know have experience pregnancy or baby loss accord to sands every day in the uk baby die shortly before during or soon after birth these family as we have hear tonight have to try to pick up the piece maintain their relationship work and continue with daily commitment all while tackle the emotional and often physical trauma of their experience they often walk that path alone feel like there be nobody they can speak to about their indescribable grief or that they should not speak about it as though they themselves have somehow fail that be not the case and no woman should have to suffer in silence in the case of my constituent hannah and simon not only do they have to come to term with the fact that they would not be take their baby boy austin home from the hospital but they have to face the reality that this tragedy be avoidable and that their baby would have survive have the trust recognise and respond to concern identify in the foetal and maternal monitoring hannah and simon be not the only one connect with other parent in sussex result in they hear story from other family whose experience be concerningly similar to their own between and the university hospitals sussex nhs foundation trust pay million in compensation for medical negligence claim relate to maternity and obstetric care that be the second high amount of compensation and the third high number of claim

health hub and they have announce cut to the national service development funding for maternity service from million in to just million the following year be it any wonder therefore that the uk be underperform compare with other oecd country on infant and newborn mortality or that accord to care quality commission report in september of unit be not safe for woman to give birth in we want our

my hon friend agree that the introduction of baby loss certificate follow the pregnancy loss review under the last government be vital step in recognise bereaved parent grief and offer support on their term my hon friend be of course right those certificate have prove to be of great comfort to many the hon member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson talk about her work in that regard and thank she for it be also grateful for the work of my former colleague tim loughton one of the reason go into politic be the fact that one can make more of difference as politician than as single doctor alone the change make by my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash mean that by quite some margin he have save more baby live than have as consultant paediatrician assure the secretary of state that it be not flattery when say that he have more capacity than any nhs doctor when it come to save baby life be pleased to see he here at almost midnight know that he care and know that like all of we he want to stop the tragedy about which we have hear so much today however ask he to consider every day whether he be really do all that he can to maximise the opportunity that he have and in the spirit of constructive opposition have few question for he he say he come in with plan but in fact he take year to create the year plan which create maternity and neonatal taskforce that be task with create another plan sincerely hope that it be good plan after all this waiting but do worry that it have lose time so can he confirm when it will be publish staffing level have be mention in many tragic incident and the secretary of state have promise that he will train thousand of additional midwife look at the figure an average of few student have be accept on to midwifery degree in england across his two year in office compare with can the secretary of state confirm when he expect to train the additional midwife he promise in his manifesto the previous government increase the number of medical school place and build five new medical school as those student begin to qualify the specialist training place need to be expand and british graduate need to be prioritise the secretary of state seem to understand that at easter but what have he do about it the applicant to place ratio have rise dramatically and now strike be threaten which would threaten the care of woman and baby across the country we know that reduce baby loss start before baby be conceive and that factor such as teenage pregnancy smoking obesity and sub optimally manage chronic condition increase the risk of stillbirth we must systemically improve on factor that increase the risk of baby death welcome the fact that the secretary of state have bring through legislation introduce by the previous government to fortify bread flour with folic acid by the end of that will prevent case of neural tube defect year and improve the health of pregnant woman be also pleased to see that the tobacco and vapes bill be gradually make its way through parliament however give that the bill complete its second reading in the house of lords on april and be not due to appear in committee until october more than six month later there just do not seem to be enough urgency in the government action can the secretary of state tell we what he be do to improve pre conception advice and optimise the management of chronic condition in woman to reduce the risk of baby loss as an nhs doctor pay tribute to my colleague who welcome almost tiny miracle into the world each year however as we have hear this evening care do not always meet the high standard and too often avoidable death occur can the secretary of state assure we that the finding of the ongoing ockenden review into maternity service will be swiftly act on donna ockenden review into maternity care at the shrewsbury and telford trust find that at least baby and nine mother could have survive have they have well care from her report come million ringfence fund to improve the care available for expectant mother but as we have hear already this evening the government have slash that fund from million to just million with the rest of the money siphon off to england integrate care board the government have also reduce icb budget and be force they to restructure be worried that this un ringfencing of the budget and the distract reorganisation will have negative impact on effort to improve maternity service what be the secretary of state do to prevent negative consequence neonatal care can be lifesave one in seven baby in the uk require neonatal care but unfortunately their fight for life be not always win and baby die in neonatal care in with that in mind will the secretary of state clarify the extent to which neonatal service will be include in the maternity and neonatal investigation due by the end of the year how will the quality of neonatal care be assess the recent nhs estate review of maternity and neonatal care do not appear to include parental accommodation yet many parent find that their baby be transfer mile away for specialist care may urge the secretary of state to recognise the value of this accommodation and make sure it be widely available as many member have mention black and ethnic minority woman be more likely to suffer baby loss or maternal death can the secretary of state update we on what progress he have make on his government manifesto promise to close the maternal mortality gap for black and asian woman in the decade since the previous government launch ambition to improve maternity safety in the uk the number of stillbirth and neonatal death have reduce by almost quarter and the number of maternal death have reduce by around third these be encourage sign and they show good progress we must build on these achievement but there be so much more work to be do today we have hear many story of loss and of care failure only action will turn the page on baby loss we all wish for improved maternity and neonatal care but the secretary of state be the man with the lever to make that happen the lever to save hundred of life urge he to use they urgently thank all right hon and hon member who have take part in this extremely powerful debate thank my hon friend the member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt and my hon friend the member for sherwood forest michelle welsh for secure the debate and the backbench business committee for grant it before get into the substance of the debate since this be baby loss awareness week want to put on record my thank to the all party parliamentary group on baby loss on maternity and on patient safety for their work in raise awareness and charity such as tommy sands the miscarriage association and bliss which give bereaved family voice and incredible support and which deserve special recognition be extremely grateful to member from across the house who have name local charity run by those often with live experience who play such crucial role in improve service so that other do not have to experience the torture that they have experience it be such organisation that drive the adoption of baby loss certificate introduce by the last government and expand by this one too thank tim loughton for his work and my hon friend the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson for her leadership in this space not everyone will choose to have certificate but the option be now there for all parent who have experience lose pregnancy to have that loss recognise officially know that this have mean so much to those who have take up that option and to those who be provide the service particularly staff in the nhs business services authority who have share with ministers their pride many of they have that experience of loss themselves of be part of the solution be of course delight that the government in wales have also take up this option give the time available there be simply no way of do justice to the contribution that we have hear from member across the house and the story that they have share with we however if there be one thing have learn in my time as secretary of state work on these issue it be that word will not do any justice to these family what people want to see be action and what they need to experience be justice really do want to say heartfelt thank you to member across the house who have have the courage to share their personal story in particular my hon friend the member for rossendale and darwen by talk about his daughter mallorie have give voice to many father and partner who too often feel airbrush from the conversation and absent from consideration think it be very poignant that he open the debate for we this evening this be no exaggeration but my hon friend the member for gedling michael payne talk about the leadership of my hon friend the member for sherwood forest and it be truly extraordinary that in the aftermath of such an awful bereavement with the loss of her father she be back to work in matter of day so that she could be there with family in nottingham to support they in their ongoing campaign for justice of course my hon friend the members for sheffield hallam olivia blake and for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy and the hon member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean all share their story because other who have speak previously have the courage to share their own experience pay particular tribute to my hon friend the member for washington and gateshead south have certainly never forget her speech about lucy and she really have blaze trail for other to follow can honestly say that in the last year the most difficult meeting have be those with victim of the nhs think we should pause for moment just to reflect on how outrageous that sentence be victim of the national health service they be people who in their moment of great vulnerability place themselves and their life and the life of their unborn child in the hand of other but who instead of find themselves support and care for find themselves victim it be truly shocking have hear dozen of story each unique each tell with heartbreaking clarity and each with common theme that what should have be moment of joy become terrifying ordeal have have complete stranger describe to government minister their experience of injury endure in childbirth woman have have to share with total stranger what it have do to their sex life and what it have do to their continence have have father share with for the first time their attempt at suicide and the impact that their loss and grief have have on their mental health we also hear from my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson of the harm do to young people in this case young ryan who be with we in the gallery today have see photograph of parent child have see the ash of their child in the tiny box have see more courage than could ever imagine muster if have to walk day in their shoe each time they have meet each time they have meet anyone they have have to relive the trauma inflict on they by the state perhaps what be most shocking of all be that if there be another theme that tie these family together it be the fact that they have have to battle time and again for truth for justice for answer for accountability and for change so that other family do not have to experience what they be go through can not thank enough the member on both side of the house who have place on record not just the story but the name of the child we have lose so that they can stand on the record there for all time stain on the history of our national health service but also galvanise call to action hope there be some small comfort for family who have be with we in the chamber this evening to hear the debate or who have watch online to know that parliament be listen that we be learn and that crucially we be act many member have remark on my personal responsibility and the responsibility that weigh heavily on my shoulder to get this right we have be join by some of the nottingham family this evening when have meet they they have arrange themselves around horseshoe table in date order with those whose experience go back furthest sit to my left and those most recently sit to my right go back to nottingham regularly and honestly dread the prospect of go to another meeting with another family arrive on my right hand side at that end of the table with another story to tell but one that have happen on my watch we know how serious these situation and challenge be we have an implicit message from the system that tell woman not to have miscarriage at the weekend we have woman who be class as have normal birth still leave traumatise and scarred we still use term such as normal to describe particular type of birth for ideological reason all these thing need to change we hear from my hon friend the members for clapham and brixton hill for north west leicestershire amanda hack and for wolverhampton north east mrs brackenridge the shockingly wide race and class inequality we should not kid ourselves that these be statistical anomaly or just institutional failure because have hear time and again direct first hand experience of overt racism black woman tell that it be assume that that they would be strong black woman and so would not need so much pain relief and example of asian mother describe as diva perhaps most shockingly of all take step back and look at the overall picture we have have the normalisation of death of woman and baby we have level of loss and death in this country that be simply not tolerate in other we have shocking culture of cover up and backside covering as we have hear across the chamber this evening recognise that can not respond to every individual point that have be make in the debate will undertake to write to member across the house with detailed answer to the question they pose want to conclude by make this point which be about trust we be set out the rapid investigation lead by baroness amos because need to act urgently on the systemic challenge want to acknowledge openly and publicly that not all family be with on this many have concern and they wonder whether this will be just another review that sit on the shelf want to conclude by assure those family and this house of my personal commitment to ensure that that be not the case and not just through lead the taskforce that will implement the recommendation myself but by give promise to this house and to those family in the spirit set out by my hon friend the member for sherwood forest that grief must be the engine of change the story have hear from those family at first hand will be the steel in my spine to deliver the change they need call andy macnae to wind up thank you madam deputy speaker will speak relatively briefly would just like to thank everybody for their presence honesty and passion today this have be move deeply powerful and deeply impactive debate particularly thank the secretary of state not just for be here but for the passion anger and urgency in his speech there be million thing would like to talk about but will just reflect very briefly on the word of the hon member for dorking and horley chris coghlan about billy and billy parent and take tragedy and turn that into positive change if there be one idea that think sum up this debate it be the chance to take tragedy and turn it into positive change an action that make real difference that be the task before we and thank everyone for support it motion lapse order today petition ilkeston market place this evening be present petition in the name of samuel wilson who on december be murder in ilkeston by man drive van under the influence of alcohol and cocaine this murder be possible because of lack of appropriate anti vehicle measure on ilkeston marketplace this

motion make and question propose that this house do now poynton be pleased to have secure some parliamentary time today to highlight our superb heritage in the east of england and the role of government in support that be mindful of the very moving story we hear in the previous debate so will keep these remark fairly brief know that other want to intervene and be very happy to accept that declare an interest as co chair of the east of england all party parliamentary group begin by wish member slightly early essex day the official celebration be on st cedd day in two week time but be sure st cedd would not mind an early greeting in the seventh century cedd become the bishop of the east saxons at the request of king sigeberht the good whose territory include the mighty colchester which be proud to represent and the muddy river crossing now know as london and cedd remain the patron saint of essex as proud essex girl know that essex retain fierce and unique identity we may no long have our own king but we will shortly be elect our own mayor as part of this government commitment to devolution it be the process of devolution that be the context for tonight remark power be be reorganise in the east of england and and other colleague want to make the case for heritage and culture to be at the heart of that process the english devolution white paper issue last december say strategic authorities will also be key partner in boost culture heritage and the visitor economy support by close integration with arm length body like historic england however the consultation issue in july this year for devolution in greater essex and norfolk and suffolk say that the department of culture media and sport and its arm length body should explore deep collaborative partnership with the mayoral combine county authority many east of england mp be concerned that this language do not sufficiently prioritise heritage and culture and the economic opportunity that they present within this devolution process commend the hon member for bring forward this debate speak to she beforehand do she agree that european heritage day be supreme example of how to enjoy heritage site whether it be in the east of england or anywhere else in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the day provide free entry into many historical venue the priory in newtownards which be dominican priory build in the be one such site that can only be enter on european heritage day do the hon member agree that great affordable access for the public will only enhance and inspire new generation to know who they be and where they come from and that that be definitely worth great uk investment absolutely agree that accessibility and affordability be at the heart of much of this on the point about devolution would like to ask the minister to address this issue and to work with colleague to enhance the standing of heritage and culture within the ongoing devolution process in the east of england thank my hon friend for her generosity in give way at this late hour be not an east of england mp but be the chair of the all party parliamentary group on unesco world heritage site so this be an issue about which care passionately on the point my hon friend have just make ask the minister to bear in mind very carefully clause of the planning and infrastructure bill because we do not want that legislation to inadvertently cause second order effect and challenge for these very important site which be part of our history culture and heritage and be big part of who we be as society indeed plan regulation play an important part in preserve our heritage be sure the minister will make note of those comment the east be region rich in history in my constituency of colchester we be rightly proud of our claim to be the first city build in britain and its first roman capital we possess the old and long roman city wall the remain of the temple of claudius and britain only know roman chariot race track which be monument particularly close to my own heart think ben hur with an essex twist it be know as the colchester roman circus and be site of international importance yet continue to face planning and development pressure which speak to what my hon friend just mention and lack the sustained investment need to realise its full potential one difficulty we face at that site and at some other schedule ancient monument in my constituency be that their historic importance can be at first sight very difficult to appreciate the roman circus spectator terrace be so huge that the saxons presumably include king sigeberht find they great source of building material unfortunately their commendable recycling mean that there be nothing leave of the circus above ground as result have be in discussion with local heritage architect about the possibility of reconstruct these mighty starting gate of the circus base on design that have be find in similar building elsewhere in europe these be the gate through which charioteer and horse would have thunder at the start of every race we have run into problem however in that historic england do not seem very keen on reconstruction these day when in previous generation it may have be more keen reconstruction in some form would most likely draw many more people to the site promote local pride and energise local tourism give that would like to ask the minister to take up this issue with historic england to see if its attitude towards reconstruction can be revise in situation such as these another key site in my constituency be the former romano british settlement at gosbecks field this date from the early first century ce and be believe to have be the residence of cunobelin know to romans as king of the britons and to shakespeare as cymbeline the site include an iron age dyke which today still form part of the boundary line between my constituency and that of the right hon member for witham priti patel gosbeck be believe to be the place where ancient britons sign up or surrender depend on your view to become part of the roman empire it therefore play vital part in the history not just of our county but of the country would like to see very much more make of gosbecks the romans construct large theatre and huge temple at gosbecks but here too the brick be recycle and today there be little to see however expert and former colleague of mine at the university of essex have renowned track record in develop immersive technology and virtual and augmented reality application that could help bring gosbecks back to life for new audience think runnymede and magna carta it be of that order of magnitude there be already some interest in that from the national lottery heritage fund from green space perspective but also see many synergy with the ministerial team responsibility for culture heritage and medium with an emphasis on medium as gosbeck and site like it could provide brilliant opportunity for century interactive medium interpretation that be the gateway to more inclusive access to our heritage and culture therefore encourage the minister and the department to do more to promote such opportunity perhaps take gosbecks as use case our heritage site tell our national story connect we to the generation who come before we and offer opportunity for education and tourism and to create pride in place however they also face real and grow threat from neglect development pressure and underinvestment threat that become ever more intense under the previous government cut to local authority coffer welcome the many announcement of enhanced funding for heritage make by the government over the past year to give just few we have have million through the heritage at risk capital fund furth million through the heritage revival fund and just this week we have have detail of new million museum renewal fund those initiative empower community to take ownership of local heritage and breathe new life into neglect building when do well such project can deliver multiple return for local economy create employment aspiration and pride thank my hon friend for secure the debate do she agree that other heritage site include independently run stately home like knebworth house in my constituency receive no government funding and therefore need fair fiscal and planning framework do she agree that we need the government to provide streamlined consent for energy efficiency measure so that they can continue to support rural job tourism and climate goal agree that all those option be thing to be explore speak as former historian think that anything that enable great access to heritage be to be celebrate in the east beneficiary of some of the grant that mention include project to revitalise lowestoft town hall the former iron duke pub in great yarmouth and st george guildhall in king lynn in norfolk as we can see heritage take many form across our region in colchester work have just begin on million project to restore our magnificent victorian water tower know as jumbo the project be generously support by the national lottery heritage fund central government city and county council charitable fund and local resident it will create great visitor attraction for our city it be one of the first thing people see as they come into the city on the train but welcome as those project be they do not make up for the fact that heritage and cultural sector in the east face ongoing funding challenge much of the blame for that like so many of the challenge we face can be lay on the year of austerity after since that year overall local authority spending on heritage have drop by that be bad enough in itself but accord to figure from historic england it be down in the east by which can be catastrophic for those site spend on museum in the east be down by and on archive by by one count from an institute for public policy research report publish in july the east of england receive less heritage and cultural funding per capita than any other region just per person which be less than half the national average and just fifth of the amount in london in bring my remark to close encourage the minister to consider two broad course of action first to create dedicated regional heritage strategy for the east of england which could help shape devolve policy under the new mayoralty with clear priority and long term funding commitment that address the funding gap for heritage in our part of the country and secondly to meet to discuss how we might develop more innovative inclusive approach to preserve and celebrate our regional heritage heritage be not just about brick mortar or memory it be about identity belong and opportunity in the here and now when we invest in heritage we invest in job tourism education and community cohesion as we have hear from member around the chamber tonight there be treasure aplenty in our region and hope we can find new way to unlock their full potential with imagination investment and commitment to future generation be pleased to respond to this adjournment debate congratulate my hon friend the member for colchester pam cox on secure it and wish she very happy essex day that be something never think would say from the dispatch box but wish everyone happy essex day none the less as my hon friend lay out the east of england have unique and rich heritage it be awash with nationally significant heritage asset such as the iron age neolithic flint mine at grime graves framlingham castle and tudor lavenham and historic house such as audley end house and sandringham and of course we hear about knebworth house too the region be also home to rich roman heritage which be no more evident than in my hon friend constituency of colchester which be not only as she say britain old recorded settlement but the former roman capital with its iconic roman circus she call it ben hur but in essex be not quite sure what that film would be call but perhaps we can leave that stick to the wall madam deputy speaker want to take this opportunity to thank my hon friend for her work to preserve heritage in her constituency include the grade ii list balkerne water tower which she also mention know that she have be involve in effort to restore it and secure its future and that exciting plan be in train if there be anything the department can do to help she with those plan we stand ready to do so as my hon friend say our local heritage tell the story of who we be and form the cornerstone of our community in the present in order to preserve the past the government be proud to support community to celebrate the heritage building and asset they value and ensure that they can continue to meet their need in the present and into the future early this year my right hon friend the secretary of state mark the anniversary of the first ever art white paper and announce million of funding to fix the foundation of our art venue museum library and heritage sector in community right across the country that ambition be now start to bear some fruit my hon friend constituency have benefit directly from nearly million of arts everywhere fund to protect colchester castle for future generation enable urgent maintenance and roof repair to ensure the landmark future furthermore be pleased to say

to project in the east of england include to bring lowestoft derelict town hall back to life as fully accessible public space with an art gallery café and event venue and for the iron duke restoration project in great yarmouth which my hon friend mention bring the building back into use and create much need new job for the area be really lucky in north west cambridgeshire to represent whole variety of heritage site of different size include burghley house which visit recently century stately home that welcome thousand of visitor each year to the house itself and the garden and small site such as john clare cottage where the famous poet live the surrounding of which inspire so much of his poetry as well as welcome the local national and international tourism to those site do the minister agree that it be important that we support the educational work they do in respect of local history agriculture and the natural environment thank my hon friend for that intervention because it be true as we have already hear from my hon friend the member for colchester our heritage be about our future but it be also about learn about our past it be good for social cohesion but it be also tremendous for education and burghley house and the john clare cottage in north west cambridgeshire play vital role in that education be pleased to confirm that this year we continue historic england heritage schools programme which support teacher to bring local heritage into teaching across the curriculum hope that that continue because it be very much passion of the secretary of state and we really want to make sure that our heritage across the united kingdom be share by everyone the arts everywhere project be so important for community cohesion and for young people learn about our history and shape its future as my hon friend the member for colchester set out preserve and maintain the rich heritage of this region or any region can be expensive and challenging in addition to the funding that have
