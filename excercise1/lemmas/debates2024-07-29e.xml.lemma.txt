emergency worker how committed be she to ensure that perpetrator face the full weight of the law woman must have the protection of the law wherever they face violence that include woman emergency service worker woman police officer and woman shop worker who face violence in their job that be one of the reason why we be strengthen the law on assault against shop worker which particularly affect woman at work and why we need strong action in police too often violence against woman and girl have be see as an inevitability rather than national emergency on which we need much strong action next month the community in twickenham will once again remember amelie delagrange the french student who many member will remember be brutally murder on twickenham green some year ago sadly so little have change since then in local survey by richmond and kingston youth council of boy say that they would not intervene or would be unsure about intervene if they witness friend sexually harass someone may

partnership everywhere and anywhere to tackle these appalling crime the truly awful thing be that sometimes when terrible murder be look into authority come to the conclusion that thing could have be do to prevent the abuse or the terrible murder or crime we have to make sure that lesson be learn and that it be not groundhog day with we make the same mistake again and again call the shadow home secretary once again welcome the right hon lady to her place welcome her government commitment to halve violence against woman and girl it be an incredibly important agenda and it build on the work that the previous government my government do in this area this issue remain long stand priority for be very proud that as foreign secretary lead the international woman and girl strategy which mean that this issue be address internationally not just domestically her desire to halve incident of violence against woman and girl fit neatly with my aspiration at the time to make the united kingdom the safe place in the world to be woman or girl we have see an increase in arrest rate for violence against woman and girl they go up by between and and increase in charge rate for rape over year but we recognise that there be significant and regular under reporting of violence against woman and girl want to make sure the right hon lady agenda do not inadvertently dissuade woman from come forward so what specifically will be the metric by which we measure the halving of violence against woman and girl the shadow home secretary have make the important point that we need to be address the prevalence of violence against woman and girl not simply the reporting we know that there be many area in which report need to increase because there be often under reporting and we have work under way at the moment in order to ensure that that can be measure the right hon gentleman talk about the increase in charge rate if very small number increase by just little bit it be still very small number the charge rate be still far too low and the number of prosecution and conviction for domestic abuse be more than low than it be eight year ago this require major overhaul of the system and look forward to work with the right hon gentleman party and with all party in order to do that but we must be very honest with ourselves about the damage that have be do youth violence what step her department be take to tackle youth violence we be determined to stamp out the scourge of serious youth violence and we have set out an unprecedented mission to halve knife crime within decade we will introduce legislation to remove dangerous knife from our street and will tackle online knife sale with new sanction for technology executive whose company fail to obey the law our new young future

year old harleigh hepworth be stab to death in park when we be previously in government we use to have slogan tough on crime tough on the cause of crime give that issue such as drug abuse lack of access to adequate mental health service and cut in community provision include youth centre be consider to be cause of youth crime how will my right hon friend department use initiative such as the young future programme to tackle not only youth violence but the cause of youth violence let first offer my condolence to the family of my hon friend constituent who so tragically lose their life tackle serious violence and halve knife crime be core part of our safe street mission but to be successful it will require action across whitehall and with all partner include police probation youth service technology company charity and community organisation my hon friend mention the preventive element provide by our young future programme the young future hub will be staff by range of train professional to support young people and help to prevent they from be draw into violence asylum seeker government support what step she be take to help prevent asylum seeker from become destitute the last government lose control of the asylum system which have mean sky high asylum accommodation cost but also too many case in which people have fall through the net and end up destitute that have add to the already heavy burden that local authority have to deal with this government will get grip we have already set out plan to process asylum claim that have be stick in record high backlog and have give assurance to the secretary of state for housing communities and local government that we will take action to reset the relationship between the home office and local authority no recourse to public fund be policy that prevent most migrant in the uk from access most form of welfare support would like to see the policy scrap altogether to reduce child poverty and homelessness but at the very least will the minister stop apply it to the visa of any parent of child under to ensure that child can be adequately protect against poverty and destitution no the good way to deal with the issue of destitution in my view be to decide asylum claim quickly and accurately so that those who be entitle to work can do so and can have such recourse and those who be not can be swiftly remove retail crime what step she be take to tackle retail crime level of violence and abuse towards retail worker be unacceptably high with shoplifting epidemic plague our high street across the country that be why this government will bring in new offence of assault retail worker and end the effective immunity for shoplifting of good below unlike the conservative party we want to send message that all shoplifting be illegal and that offender will not escape punishment record rate of retail crime and shoplifting be blight our high street include in ipswich where too often such instance act as flashpoint for completely unacceptable level of violence threat and abuse direct towards retail worker very much welcome the government commitment to end the threshold for prosecute shoplifter and the introduction of stand alone offence that will give shop worker the protection they need will the minister join in ipswich to meet local retail staff so that she can hear about their experience and the vital difference that these step will make commend my hon friend for raise this issue it be true that the step we be take owe much to the work of the union of shop distributive and allied workers the co op the british retail consortium and the association of convenience stores everyone have right to feel safe at work but the march statistic show increase in shoplifting offence many of which be violent over month we welcome the operational commitment make by the police in the retail crime action plan know that the minister of state home department my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson have hear my hon friend request and that she will be happy to visit ipswich with he call the shadow minister as back bencher and chair of the all party parliamentary group on retail campaign alongside retailer and the like of usdaw to up the ante on protect retail worker know that retail worker welcome my party action on the retail crime action plan particularly the use of tagging and facial recognition technology can the minister assure we that there will be no let up in the use of facial recognition and tag to clamp down on this and other crime thank the shadow minister for his question and can confirm that we be continue to look at this issue we welcome the operational commitment that have be make by the police in the october retail crime action plan and indeed the commitment from police across england and wales to prioritise attendance where violence have be use towards shop staff antisocial behaviour what step her department be take to tackle antisocial behaviour what step her department be take to tackle antisocial behaviour what step her department be take to tackle antisocial behaviour what step her department be take to tackle antisocial behaviour what step her department be take to tackle antisocial behaviour antisocial behaviour be blight high street and town centre right across the country and our community be pay the price that be why this government have make tackle it top priority we will restore neighbourhood policing put bobby back on the beat in every corner of the country and we will introduce new respect order so that the police can get repeat offender off our street antisocial behaviour be one of the most common issue raise my constituent in bolton north east can the minister assure and my constituent that her department will take clear step to tackle the issue head on absolutely we have be very clear that we see neighbourhood police as the bedrock of restore public confidence in policing and the neighbourhood policing guarantee be crucial part of that the police have power to crack down on the antisocial use of dangerous and deafen off road bike which cause much concern in many of our constituency so that they can be seize and destroy far more swiftly thank the minister for her answer and would like to associate myself with the comment make by the home secretary in respect of southport during the election my constituent in cardiff west repeatedly raise the issue of antisocial behaviour know they will be grateful for the minister answer but can she assure that this government will work closely with the south wales police and our new police and crime commissioner emma wools to deliver on this vital mission absolutely as say in my opening answer priority for the government be tackle the scourge of antisocial behaviour we know that the police and local authority have range of power to deal with antisocial behaviour which we will strengthen through new legislation crime and antisocial behaviour be the no issue on the doorstep during the election and my constituent in birmingham northfield be pay the price for year of cut to community service and neighbourhood police figure release last week show that there be fall in record crime in birmingham last year but the number of shoplifting report be up by third will the minister arrange meeting with simon foster the west midlands police and crime commissioner and birmingham city council to discuss how respect order and other measure can reduce the crime and antisocial behaviour that be blight our community my hon friend be absolutely right about this be one of the top issue on the doorstep during the general election campaign it be worth reflect on the fact that the power in the anti social behaviour crime and policing act actually weaken the response to antisocial behaviour and for far too long the conservatives write this off as just low level crime that be why we be introduce respect order and strong power for the police to tackle persistent antisocial behaviour offender and get they out of our town centre of course would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this issue resident in the highfields area of stafford have express concern around off road vehicle be use in pedestrian area people especially the elderly and vulnerable have report feel intimidate and concerned for their safety and the safety of other could the minister please tell what the new government have plan to tackle this issue be very aware of this issue and as say in an early response we want to make sure that there be swift action to deal with it we think the neighbourhood policing guarantee get police officer back on to the beat to see what be go on will provide that reassurance stop antisocial behaviour be key and we will make sure that that happen but be happy to discuss it with my hon friend as well welcome my right hon friend and her team to their place and thank the home secretary for visit leigh prior to the election to acknowledge the issue that we face in our town as my right hon friend know our town centre be struggle with persistent antisocial behaviour often fuel by drug and alcohol abuse that be place significant strain on our police force deter resident from visit the town and cause unease in the business community welcome the home secretary measure for more policing but for fear of just move the problem along will my right hon friend outline the potential for collaboration among support agency to well manage the complex nature of these offence thank my hon friend how nice it be to see she back in her place in this house of course collaboration will be key to tackle antisocial behaviour in line with our manifesto we will be introduce powerful new respect order give the police great power to get persistent antisocial offender off our street we will also introduce zero tolerance zone through form of expedite public space protection order to prevent antisocial street drinking or local drug dealing for example from blight particular area call the shadow minister at manchester airport this past week we have see how antisocial behaviour can quickly spiral into serious violence we have also see how police officer can become subject to trial by social medium with only partial information the previous government bring forward the use of force review to give police the clarity and confidence to act in the most challenging of circumstance will the right hon lady assure the house that she will continue this important work and stand on the side of our brave officer would just say to the shadow policing minister that one of the incident he be refer to be clearly still under consideration by the independent office for police conduct and it would be wrong for to make any further comment on that at this time of course the police have our backing in the difficult job that they have to do particularly around antisocial behaviour and we will of course do what we can to support the police when they need that support call the lib dem spokesperson as the minister have say the physical presence of police officer copper on the beat be crucial to tackle antisocial behaviour but during recent year we have see the number of police officer in the highland of scotland decline hugely that be extremely worrying and do nothing for public confidence in the police force know that policing be devolve to the scottish government but may with some passion ask the minister what advice do she have for as scottish member be sure the hon gentleman do not need advice from he be quite clear that this be devolved matter so he obviously need to take it up with the scottish government and police scotland as an incoming government we recognise that have enough police on the beat and be visible be important to the public feeling safe that reassurance be vital so perhaps the hon gentleman will take it up with the scottish government and police scotland live facial recognition surveillance if she will make an assessment of the potential merit of bring forward legislative proposal to protect the right to privacy from live facial recognition surveillance facial recognition technology be be use effectively by police force to identify suspect more quickly and accurately but of course it be essential that any new technology be accompany by strong safeguard and be underpin by robust legal framework this government will give careful consideration to the overall impact of all new police technology welcome my hon friend response but facial recognition technology be be use by the police in publicly accessible place and it breach human right and discriminate disproportionately against black people the previous government fail to introduce legislation to restrict its use so can my hon friend confirm when there will be legislation to protect we will he meet and representative of civil liberty organisation to discuss this matter far understand that the national physical laboratory have independently test the algorithm that the police have be use in live facial recognition case and have find they to be highly accurate it find no statistically significant difference base on ethnicity at the setting the police generally use it be extremely important that any new technology use by the police be accompany by strong safeguard include to prevent bias or disproportionality and that robust legal framework be in place to govern the use of these new technology my hon friend still have concern and be sure the police minister my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson or will be happy to meet she asylum claim backlog what step her department be take to clear the asylum backlog what step she be take to tackle the asylum backlog after year of conservative chaos we inherit an asylum system that not only do not work but cost billion of pound we be determined to restore order to the asylum system so that it operate swiftly firmly and fairly additional caseworker will be use to clear the backlog of claim and appeal while properly enforce the rule and ensure that those with no right to be here be swiftly remove appreciate the effort that my hon friend have outline as the backlog be clear what step will the home secretary take to ensure that newly recognise refugee do not face homelessness and destitution in the week after be grant status specifically will she consider extend the move on period to day in line with the homelessness reduction act the government be aware of the need for smooth transition between asylum accommodation and other accommodation for those asylum seeker who be grant leave to remain we understand this issue and we be consider it accord to yougov poll of people support right of asylum seeker to work currently successful asylum seeker have little choice but to present to their local authority as homeless as they have no way of save for deposit or prove an income to potential landlord some council such as bournemouth christchurch and poole council of which be formerly leader have join the lift the ban coalition in support people right to work after six month accept that the minister have talk about speed thing up but two third of asylum seeker claim be currently take more than six month so it will take some time to do that right to work would reduce the homelessness burden on council and improve the mental health of asylum seeker help they to integrate with the host authority and fill vacancy in our economy will the minister work with refugee action to consider that no the answer be to speed up the asylum system so that we can get proper result much fast and swiftly remove those who do not have right to be here while ensure that those who do can be integrate and begin to work election foreign interference what step her department be take to prevent foreign interference in election it will always be government priority to protect our election against foreign interference establish process be in place to protect the uk democratic integrity include the national security act provide security service and our law enforcement agency with the tool they need to tackle state threat last week the home secretary and convene the defend democracy taskforce to consider any issue arise from the election during the recent general election some of my constituent in cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy be understandably frustrate by delay in the postal voting system understand that the electoral commission be look into this and hope that lesson will be learn our democratic system must always be protect from both domestic and foreign malign interference include misinformation will the minister update the house on the work be undertake by the defend democracy taskforce to review measure put in place to protect the general election will he also explain what effort be be make to protect our wide democratic system welcome my hon friend to her place the defend democracy taskforce meet for the first time under the new government on july the taskforce bring together ministers from across government along with representative from law enforcement and the intelligence community last week meeting discuss how political intimidation and harassment have no place in our society and how the taskforce will drive whole of government response to the full range of threat to our democracy the taskforce will bring to bear the full range of tool and capability to meet this challenge warmly welcome the appointment of the minister and congratulate he on it like he will appreciate that the security and intelligence agency be reluctant to be see to interfere in the democratic process but do he agree that step must be take to ensure that the proceed of kleptocracy in country such as russia be not use to infect democratic political party in this country and elsewhere the right hon gentleman speak with great wisdom and authority on these matter and he have huge experience of they so will not detain the house any far but say yes agree with he topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility last week crime figure show that shoplifting have increase by in year and street crime have go up by in year at time when antisocial behaviour have become serious challenge in some town centre neighbourhood police figure be down by further this be deeply damaging because community need to feel safe particularly at the heart of their community that be why this government be determined to restore neighbourhood policing the new crime and police bill announce in the king speech will include strong measure to support neighbourhood policing and to give the police strong power to crack down on shoplifting and antisocial behaviour in order to keep our street safe be grateful to the home secretary for that answer my constituent in newcastle under lyme

newcastle under lyme can well benefit from this important step in the right direction the police minister and would be very happy to talk to my hon friend about the importance of rebuild neighbourhood police in his constituency and across the country fundamentally this be about make community feel safe and about restore the confidence of local community in policing and community safety in their area call the shadow home secretary the scrutiny of government can work properly only when minister be open honest and transparent it be therefore disappointing that the home secretary have still fail to respond to my letter of july interruption well if ministers on the treasury bench do not believe that respond to letter from the opposition front bench matter that be probably something that they might like to take up with you mr speaker on the right hon lady first outing at the dispatch box her statement be late and in that statement she use unpublished figure almost week later she have still not provide any publish evidence for the figure she use my question today be simple have raise it with she previously but she have still not give an answer where be she go to send fail asylum seeker

and other who have hold we up for the former home secretary to talk about scrutiny and transparency give that he fail to tell the house that he be spend million over two and half year on send four

they do asylum seeker the use of bike and scooter have be cause an increase problem in sheffield city centre and pedestrian area they be threat now to public safety particularly when they be use by

document the harm that cause will the home secretary please confirm that the government mission to improve opportunity for all extend to refugee child and that they will amend the immigration rule accordingly think most people in this country want to see strong border security and properly control and manage asylum system where we do our bit for those who have flee persecution and conflict but where those who have no right to be here be return we do not have any of those thing at the moment that be why we be strengthen our border security and why we continue to support important route such

indeed neighbouring resident who be quite rightly feed up can the home secretary outline her plan to deal with this increase problem agree with the hon member that the problem we have see with off road bike the deafening and distressing harassment that they can sometimes cause be serious that be why this government be determined to strengthen the law on off road bike to give the police more power and to put more police on the street hope that his party will support that now in my home town of blackpool knife crime have rise since when be out with young people in blackpool few week ago they tell that it be now the norm that young people across my town carry knife will the secretary of state agree to meet to discuss this matter urgently and address the issue in blackpool my hon friend be right that we have see deeply damaging increase in knife crime that be why we be make it part of our mission on crime to halve knife crime over the next year that have to involve strong action on knife sale strong action in the law and strong prevention with the new young future programme the seasonal agricultural worker scheme remain absolutely vital for farmer largely due to the piecemeal nature of its running by the last government which mean that farmer have not be able to make the investment decision that they want to will the home secretary commit now to scheme for the

have be make as matter of urgency will the home office publish what option it be consider for the centre use and commit to timetable for tell resident when it will come to at least provisional decision that and my constituent can feed into the site be purchase by the former government understand the uncertainty that have be cause by this especially in the local community and they will want to know the home office plan for the site decision will be make on the use of the northeye site at the early opportunity and will keep the hon member inform public spending inheritance before begin my statement my thought and prayer be with those affect by the event in southport and be sure that the whole house will join in pay tribute to our emergency service who be deal with this ongoing situation on my first day as chancellor of the exchequer ask treasury official to assess the state of public spending that work be now complete and be today present it to this house in this statement will do three thing first will expose the scale and the seriousness of what have be uncover second will lay out the immediate action that we be take to deal with the inheritance and third will set out our long term plan to fix the foundation of our economy let take each of these point in turn first turn to the inheritance before the election say that we would face the bad inheritance since the second world war taxis at year high debt through the roof and an economy only just come out of recession know all of those thing and during the campaign be honest about they and about the difficult choice that they mean the british people know they too that be why they vote for change but upon my arrival at the treasury three week ago it become clear that there be thing that do not order this be an important statement for all constituent include mine if be struggle to hear it they be struggle at home as well you will all get your chance to ask question think it be more important to hear and then comment there be thing that the conservative party cover up cover up from the opposition from this house and from the country that be why today we be publish detailed audit of the real spending situation copy of which will be lay in the house of commons library take this opportunity to thank the chief secretary to the treasury my right hon friend the member for bristol north west darren jones for his leadership and treasury official for all their work in produce this document let now explain what that document have uncover the previous government publish their plan for day to day spending in the spring budget in march but when arrive at the treasury be alert by official on the very first day that that be not how much the government have expect to spend this year it be not even close in fact the total pressure on those budget across range of area be an additional billion once we account for the slippage in budget that we usually see over year and the reserve of billion design to respond to genuinely unexpected event that mean that we have inherit project overspend of billion that be billion hole in the public finance now not in the future but now it be billion of spending this year that be cover up by the conservative party if leave unaddresse it would mean increase in the budget deficit this year so today will set out the necessary and urgent work that have already do to reduce that pressure on the public finance by billion this year and over billion next year let be clear be not talk about cost for future year that the previous government sign up to but do not include like the compensation for infected blood which have cross party support be not talk about the state of public service in the future like the crisis in our prison that they have leave for we to fix be talk about the money that the previous government be already spend this year and have no ability to pay for which they hide from the country they have exhaust the reserve and they know that but nobody else do they duck the difficult decision put party before country and continue to make unfunded commitment after unfunded commitment know that the money be not there that have result in the position that we have now inherit the reserve be spend more than three time over only three month into the financial year and the previous government tell no one the scale of this overspend be not sustainable and to not act be simply not an option this month we have see official office for national statistics figure show that borrowing be high this year than the office for budget responsibility expect and the disaster of liz truss mini budget show what happen if we do not take tough decision to maintain economic stability some include the leader of the opposition and the shadow chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt have claim that the book be open how dare they it be not true and will tell the house why there be very clear instance of specific budget that be overspent and unfunded promise that be make but that crucially the obr be not aware of for its march forecast will take each in turn the first be the asylum system the forecast for the number of asylum seeker have rise dramatically since the last spending review and cost for asylum support have rise sevenfold in the past three year but instead of reflect those cost in the home office budget for this year the previous government cover up the true extent of the crisis and its spending implication the document be publish today reveal project overspend on the asylum system include the previous government fail rwanda plan of more than billion for this year alone that figure be unfunded and undisclosed next in the wake of the pandemic demand for rail service fall instead of develop proper plan to adjust to that new reality the government hand out cash to rail company to make up for passenger shortfall but fail to budget for this adequately because of that and because of industrial action there be now an overspend of billion in the transport budget that be unfunded and undisclosed since the government with the support of the whole house have rightly provide military assistance to ukraine in response to the russian invasion the spending audit find that there be not enough money set aside in the reserve to fund all these cost we will continue to honour these commitment in full and unlike the previous government we will make sure that they be always fully fund on top of these new pressure since inflation be above the bank of england target for month in row hit at its peak but the previous government have not hold spending review since which mean that they never fully reflect the impact of inflation in departmental budget that have direct impact on budget for public sector pay when the last spending review be conduct it be assume that pay award would be this year ordinarily the government be expect to give evidence to the pay review body on affordability but extraordinarily this year the previous government provide no guidance on what could or could not be afford to the pay review body that be almost unheard of but that be exactly what they do worse still the former education secretary have the pay review body recommendation sit on her desk instead of respond and deal with the consequence the government shirk the decision that need to be take will not repeat the previous government mistake where they provide no transparency to the public and no certainty for public service we will be open about the decision that be need and the step that we be take that begin with accept in full the recommendation of the independent pay review body the detail of these award be be publish today that be the right decision for the people who work in and most importantly the people who use our public service it give hard work staff the pay rise they deserve while ensure that we can recruit and retain the people we need it should not have take this long to come to these decision and do not want we to be in this position again so will consider option to reform the timetable for respond to the pay review body in the future this decision be in the good interest of our economy too the last government preside over the bad set of strike in generation which cause chaos and misery for the british public and wreak havoc on the public finance industrial action in the nhs alone cost the taxpayer billion last year that be why be pleased to announce today that the government have agree an offer to the junior doctor that the british medical association be recommend to its member my right hon friend the health secretary will set out further detail let pay tribute to he his leadership on the issue have pave the way to end dispute that have cause waiting list to spiral operation to be delay and agony for patient to be prolong today mark the start of new relationship between the government and staff work in our national health service and the whole country will welcome that where the previous government duck the difficult decision be take action know what they do about the state of the public finance they continue to make unfunded commitment after unfunded commitment that they know they could not afford put party before country and leave we with an overspend of billion this year where they preside over recklessness will bring responsibility will take immediate action let set it out in detail on pay have today set out our decision to meet the recommendation of the pay review body because the previous government fail to prepare for these recommendation in the departmental budget they come at an additional cost of billion this year the first difficult choice be make be to ask all department to find saving to absorb as much of this as possible total at least billion to support department as they do this will work with they to find saving ahead of the autumn budget include through measure to stop all non essential spending on consultancy and government communication be also take action to ask departments to find saving in their back office cost will now deal with series of commitment make by the previous government that they do not fund because if we can not afford it we can not do it first at the conservative party conference last year the former prime minister announce the introduction of new qualification the advanced british standard that be commitment cost nearly million next year rise to billion across future year this be suppose to be the former prime minister legacy but it turn out that he do not put aside single penny to pay for it so we will not go ahead with that policy because if we can not afford it we can not do it next the illegal migration act pass by the previous government make it impossible to process asylum application or remove people who have no right to be here instead they rely on doom policy to send asylum seeker to rwanda on plane that never take off leave ten of thousand of people stick in hotel on the public purse we need properly control and manage asylum system where rule be enforce so that those with no right to be here be swiftly remove so we have scrap their fail rwanda scheme which place huge pressure on the home office budget to bring down these cost as soon as possible my right hon friend the home secretary have already lay legislation to remove the retrospective element of the illegal migration act which will significantly reduce the use of hotel accommodation these measure will save nearly million this year and avoid cost spiral even far next year this be bad use of taxpayer money and we will not do it the previous government claim they be level up the country they make promise after promise to the british people but the spending audit have uncover that some of those commitment be not worth the paper that they be write on at autumn statement last year the former chancellor announce million for an investment opportunity fund but not single project have be support from that fund so follow discussion with my right hon friend the deputy prime minister be cancel it today because if we can not afford it we can not do it the previous government also make series of commitment on transport promise that people expect to be deliver and promise that many member across this house campaign on in good faith but the conservative party have fail they we have see from the national audit office the chaos that the previous government preside over with project over budget and delay again and again the spending audit have reveal billion of unfunded transport project that have be commit to next year so my right hon friend the transport secretary will undertake thorough review of these commitment as part of that work she have agree not to move forwards with project that the previous government refuse to publicly cancel despite know full well that they be unaffordable that include propose work on the and the and my right hon friend will also cancel the restore your railway programme save million next year with individual project to be assess through her review if we can not afford it we can not do it the previous government have plan for retail sale of natwest share we intend to fully exit our shareholding in natwest by but have consider advice have conclude that retail share sale offer would involve significant discount that could cost taxpayer hundred of million of pound it would therefore not represent value for money and it will not go ahead it be bad use of taxpayer money and we will not do it next let address the unfunded pressure in our nhs and our social care sector in october the government announce that new hospital would be build by since then only one new project have open to patient and only six have start their main construction activity the national audit office be clear that delivery be wildly off track but since come into office it have become clear that the previous government continue to maintain their commitment to hospital without anywhere close to the funding require to deliver they that give our constituent false hope we need to be straight with the british people about what be deliverable and what be affordable so we will conduct complete review of the new hospital programme with thorough realistic and costed timetable for delivery adult social care be also neglect by the previous government the sector need reform to improve care and to support staff in the previous parliament the government make costly commitment to introduce adult social care charge reform but they delay they two year ago because they know that local authority be not ready and that their promise be not fund so it will not be possible to take forward those charge reform this will save over billion by the end of next year outrageous order want government members to be quiet as well want to hear the chancellor of the exchequer can understand why people and member be angry be angry too the previous government let people down the previous government make commitment after commitment without know where the money be go to come from they do this repeatedly knowingly and deliberately today be call out the conservatives cover up and be take the first step to clean up what they have leave behind but the scale of the inheritance we have be leave mean that the decision we have so far announce will not be enough this level of overspend be not sustainable leave unchecked it be risk to economic stability and unlike the conservative party will never take risk with our country economic stability it therefore fall to we to take the difficult decision now to make further in year saving the scale of the situation we be deal with mean incredibly tough choice repeat today the commitment that we make in our manifesto to protect the triple lock but today be make the difficult decision that those not in receipt of pension credit or certain other means test benefit will no long receive the winter fuel payment from this year onwards the government will continue to provide winter fuel payment worth to household receive pension credit or to household in receipt of pension credit with someone over the age of let be clear this be not decision want to make nor be it the one that expect to make but these be the necessary and urgent decision that must make it be the responsible thing to do to fix the foundation of our economy and bring back economic stability alongside this change will work with my right hon friend the work and pensions secretary to maximise the take up of pension credit by bring forward the administration of housing benefit and pension credit repeatedly push back by the previous government and by work with old people charity and local authority to raise awareness of pension credit and help identify household not claim it this be the beginning of process not the end be announce today that will hold budget on october alongside full economic and fiscal forecast from the office for budget responsibility have to tell the house that the budget will involve take difficult decision to meet our fiscal rule across spending welfare and tax hon member ah mr speaker they still do get it do they party in downing street crash the economy gamble on the election party before country every single time it will be budget to fix the foundation of our economy and it will be budget build on the principle that this new government be elect on first we will treat taxpayer money with respect by ensure that every pound be well spend and we will interrogate every line of public spending to ensure that it represent value for money secondly can repeat from the dispatch box our manifesto commitment that we will not increase taxis on work people that mean that we will not increase national insurance the basic high or additional rate of income tax or vat today my hon friend the exchequer secretary be publish further detail on our manifesto commitment to close tax loophole and clamp down on tax avoidance to ensure that we bring in that money as quickly as possible my third principle be that we will meet our fiscal rule we will move the current budget into balance and we will get debt fall as share of the economy by the end of the forecast these be the principle that will guide at the budget but let be honest challenge trade off will remain so today be launch multi year spending review this review will set departmental budget for at least three year provide the long term certainty that have be lack for too long as part of that process final budget for this year and budget for next year will be set alongside the budget on october will look closely at our welfare system because if someone can work they should work that be principle of this government yet under the previous government welfare spending balloon while inactivity have rise sharply in recent year we will ensure that the welfare system be focus on support people into employment and we will assess the unacceptable level of fraud and error in our welfare system and take forward action to bring that down to fix the foundation of our economy we must ensure that never again can government keep from the public the true state of our public finance the fiscal framework have inherit have several flaw it allow the government to run down the clock on departmental budget to avoid difficult decision and to push they back beyond the election so be announce the most significant set of change to our framework since the inception of the office for budget responsibility these change will come into effect in the autumn first we have introduce legislation to ensure that we can never again see repeat of the mini budget secondly we will require the treasury to share with the office for budget responsibility its assessment of immediate public spending pressure and we will enshrine that rule in the charter for budget responsibility so that no government can ever again cover up the true state of our public finance finally we will ensure that never again do public service budget get set at only few month notice instead spending review will take place every two year with minimum planning horizon of three year to avoid uncertainty for departments and to boost stability for our public finance have already speak to the chair of the office for budget responsibility to brief he on the finding of our audit and our reform by launch the spending review be also today start the firing gun on new approach to public service reform to drive great productivity in the public sector we will embed an approach to government that be mission lead that be reform drive with great focus on prevention and the integration of service at national and local level and that be enable by new technology include through the work of my right hon friend the secretary of state for science innovation and technology on the opportunity of artificial intelligence to improve our public service we will establish new office of value for money with an immediate focus on identify area where we can reduce or stop spending or improve its value we will appoint covid corruption commissioner to bring back money that be owe to taxpayer after contract worth billion of pound be hand out by the previous government during the pandemic ahead of the spending review will also review the cost of our political system include restrict eligibility for ministerial severance payment base on time in office expect all level of government to be run effectively and efficiently and will work with leader across our country to deliver just that that mean effective local government civil service deliver good value for the british taxpayer and reform of our political institution include the house of lords to keep cost as low as possible the budget and spending review will also set out further progress on our no mission to grow our economy economic growth be the only way to sustainably improve our public service and our public finance so we will use the spending review to prioritise specific area of capital investment that leverage in billion more in private investment it will not happen overnight it will take time and it will take focus but we have already make significant progress include plan reform to get britain building national wealth fund to catalyse private investment pension investment review to unlock capital for our business skills england to create share national ambition to boost skill across our country and work across government on new industrial strategy drive forward by growth mission board to ensure that we deliver on our commitment our country have fundamental strength on which we can build and look forward to welcome business leader to the international investment summit in britain later this year know that if we can create the stable condition that investor need to thrive we will return confidence to our economy so that entrepreneur and business big and small know that this be the good place in the world to start and grow business that be the bedrock on which economic growth must be build the inheritance from the previous government be unforgiveable after the chaos of partygate when they know that trust in politic be at an all time low they give false hope to britain when people be already be hurt by their cost of living crisis they promise solution that they know could never be pay for road that would never be build public transport that would never arrive and hospital that would never treat single patient they spend like there be no tomorrow because they know that someone else would pick up the bill then in the election perhaps this be the most shocking part they campaign on platform to do it all over again with more unfunded tax cut and more spending pledge all the time know that they have no ability to pay for they no regard for the taxpayer no respect for ordinary hard work people will never do that will restore our country economic stability will make the tough choice will fix the foundation of our economy so that we can rebuild britain and make every part of our country well off commend this statement to the house call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer thank the chancellor for advance sight of her statement and echo her thought for the people and emergency service of southport today she will fool absolutely no one with shameless attempt to lay the ground for tax rise that she do not have the courage to tell we order want the cabinet to act like cabinet not like rabble that be try to shout at the shadow chancellor the chancellor say that the information be new but she tell the financial times you do need to win an election to find out the state of public finance as we ve get the obr now paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies have say the state of public finance be apparent pre election to anyone who care to look which be why he and other independent figure say that her argument be not credible and will not wash those public finance be audit by the obr just week before the election be call we be now expect to believe that in that short period billion black hole have magically emerge but for every single day in that period in fact since january in line with constitutional convention the right hon lady have privileged access to the treasury permanent secretary she could have find out absolutely anything she need will she confirm to the house that she do have meeting with the permanent secretary of the treasury before the election will she tell the house whether they discuss public finance will she tell the house whether they discuss any of the pressure that she be talk about today if so why be we only hear today what she want to do about they that be why today exercise be not economic it be political the chancellor want to blame the last conservative government for tax rise and project cancellation that she have be plan all along the trouble be even her own publish number expose the fiction behind today announcement just four day ago she present to the house the government estimate of spending plan for the year those estimate be legal requirement the official guidance manual be clear that department be responsible for ensure that estimate be consistent with their good forecast of requirement they be sign off by the most senior civil servant the accounting officer in every department yet four day on she be say that those estimate be wrong who be right politically neutral civil servant or political chancellor if she be right will she ask the cabinet secretary to investigate those civil servant and apologise to the house for lay mislead estimate of course not because she know that those civil servant be right and today black hole be spurious just like when she say that she inherit the bad set of economic circumstance since the second world war when bbc verify ask professor at the london school of economics about that claim he respond struggle to find metric that would make that statement correct the metric speak for themselves inflation be today nearly half what it be in when we have to clear up the mess inherit from labour government unemployment be nearly half what it be then with more new job than nearly anywhere else in europe so far this year we be the fast grow economy over the next six year the imf say that we will grow fast than france italy germany and japan just two day before the election be call the manage director of the imf praise the previous government handling of the economy and say it be in good place this week the institute for fiscal studies say that it be not bad situation to take charge of and certainly not comparable to the or if the right hon lady be in charge of the economy it be time to stop trash talk it what be the point of go to new york or brazil to bang the drum for more investment if she come home with cock and bull story about how bad everything be she should stop play politic with britain reputation and get on with run the economy when it come to public finance will the chancellor confirm to the house that far from be broke and break as downing street brief the medium the forecast deficit today be compare with when labour leave office in in other word when labour be last in office we be borrow double the current level will she confirm another difference between today and the conservatives come to office then honest about our plan and say straightforwardly that we need to cut the deficit she have just win an election tell we repeatedly that taxis will not go up how many seat be win on the back of commitment not to raise tax while she be quietly plan to do the exact opposite on the detail that the chancellor have announce today will she confirm that around half of today fictitious black hole come from discretionary public sector pay award in other word not something that she have to do but something where she have choice will she confirm to the house that apart from the teacher recommendation none of the other pay review body recommendation be see by the last government as they arrive after the election be call today she have choose to accept those recommendation but before do so be she advise by official to ask union for productivity enhancement before accept above inflation pay award to help to pay for those award as the last government do if she be advise to do that why do she reject that advice and simply tell the union here your money thank for your support will she know labour members do not like the truth but here it be will she confirm that one of the reason for her funding gap be that she have choose to backdate pay award to junior doctor to cover the time when they be strike we be just three month into the financial year so why do the chancellor not mention today that at the start of the year the treasury have reserve of billion for unexpected revenue cost and billion for unexpected capital cost additionally why have she not account for the treasury ability to manage down in year pressure on the reserve last year alone by billion why have she apparently not account for underspend typically billion year have she totally abandon the billion of welfare saving plan by the last government if so will she confirm that to the house have she also abandon billion of annual productivity saving plan by the last government if not why be they not in her number finally for someone who claim continuously the mantle of fiscal rectitude will she confirm that in order to pay for her public spending plan she will not change her fiscal rule to target different debt measure so she can increase borrowing and debt by the back door every chancellor face pressure on public finance after pandemic and an energy crisis those pressure be particularly challenging which be why in autumn the previous government take painful but necessary decision on tax and spend but we know that if we continue to take difficult decision on pay productivity and welfare reform we could live within our mean and start to bring taxis down she on the other hand know perfectly well that labour government would duck those difficult decision she have cave in to the union on pay leave welfare reform out of the king speech and soft pedalled on our productivity programme that be choice not necessity that choice mean that taxis will have to go up and the right hon lady choose not to tell we before the election instead in day just day she have announce billion for gb energy billion for the national wealth fund and around billion for public sector pay award that be billion in day around billion for every day she have be in office leave taxpayer to pick up the tab for her profligacy do it this way she make the first major misstep of her time as chancellor because that great office of state depend more than any on in her first big moment she break that trust with an utterly bogus attempt to hoodwink the public about the choice she have over time in the election labour tell we it have no plan to raise taxis now in turn that will forever shame this labour government she be lay the ground to break her word when she do her first budget will become the big betrayal in history by new chancellor work family will never forgive she the shadow chancellor have an opportunity this afternoon to admit what he have do the legacy he have leave instead he take no responsibility the word the country be look for today be sorry he could not find those word no wonder the conservative party so definitively lose the trust of the british people at the election three and half week ago we say never again interruption never again should party that play fast and loose with the public finance be in charge of the public order can just say to the whips who hold responsible job and expect they to keep they that way that just because they might not be at the end of the bench do not mean they have to chunter all the way through and pass comment do need it and will put up with it first specifically on the black hole we could not have know these number because the conservative party do not tell the obr these number that be why we be in the position we be in today that be the big scandal of they all the shadow chancellor ask about the estimate he should recognise the estimate we lay yesterday because he produce they we have to lay those estimate to allow public spending to continue but since those estimate be produce information be give to we by treasury official about the true scale of the overspending by the conservative party the shadow chancellor mention the ifs paul johnson from the ifs have just say that it appear that these overspend be genuinely unfunded word not from but from the independent ifs which the shadow chancellor reference the shadow chancellor mention what happen to the reserve well the reserve have be spend shadow chancellor it be spend by you three time over that be why we be in position of billion in year gap between spending that be happen and the funding to produce it if the shadow chancellor could do all the thing he speak about today why be they not in the forecast if he be able as he say to make those in year change on welfare and productivity they would have be in the forecast they be not on the issue of the pay review body the previous government set the remit for those but they refuse to give they any indication of affordability that be almost unprecedented the teacher report before the election and that recommendation sit on the former education secretary desk today we be draw line on the industrial action the billion cost to the nhs alone last year and million cancel appointment we be incorporate third of those pay increase into efficiency in our public service as the shadow chancellor suggest we should when it come to tax be not go to take any lesson from the conservative party the conservative party take the tax burden to the high level in year the response of the shadow chancellor just confirm what we already know the previous government be delude out of touch and grossly irresponsible today we begin to fix the mess that they have create in we repeatedly hear the word the labour government do not fix the roof while the sun be shin be it not the case that the last government not only do not fix the roof but destroy the entire foundation of our public service in the context of difficult decision welcome two point make by my right hon friend first there be the encouragement to work with local council to increase the take up of pension credit the levelling up housing and communities committee call for that repeatedly in the last parliament but it be not take up secondly can the chancellor confirm that she intend to provide multi year settlement ultimately for local council which again have call for that repeatedly it would be welcome step to help they with the very difficult financial situation that they be face can confirm that we will be arrange multi year settlement with local authority as well as with departments it be extremely important that both departments and authority can plan for the future know what money be available rather than run down the clock towards the end of the year thank my hon friend for welcome the announcement that make today about work with local government to improve the take up of pension credit it be woeful that it be so low it be vital that everyone receive the money to which they be entitle especially pensioner which be why we have take on those recommendation from elderly people charity today to ensure that we work with local government to boost take up of that benefit call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the chancellor for advance sight of her statement let associate myself with the expression of gratitude to our emergency service the thought of all liberal democrats be with those affect by the incident in southport year of conservative chaos and mismanagement have leave our economy on life support and in desperate need of emergency care thing can not go on like this any long we must now revive growth by get people off nhs waiting list and back into work so we urge the government to invest wisely in gps dentist and hospital not only to support patient but to improve efficiency in the nhs and deliver the growth that be so desperately need after year of conservative failure the outgoing conservative government will go down in the history book as one of the most damaging administration that our country have see and today statement have throw that picture into even starker relief it be not just their catastrophic mini budget we see vicious cycle of stagnation and recession drive by year of chaos and uncertainty for the first time living standard decline over the course of parliament as people experience the harsh cost of live crisis in generation our public service be abandon waiting list soar school crumble and our social care be in crisis the dire state in which the conservatives leave our public finance be indicative of their irresponsibility people be painfully aware that conservative chaos have real life consequence interest rate be send soar and million of people see their mortgage payment increase by hundred of pound month that be why more than ever we need to foster economic stability to draw line under the uncertainty of the last few year an important step in rebuild confidence in our economy be the setting up of long term industrial strategy that will help to unlock vital investment create good job and help we to tackle the climate emergency will the chancellor reassure the house that the government will start work on such strategy as soon as practically possible we can not talk about rebuild our economy without talk about the crisis in health and social care million have long term health condition that make they too ill to work and million more be stick on nhs waiting list many other can not leave hospital because there be no care provision the liberal democrats have always understand that we can not have thriving economy and strong public finance until we fix the crisis in health and social care which be why we put forward detailed proposal to deliver more gps invest in dental service and cut ambulance waiting time equally we must give people the good quality care that they deserve so we urge the government to work across party line to implement system of free personal care and give our unpaid carer the proper support that they need the last conservative administration leave people with crippling care cost that be why it be urgent for we to have cross party talk on social care and urge the government to begin those as soon as they possibly can invest in health and care be not just about give people the fair deal that they deserve it be also about sound management of our public finance will the chancellor guarantee that the nhs and social care will be at the heart of her plan to address the conservative party legacy of mismanagement part of that legacy be the previous government promise to deliver new hospital which be postpone redefine and never properly fund it turn out to be yet another empty conservative promise but have listen to many colleague on these benches over the last few year some hospital be clearly in dire need of investment with crumble roof and bucket to catch the leak will the chancellor meet member whose constituent will be affect by today announcement to hear directly about the situation in their hospital lastly let turn to the other side of the equation secure the funding that our public service so desperately need over the last parliament we see the conservative party raise taxis on hard work household again and again just to pay for its own mistake do the chancellor agree that it would be unfair to ask work people to pick up the tab second time after they have already suffer through year of painful tax rise my party have set out detailed proposal to raise funding for our public service in fair way for example by reverse the conservatives tax cut for big bank put in place proper windfall tax on oil and gas producer and raise the digital service tax on social medium giant urge the chancellor to draw from these idea which could raise billion of pound by ask some of the large company in the world to pay their fair share there be no doubt that our economy our public service and our public finance have be leave in precarious position now the hard work must be do to repair the damage and return stability growth and prosperity to our country that be what the liberal democrats will always champion and we sincerely hope that the government will look closely at our proposal to end the crisis in health and social care grow our economy and give people fair deal thank the hon lady for her contribution particularly the theme about help people into work and fix our national health service totally agree with she about the immense damage that the tory mini budget do particularly in push up mortgage cost for so many of our constituent the hon lady ask about industrial strategy my right hon friend the business and trade secretary will be set out more detail of the modern industrial strategy which will enable we to work in partnership with business to exploit the big opportunity that the country and the economy have for growth and prosperity in all part of the uk the hon lady ask about health and social care she be absolutely right to highlight the huge challenge of the waiting list it be at million when the conservatives leave office welcome the deal to get junior doctor back to work and be sure the whole country will because it will mean that people can get operation and treatment when they need after last year industrial action cost our economy billion and cause million appointment to be miss the deal will be welcome by people on nhs waiting list of course this government have make commitment to provide additional appointment every single week that be why we will crack down on tax avoidance and ensure that finally non dom who make their home in britain pay their fair share of tax here my right hon friend the health secretary will meet constituent who be affect by the previous government betrayal on build new hospital because we recognise as the hon lady say the importance of ensure that all our constituent have the health service they deserve could not agree more with she that it should not be work people who pick up the tab for the conservative party failure that be why have restate our commitment not to increase taxis on work people there will be no increase in income tax national insurance or vat that be the commitment on which we campaign in this election and stand by that commitment congratulate my right hon friend and the labour government on make such strong start and particularly on the emphasis on transparency and accountability for the hard earn money of our tax pay constituent she say that the treasury will be ask to share with the office for budget responsibility its assessment of immediate public spending pressure and that she want to enshrine that rule in the charter for budget responsibility will she also make sure that that be public document that be report to parliament to maintain this vital transparency go forward thank my hon friend for her question she speak from her experience as chair of the public accounts committee and agree with she entirely the charter for budget responsibility will be publish we have already introduce legislation for the new fiscal lock that we set out in our manifesto so that we can ensure that government can never again do what the previous government do which be to overspend by billion within one year what chilling political choice to choose to take away the winter fuel allowance from year old on an income of year and that be political choice want to ask the chancellor more about productivity she use the word once during her speech what discussion have she have about improve productivity which accord to the office for budget responsibility be still low in the public sector and have not recover since the level we enjoy before the pandemic the challenge of productivity sit across both the public and private sector in the last year productivity have flatline in the public and private sector and we need to boost both we need to boost productivity in the public sector to ensure that we get well value for money for our public service but we also need to improve productivity in our private sector so that we can improve living standard and have the money for our public service welcome the chancellor statement about public sector pay but be it not clear that after savage public service hold down public sector pay and drive million people into food bank this crazy ideological austerity programme of the tories have fail massively while at the same time the rich people in the country gain wealth of billion can tempt the chancellor to say that while we accept that there be hard decision to make we reject the ideological commitment to this form of tory austerity thank my hon friend for that question we do owe it to our armed force our prison officer our police officer our nurse and our teacher to reward they properly for their work and that be what we do today in implement in full the recommendation of the pay review body echo his view that return to austerity would be no way to run our economy it result in growth haemorrhaging in the last parliament with all the damage that that do to living standard and to the money for our public service the chancellor be like dodgy car mechanic she say she have do all the search she give you fix price you hand in your car key and then few week later she have find all these new problem the price have double but it be too late you have give she your car and you both know that this be her plan all along trust and credibility be critical to chancellor why have she be so careless and so quick to throw hers away if the right hon gentleman have any chance of fix the mess that his previous government make he might want to start with an apology thank the chancellor for her honesty on the incredibly serious situation that she have just outline do she agree that the above inflation pay deal agree by this government with our public sector staff will begin the process of rebuild trust between they and our government and will benefit the public purse by reduce strike action thank my hon friend for that question let we just be clear that the pay recommendation today be in line with private sector pay these be just the pay deal that be receive by the majority of worker in the private sector my hon friend be right that we owe debt of gratitude to our frontline worker who get we through the pandemic and so many other challenge over the last few year and they deserve to be pay properly for their work during the recent election campaign we in the snp repeatedly warn about an billion hole in the labour party spending plan now that the chancellor have confirm that today will she apologise to those voter in scotland who support the labour party leader in scotland when he say read my lip no austerity will she also reverse the cut in scotland capital allocation please be not sure if hon gentleman be pay attention the billion black hole be this year the institute for fiscal studies be warn about black hole of billion over the lifetime of the parliament those be two very different thing and both of they can be true what we be show today be an in year gap of billion that the hon gentleman do not know about that no one on this side of the house know about that the obr do not know about and that the country do not know about this be new information that be be publish today above and beyond what anyone know when we be campaign in the election frankly the conservatives response leave something to be desire after year of strip the engine of this country economy their response be simply take the piston be so proud that we now have chancellor who be not penny wise and pound foolish but be conscious that all our constituent will have to pick up the piece after the past year can the chancellor tell we little more about her audit and what it have identify about the money waste by the previous government and their mismanagement of capital project we now know for example that the failure to rebuild whipps cross hospital have cost we an extra million in the last few year alone our constituent will pay the price of the last government for many year to come this new labour government need to be honest with they sorry seem to be the hard word for the conservatives to say but can the chancellor tell we just how much money it will cost this country be owe billion apology by the conservative party and my hon friend be right to highlight the overspend include on the hospital programme there be billion gap between what be announce and what be need for those hospital there be also billion overspend on the asylum system that be all unfunded and undisclosed until disclose it today welcome the affirmation of the funding for ukraine which presume be already fully allocate from the treasury reserve in the usual way on the mainstream defence budget the chancellor have announce that all departmental spending will now be review every two year give the speed at which whitehall work this mean that the minute one review be finish work will start on the next all public spending particularly capital spending will effectively be under permanent review this will not work how can we commit to year defence programme such as the vital new tempest fighter if all departmental budget be up in the air every two year first there be billion reserve for departmental expenditure and it be spend three time over before arrive in the treasury that be why we face these problem today secondly yes we fully intend to set long term budget for capital expenditure but we will have three year spending review every two year for day to day departmental expenditure which be really important for give certainty so that government departments can plan for the future today no department or local authority know its budget beyond next march that be no position to put departments in include the ministry of defence welcome my right hon friend statement and particularly what she say about the public sector pay award could she share little more about how give the appalling economic condition that we now face she will incorporate equity in her decision on how to address the in year deficit have to be honest that the decision have make today be tough decision they be not the decision that want to make or that expect to make give the seriousness of the inheritance that face they be the right decision the responsible decision and the fair decision that could make in the circumstance the legacy of the conservatives new hospital programme be dire but the chancellor will know that there be also cost to delay we have life expire building that will continue to need to be patch up until they be replace so urge the chancellor as urge the secretary of state for health and social care last week to give the go ahead to those project that be ready to go and involve life expire building will she review the outdated rule and allow hospital to spend more

conservative party use to work in the treasury what we have hear today about the conservative party be shocking and shameful the chancellor have set out how far away the last government be from meet

expertise everything in our manifesto be fully cost and fully fund include additional nhs appointment every single week which will be fund by crack down on tax avoidance and ensure that people who

people should contribute to the public purse under labour they will call sir julian lewis congratulation on your election madam deputy speaker can not hope to match the splendid double entendre of the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy but may say to the chancellor that one effect of be here for long time be realisation that no one party have monopoly on wisdom give the impartial assessment by the library that covid cost this country between billion and billion be she willing to at least concede that the previous government do pretty good job in get inflation down to less than two year after the pandemic the pandemic be no excuse for make unfunded spending commitment which be precisely what the previous government do the right hon gentleman mention the pandemic during which the government hand out contract to friend and donor to their party put they in vip lane that be why we be appoint covid corruption commissioner we want that money back in our public service where it belong call bill esterson welcome to your place madam deputy speaker it be not just the public finance that the conservatives mismanage over year they fail to support industry too figure publish today

place to start and grow business and the good place to invest we look forward to hold our international investment summit in the uk later this year have sympathy for the chancellor seek to address the issue that she have outline but the solution that she have set out today be focus on spending cut will she please say more about the opportunity that she be look at for bring revenue into the exchequer so that we can have the investment that be need whether in new hospital we all know that hospital around the country be crumble or in the railway as people be stick in traffic jam and struggle with high rail fare in particular have she consider introduce wealth tax tax on the very wealthy in society people with asset of more than million would raise ten of billion of pound during this parliament and it could address the fact that we have grow billionaire wealth while ordinary people be suffer from these cut thank the hon gentleman for that question have just set out the non dom tax loophole closure and my hon friend the exchequer secretary have publish write ministerial statement today set out our manifesto commitment around the energy profit levy vat on private school

effect may thank my right hon friend for her transparency and openness about the dire state of our inheritance from the conservatives the tory leadership race be now clearly in full swing which be important people across the filton and bradley stoke constituency and across the country deserve to know why none of the contender come clean about this black hole when they be in government or be they keep in the dark by the chancellor predecessor as well far be it from to give advice to tory leadership contestant but if be take part in this contest would want to distance myself as much as possible from the government in the previous parliament who cause this terrible mess the chancellor commit to long term planning for capital expenditure last march the then chancellor commit billion to carbon capture usage and storage without which net zero future can not be deliver in the light of the right hon lady review can she set out for the house what commitment this government will make

well as green hydrogen and renewable ready port we will set out all our spending in the spending review later this year congratulation on your appointment madam deputy speaker it feel really good to be back on the government benches the annual account of the department of health and social care show that billion spend on personal protective equipment be write off do the chancellor agree that we could claw back this money through the covid corruption commissioner and then possibly use some of it to eradicate child poverty thank my hon friend for that question it be to the previous government huge shame that they spend billion of pound of taxpayer money on vip lane contract and on ppe that be never use in some case it have literally go up in smoke and be burn we be appoint covid corruption commissioner because that money belong not in the pocket of tory donor but in our public service and we will do everything within our power to get their money back last week the secretary of state for health and social care say hospital with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be at the top of my list of priority official report july vol if the new hospital programme be delay via review so will be the rebuilding of the five raac hospital that be not among the reference without avoid the question with soundbite what reassurance can the chancellor give that we will break ground on any of the new raac replacement hospital and specifically hinchingbrooke hospital in my constituency of huntington during this parliament the hon gentleman should blame the previous government for not fund the commitment that they make my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care will meet all the people affect include those affect by hospital with raac problem as soon as possible as leeds mp recognise the importance of new hospital and ensure that our hospital estate be fit for purpose but we can not spend money that we do not have the shadow chancellor say the book be open and that the office for budget responsibility have audit the government figure shortly before the election however the chair of the obr have today publish letter confirm he intend to launch review into the preparation of the march forecast state we be make aware of the extent of these pressure at meeting with the treasury last week be only new here perhaps the chancellor can inform how to get the shadow chancellor to correct the record the obr have just publish letter as my hon friend say which state we be make aware of the extent of these pressure at meeting with the treasury last week and go on to state if significant fraction of these pressure be ultimately accommodate through high del spending in this would constitute one of the large year ahead overspend against del forecast outside of the pandemic year this be incredibly serious that be why come to this house today to set out that billion overspend compare with what the government set out at the previous budget this letter from the chair of the office for budget responsibility can leave no one in this chamber in any doubt about the seriousness of the situation thank the chancellor for her candour and her clarity today there will be many resident and patient at frimley park hospital in my constituency surround by forest of acrow prop hold up raac riddled roof who will be deeply anxious at her announcement can she recommit to the health secretary commitment last week to prioritise spending where possible on those raac affect hospital and bring some comfort and clarity to the patient and the staff of frimley park hospital fully understand the hon gentleman concern know that during the election campaign like so many member across the house he will have campaign in good faith believe that the money be there can say in all candour today that the money be not there for this hospital programme although it be not my apology to make apologise on behalf of the conservatives for the state of the public finance that they have leave for we to sort out my right hon friend the health secretary will meet the hon gentleman and everyone affect so that we can do whatever we can to make sure that we can get hospital in the condition that his constituent and so many of our constituent rightly expect will the chancellor confirm that despite the conservatives failure to set aside money for transport commitment labour plan to modernise the network vital for my community in east thanet will deliver unified rail system that mean we can deliver more for passenger and local community we have have to make difficult decision today to cancel road and rail infrastructure project these be not decision we want to make but if the money be not there we can not go ahead with those project it be as simple as that the money have to be there and the sum always have to add up because will not make the mistake of the previous government and liz truss crash the economy and send interest rate and mortgage rate spiral for our constituent that be why have have to take these action today to get grip on public spending and public finance make no apology for that but recognise the damage it do to so many constituent with project that they have expect to see happen when the chancellor legislation enable illegal entrant to leave their current accommodation where will they go under the previous government no application be be process and so nobody be be send home we will process those application and send people who have no right to be here back home thank my right hon friend the chancellor for her excellent statement put public finance and public service back on their foot have see how extensive this tory cover up have be with unfunded commitment in multiple department do she agree that it be not just her predecessor as chancellor but every member of the last cabinet who be complicit in that cover up do not believe that any member of the previous cabinet could not have be aware of the scale of this cover up and the scale of the overspending they should hang their head in shame instead of come to this chamber today and issue platitude they should have do the right thing and apologise to the country the chancellor have make two key political decision this afternoon one to fund extraordinarily high public sector pay increase and two to clobber pensioner to pay for it will she explain to the house and every pensioner who will lose their winter fuel allowance in the process why she do not challenge the bank of england on the taxpayer bailout that it require to the tune of ten of billion of pound to cover its loss from bond sale first it be an extraordinary omission that the previous government do not set affordability criterion for the independent pay review body which mean that they be able to come back with these recommendation it would be almost without precedent not to accept recommendation from an independent pay review body if the hon gentleman want to go to the doctor nurse teacher police officer and those in the armed force in his constituency and say that they do not deserve pay increase in line with private sector wage that be up to he but believe that those public sector worker deserve those pay increase on pension and the winter fuel payment this be not the decision want to make and it be not the decision expect to make but we have to make in year saving which be incredibly difficult to do without do that we would put our public finance at risk we be ensure that everybody who be entitle to pension credit the poor pensioner continue to get the winter fuel payment and we will work with the department for work and pensions local authority and charity to boost the take up of pension credit call rachael maskell thank you madam deputy speaker and welcome to your place thank my right hon friend for her forensic approach to the nation finance as she dig deeply she will see that york the city represent be at the bottom of many of the matrix for the funding formula will she look at the funding formula before the budget so that we can see the distribution of funding the last government hand out for pet project much of the money that she be try to get control of now but will she look at how that be distribute across the country know particularly around flood defence that there be many great need in the york constituency that my hon friend represent these decision will all be make at the time of the spending review resident of eastbourne will be outraged to learn that the conservatives promise of brand new hospital for our town be not worth the paper it be write on eastbourne deserve well under investment have consequence and at the moment eastbourne district general hospital be close for birth due to that under investment and it have be since december it need investment will the chancellor confirm that her government will invest in midwife doctor and nurse as well as hospital building to protect local service there and across the country can see on behalf of the hon gentleman constituent the frustration and anger that he feel at the previous government let his constituent down so badly by not fund the hospital that they promise commit to my right hon friend the health secretary meeting everybody affect we also have workforce plan to invest in the future workforce in our national health service and we be announce today that we be accept in full the recommendation of the independent pay review body to pay properly our doctor nurse and other who work in our nhs call torsten bell congratulation on your new post madam deputy speaker there can be reasonable political debate across the house about the total level of public spending there be lot of that during the election campaign with our call for high level of public investment but there should be complete agreement about the need for the treasury to ensure that public money be well spend at the top of that be make sure that the policy and commitment of every department match their budget we hear from expert right around the country today that they do not match those budget so can the chancellor reassure this ex treasury official this house and my swansea constituent that this will never happen under this labour government thank my hon friend for that question and welcome he to his place in this house he speak powerfully base on his previous experience will fix the mess that we have inherit but it be terrible mess billion in year gap between what be forecast to be spend and what be actually be spend by the previous government we will get grip on our public finance that require tough choice but that be the role of chancellor and it be the role of government these be choice that the previous government duck and divert but we will make the difficult decision to get our public finance back on firm footing we could do with some masterclasse in short question and short answer early the chancellor quote paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies but she omit the end of his comment he say that half of the spending hole she claim be public sector pay over which govt make choice that be the truth be it not the chancellor do good shocked face but she choose to create her own spending hole do she not it be the previous government who set the mandate for the pay review body it be extraordinary that they do not include in that remit measure of affordability but they do not which be why the pay review body make these recommendation the previous education secretary could have reject those recommendation but she let they sit on her desk because the previous government be not willing to make tough decision we have make those decision include make sure that third of the cost of these pay award be absorb but there be cost to inaction last year there be billion cost to the nhs alone because of industrial action under the previous government there be at least billion black hole in defence and of course they have hollow out the armed force however it be surprise to find out today that not enough money be set aside in reserve to fund all the military assistance need for ukraine would the chancellor say bit more about that the problem that the previous government get into be that every time they want to make commitment they say it would be pay for from the reserve by the time come into the treasury on july that reserve have be spend three time over because they put so many commitment into that reserve that they could not afford that be the situation that we inherit that be where the billion black hole come from and that be why be have to make difficult decision today to get grip on the public finance the chancellor spend the election campaign say that she be go for growth through invest in infrastructure instead she be cut it while fund inflation bust pay deal and scrap pension benefit for the worst off do she agree that in the battle for the two face of the labour party the face of tax rise borrowing and boom and bust win and the british people hard work people will ultimately lose under her leadership there be nothing pro growth about make unfunded spending commitment there be nothing pro growth about lack of respect for taxpayer money we will continue to provide the winter fuel payment for the poor pensioner those in receipt of pension credit thank the chancellor for her statement today and for be straight with the public about the state of our finance know my constituent want government who tell it to they straight do she agree that duck tough decision and hide bad news as the conservative party have do just make bad situation even bad the previous government and the previous chancellor should hang their head in shame for the inheritance they have leave for this government to fix but will fix this mess will put our public finance and our public spending on firm footing that be the responsible thing to do and that be what will do welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker everybody and their granny know that there would be multi billion pound black hole only the chancellor seem to be deaf and blind to the situation we know that she would be here explain the sheer scale of it yet when we raise this issue during the election campaign we be tell that we be be misleading and that it be all mince well we know now do cut winter fuel payment to all pensioner not seem and feel like tory austerity what discussion have the chancellor have with the scottish government because as she will know this be devolved responsibility my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury brief the scottish government today on these decision these decision be necessary it be not in the interest of the scottish people to have unfunded commitment and to put our public finance and reputation for economic stability at risk these be not easy decision they be difficult decision but the fault for they lie with the previous government the hon gentleman claim that what have announce today be austerity when we have just give pay rise to more than million public sector worker he do not know what he be talk about thank my right hon friend for her clarity and candour after year of sluggish growth and low living standard and then cost of living crisis how callous be it that the tories go into the election ask for another five year in power with manifesto of false hope undeliverable promise and no mention of the numerous black hole that she have now uncover what will she do instead to offer my constituent some real hope thank my hon friend for that question be pleased to have she as constituency neighbour in leeds she be absolutely right that the previous government go into the election know that there be billion black hole what do they do during that election they make more unfunded spending commitment and more unfunded promise about tax that they know they could not keep that be deeply irresponsible after all the damage that they have do they should have come to the chamber today and apologise would the chancellor confirm that all the information present today be not know to she before last thursday when the estimate be lay when arrive at the treasury three week ago ask treasury official to do full analysis we conclude that analysis over the weekend and be publish it today for the house of commons thank the chancellor for the urgent update with living standard now bad than when the previous government take office people across the country continue to suffer the consequence of their broken promise and mismanagement but this final fiscal mic drop be truly shocking do she agree that in contrast to the unfunded fantasy promise put forward by the conservative party labour manifesto show cast iron discipline in be fully cost thank my hon friend for the question everything in labour manifesto be fully cost and fully fund we now know that on top of the billion black hole that the previous government leave they make unfunded commitment during the election that be deeply irresponsible and the country be right to reject they do the chancellor think that one of her first decision to cancel infrastructure project be consistent with her desire to grow the economy there be nothing pro growth about make commitment that we can not afford there be nothing pro growth about have billion of unfunded commitment we see that when liz truss do her mini budget less than two year ago and right hon and hon opposition members would do well to learn that lesson call clive lewis welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker my right hon friend the chancellor will probably not be too surprised to hear that when it come to wasteful and expensive vanity project the conservative party have not confine itself to national matter conservative run norfolk county council be attempt to push through million vanity road know as the norwich western link which measure km at cost of more than million kilometre will she look at that environmental and financial disaster and work with those of we who know that there be more cost effective and ecologically sound alternative thank my hon friend for raise this issue will ask my right hon friend the transport secretary to meet he and discuss it far be grateful for the chancellor clarity on the state of the public finance and for confirm that the government will accept the recommendation of the independent pay review body she explain that do so incur an additional in year cost of billion and that departments will be task with find saving of up to billion can she outline whether she anticipate that they will have to cover the entire cost of the pay review body recommendation or do she anticipate that the treasury will need to make additional fund available to make up the shortfall thank the hon gentleman for the question we have ask departments to absorb billion of the pressure but it will be different in different department we know that in the department of health and social care and the department for education for example it will be hard to absorb those pay pressure give the huge challenge that they face it will be different in different department as we will set out in write ministerial statement by the relevant secretaries of state thank my right hon friend the chancellor for come to this house and outline the difficult decision she have have to take on behalf of we all decision that she would not have have to take be it not for the opaque fiscal negligence of the conservative party can she reassure that labour government will always protect the vulnerable and that under labour government pensioner in this country will still be over well off per year by the end of this parliament thank my hon friend for that question we be determined to protect the most vulnerable which be why we make the decision to ensure that the winter fuel payment would still be pay to the poor pensioner on pension credit more than that we will work with local government and charity to increase the take up of pension credit so that everybody who deserve pension credit get it and with it the winter fuel payment we all remember gordon brown raid on pension it have take just three week for labour to revert to type and it be pensioner who be suffer most martin lewis have already criticise the decision online on the estimate the right hon lady can not claim that when permanent secretary be sign off these estimate over the weekend assume they do not know about these suppose hole but if that be so and they do sign they off with hole in they that would be breach of their legal duty so will she be investigate they or will she be apologise to they for throw they under the bus today instead of blame civil servant the hon lady should blame the people who be really responsible and that be the previous government the country do the right thing by kick they out three week ago they deserve never to get their hand on power again during the last parliament the government pay substantial amount to the train operate company to make good their loss during prolong period of industrial dispute cause mayhem and cause chaos to the general public at the same time the train operate company pay huge dividend and they also pay their executive massive increase in bonus can my right hon friend say how much this actually cost the british taxpayer and can she ensure that this never ever happen again yes page of the fix the foundation document that we have publish today set out the pressure on public spending on rail service pressure have emerge on rail finance primarily due to the weak than expect recovery in passenger demand as well as the cost of industrial action have lead to pressure of billion in this financial year alone call christine jardine would also like to welcome you to the chair madame deputy speaker much of what the chancellor say welcome no fresh income tax national insurance or vat but be sure the chancellor will recognise the concern that many pensioner particularly in the cold area of the country will be feel at the announcement of the withdrawal of winter fuel payment although she be say that she will work on bring more people forward and encourage they to sign up for credit can she tell we how she be go to do that if she be also go to cut the government communication budget think the hon lady for that question there be couple of thing we be commit to do first pension credit and housing benefit be due to be amalgamate the previous government put that back we will bring that forward we know that take up of pension credit will increase when it be merge with housing benefit that will make an impact in ensure that people get the money they be entitle to however we have also commit as elderly people charity have ask to central government work with local government to well identify people who be entitle to pension credit but be not claim it today we want to make sure that everyone who be entitle to pension credit get it and with it the associate winter fuel payment do my right hon friend agree that one of the key failure of the conservative government over the past year be their failure to grow the economy and that that lack of growth mean they simply do not have the money to do the thing that they none the less committed to voter in this country to do that be why we should take no lesson on trust and credibility from the conservative party if our economy have grow at just the average rate for oecd economy over the past year it would today be worth billion more that would have be worth for every family in britain and would have mean an additional billion for our public service without increase tax by single penny that show how important economic growth be which be why get our economy grow be the no mission of this government call david simmonds thank you and welcome to your place madam deputy speaker the estimate day provision present by the chancellor to the house last week include capital departmental expenditure limit of billion for the department of health and social care we know that it include the fund for the new hillingdon hospital which be grant planning permission and where work have already start do the chancellor of the exchequer stand by what she tell the house in the estimate day debate on which we all rely when cast our vote can she therefore assure my constituent that that hospital project which be fully budget for and where work have already start will be deliver by this government as the hon gentleman know estimate have to be publish to ensure that government funding continue so we have to publish those main estimate but we will be present new estimate to the house base on the revelation that we have set out today can express the anger that many of my constituent will be feel not just about the economic mismanagement and the litany of broken promise from the conservative party but about the complete failure to be transparent both with they and with the british public at large what do the chancellor have to say to the conservative party about the way it behave in office we have now be in the chamber for one hour and minute but we have not have single apology from any opposition members they should have come to the chamber today and apologise they have not do so the country kick they out of office three and half week ago and we can tell why may point out to certain opposition members who might question the difficult decision that the chancellor have take to restrict the winter fuel payment to those on pension credit that this approach have be put forward by the conservatives and the lib dems in recent manifesto the scottish government own anti poverty advisory body have state that as it stand this particular instrument be extraordinarily poorly target as regard address poverty do the chancellor agree that although it be difficult this decision be sensible step towards fix the huge tory black hole in our public finance none of the decision that we have make today be easy none of they be decision that want to have to make but leave unaddresse billion in year hole in our public finance be not an option we see what happen when previous prime minister and chancellor play fast and loose with the public finance will not do that which be why today have be

where the responsibility lie for these failure and for the difficult announcement that have have to make today cash strap council be project to spend billion to support child with special educational need and disability by that be up from billion decade ago do the chancellor agree that the tories failure to get to grip with the sen crisis have put public finance at risk while let sen child down

set out all our spending plan and priority at the spending review later this year welcome the chancellor of the exchequer and her team to their place be concerned that have not see anything in the chancellor statement or the accompany report on the woman who suffer maladministration of their pension the parliamentary and health service ombudsman which we all utilise when do constituency

waspi woman today that she will not do it my right hon friend the work and pensions secretary be consider that report as we speak for my constituent this mess go beyond money it be about trust in politic do the chancellor agree that the damage go even deep than the harm to our economy that she have set out my hon friend be absolutely right today revelation of billion in year overspend come on

state of the public finance and the action that will take to sort out this mess congratulation on your recent election madam deputy speaker my training as veterinary surgeon and my work in public health programme around the world have teach that it be always more cost effective to keep people healthy rather than treat they when they get sick our hospital in winchester be good example as of people in the department be there because they can not get gp appointment people be there with tooth abscess because they can not get dentist appointment and be there with mental health crisis and often be already on waiting list do the chancellor agree that when finance be so stretch there must not be the temptation to view primary care as cost to be cut because investment in dentist doctor public health and mental health will make the nhs more efficient and that will be well for patient and the taxpayer in the long run the hon gentleman be absolutely right the spending review will focus on both integration and prevention because we know that that save taxpayer money and deliver well outcome for people congratulate you on your election madam deputy speaker thank the chancellor for her candour in her statement to the house my constituent will be bitterly disappoint by the consequence of the announcement make in particular in relation to the rebuild of watford hospital it be promise under the last labour government and scrap by the conservative liberal democrat coalition and then promise again and again in the run up to the general election when the conservative party say that the money be definitely there can the chancellor tell where be the money we have hear today that hon and right hon member across the house campaign in good faith on project that they think the money be there for the money simply be not there we can not go on like that which be why have be open transparent and honest about the state of our public finance and the billion black hole leave by the previous government the secretary of state for health and social care my right hon friend the member for ilford north will meet my hon friend the member for watford matt turmaine and all mp who be affect by the problem leave by the previous government congratulation madam deputy speaker on your new role this labour government have choose to take the winter fuel payment away from pensioner the right hon lady do say she will keep it for those on pension credit but the threshold for that be very low that mean someone on an income of just week may find themselves receive nothing it be long establish that be cold increase ill health among vulnerable people what estimate have she make of what her change will cost the nhs pension credit be pay to single person who have an income of just under and for pensioner couple of just under we will indeed keep pension credit for the poor pensioner and boost take up of pension credit to ensure that everybody who be entitle to it get it but we can not make promise the previous government should not have make promise without be able to say where the money be go to come from that be the road to ruin we see that with liz truss and be afraid it be repeat under the current leader of the opposition and the current shadow chancellor they should hang their head in shame for what they have do to our public finance and our public service the obr chair letter reference early suggest that we could now be face one of the large ever year ahead expenditure outside of pandemic this level of cover up would never be tolerate in the private sector do my right hon friend agree that this be exactly why my constituent deserve transparency about the state of the public finance my hon friend speak powerfully on behalf of his constituent in york outer

legacy the previous government leave be even bad than we could have anticipate with billion black hole in the public finance congratulate you on your post madam deputy speaker and the right hon lady on her position as chancellor do the chancellor share the anger of the people of taunton and wellington in find that not only be the whole new hospital promise by the conservatives not fund but that apparently as we now discover even the maternity unit might not be fund on the restore your railway programme will the cancellation of project also apply to those such as wellington station which have already begin fund and have have grip governance for railway investment project stage approval can fully understand why the hon gentleman constituent be so angry with the previous government for leave this mess and make unfunded commitment assure he that project that have already start such as the station he mention will go ahead final question call jim shannon still the strong leg in the chamber madam deputy speaker thank you for call to ask question be very pleased to hear the chancellor statement the clear financial predicament be one that all the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be in together will she confirm that in light of the budget gap and the welcome announcement of the junior doctor pay offer saving will be make in way that do not affect require pay increase at the expense of our health staff but that they will focus on cut back on unnecessary quango on the estimate million of taxpayer money that have be spend on issue such as diversity and inclusion although important they do not deserve priority in public spending or on vanity project such as casement park in northern ireland thank the hon gentleman for his question and for persevere for so long fully agree that the focus should be on frontline public service we have commit ourselves to back office efficiency saving of in all government departments and reining in of consultancy and government communication spending those thing get out of hand under the last government and we will rein they in may end by say this we have be here for two hour and in that time not single conservative member on either the front bench or the back benches have apologise for the state of the public finance and the state of our public service that say all we need to know about the outgoing conservative government and they should never have their hand on power again on point of order madam deputy speaker may raise significant issue that be concern about in relation to the chancellor statement interruption the chancellor obviously do not want to stay in the chamber to hear this in the course of her remark the chancellor appear to indicate that the government have knowingly lay wrong or misleading estimate before the house on thursday last week which differ significantly from what she have present today one working day since those estimate be lay this if true be of serious concern what step can we take to ensure that the government retract either the estimate lay or the document that they produce today and can you tell whether this possibly constitute breach of the ministerial code the hon member will know that the chair be not responsible for the content of contribution make by ministers but be sure that his concern have be hear on the government benches be sure that if an error have be make in this instance the minister will seek to correct it as quickly as possible it be for the government to decide on the estimate that they put before the house far to that point of order madam deputy speaker the chancellor of the exchequer make certain assertion about timing during her statement however we know from the medium that the content of the statement be brief to the guardian at pm on thursday just after the estimate have be vote on while understand that the chair be not responsible for the content of what be say at the dispatch box the chair be responsible for the integrity of document that be lay before the house and on which we vote and rely may ask whether this be matter for the prime minister in his governance of the ministerial code or for the commissioner for standards in his upholding of standard in the house prima facie in the absence of any evidence from the chancellor it look as if we have all be mislead the right hon member will know as well as do that that be not for the chair to decide it be for the government to decide what they put in their estimate and in document that be publish far to that point of order madam deputy speaker the chancellor say for transparency that she have find out about everything this weekend but last week prior to this weekend she say that the treasury have also meet the office for budget responsibility to explain how bad thing be the two can not both be correct could the chancellor come to the house and correct the record have make it very clear that it be not matter for the chair those on the government benches will have hear three point of order on the same subject if they wish to come to the house be sure the chancellor will passenger railway services public ownership bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time at the general election when million of people call time on year of dysfunction disruption and decline they demand change not only in how the country be govern but in how it work because for too many from our economy to our public service the country simply do not work any more the thing on which we rely be let we down too often lifeline have turn into liability that be why this government have already start the work of rebuild britain brick by brick bill by bill five transport bills in this year king speech show not just the scale of our ambition but how transport be at the heart of our plan for change grow the economy become clean energy superpower make our street safe spread opportunity rebuild our nhs whatever this government mission transport be now mission critical be grateful to the transport secretary for give way so early in her comment there be very controversial planning proposal for south leicestershire which be sit on her desk as we speak it be for the hinckley national rail freight interchange be for rail freight interchange but the issue that have unite labour liberal democrat and conservative politician in and around the area be that there be about five other rail freight interchange within mile radius can she give commitment from the dispatch box that whatever she say today will not ride roughshod over the view of labour lead rugby council and conservative lead blaby district council both have very serious concern about this matter be grateful to the hon member for put his view on the record he will know that have quasi judicial role in determine the development consent order for that project he be right to say that it be on my desk now and be consider it carefully nothing in today bill will influence that decision national renewal require nothing less than the big overhaul of our public transport in generation that start with improve performance on our railway and kick start reform which bring we to today bill it should surprise no one in this house when say that our railway be not fit for purpose for two and half year say as much from the opposition benches to no few than three tory transport secretaries would like to take this opportunity to welcome the new shadow transport secretary the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately to her place should note that my three predecessor who sit on this side of the house be no long member be not sure whether it be her job or mine that be curse but wish her luck in the role under three tory transport secretaries we be promise reform yet three year after keith williams review little have change we be promise well service yet some of the worst perform operator be reward with new lengthy contract and hand performance bonus when can we expect to see the shamble that be avanti west coast kick into touch and return to public ownership would certainly welcome that and so would lot of northerner up and down the country have feeling that my hon friend might mention avanti and he know my view one of the first meeting hold as secretary of state be with avanti call it in as one of the worst perform operator with representative of its network rail business unit meeting that be not hold by any of my three predecessor while be shadow secretary of state make it clear that avanti level of performance will not be tolerate and we will use all measure under its national rail contract to hold it to account that do not exclude terminate the contract before it expire if avanti default we be promise high speed to manchester yet that be ax in manchester no less leave west coast main line that be now burst at the seam meanwhile passenger continue to suffer with overcrowded train and poor facility record high cancellation almost one in three train be late some of the most expensive fare in europe and regular bout of industrial action may welcome the minister to her place and wish she well in her new role thank she for bring forward bill to modernise the railway make plea on behalf of those who be disabled whenever we have have debate on the railway in this chamber include adjournment debate the issue of disabled access have come up over and over again do the secretary of state agree that disabled access at all railway station should be bare minimum and must be priority give that we have commuter who must still take private taxi to get to wheelchair friendly station far do she agree that rural community should not be disadvantage by the closure of small stop in order to provide more streamlined timing marvel as always at the hon gentleman ability to find something of interest and relevance to the debate at hand he be absolutely right to say that accessibility be far too often overlook and we make it clear in the plan we set out ahead of the general election that accessibility would be one of the key measure against which we would eventually hold great british railways to account the way in which people with accessibility need be treat by our public transport system be undignifie the broken model that our railway rely on be hold back talent hold back opportunity and hold back britain it must be fix and we be waste no time in do so by amend the railways act today bill will fulfil one of our central manifesto commitment to bring rail passenger service into public ownership it overturn the privatisation by the john major government and allow we to take action as soon as contract expire or early if operator default on their contract it be sensible approach ensure that taxpayer do not fork out huge sum to compensate operate company for end contract early public ownership will become the default option for deliver passenger service instead of the last resort congratulate my right hon friend on her appointment as secretary of state and thank she for bring in this excellent bill since come under the operator of last resort transpennine express which have be one of the worst perform rail company become the most improved operator so will this bill mean that passenger on south western railway will see the same level of improvement and how long will it take my hon friend be absolutely right to say that we have see immediate improvement on bring previously privately run operator into public ownership but we can go far still and that be the benefit of take the two pronged approach that will set out later in my speech she should be in no doubt that south western will be bring into public ownership as will all remain contract within the first term of this government and ideally within the first three year of this bill receive royal assent we will act swiftly have no doubt that we will hear plenty of voice from the opposition benches label this an ideological move those accusation be way off the mark there be nothing ideological about fix what be break and reform what do not work very much welcome this bill and congratulate my right hon friend on all her work in get we to this point since our railway be take out of public ownership ten of billion of pound have be lose to shareholder dividend and the inefficiency of privatised system all while ticket price have soar do she agree that it be high time that we put passenger before profiteer my hon friend be exactly right and that be what be at the heart of these proposal this be an opportunity to genuinely reform our railway from top to bottom to ensure that passenger and grow the railway be the only objective that they should serve not private operator not shareholder not the whim of the engineer that run network rail this be once in generation opportunity to make sure that our public transport system serve the public so it be not ideological what be ideological be the previous government sit back and preside over broken system while passenger and the economy pay heavy price know that the tories have be try to pretend that the last year of failure have not happen but they can not deny that after year of privatisation we find ourselves in position where taxpayer be responsible for of the rail industry income and underwrite almost every penny spend while profit be siphon off to shareholder congratulate my right hon friend on her appointment as secretary of state note that clause of the bill talk about the extension of the current contract could she set out the circumstance in which that could occur because we know that rail safety be good when track and train be bring together as they would be under great british railways clause be purely fail safe if for whatever reason dohl the operator of last resort do not have the capacity to take in private operator contract at the moment it expire we have allow ourselves that flexibility if take on contract be not practically possible but to demonstrate that it be not enable franchising or private operation by the back door we have also include the provision to remove that power again to make sure that public ownership remain the default it will happen only in exceptional circumstance for very limited time as the railway passenger in chief be act decisively today this be the only response to the failure of privatisation to deliver reliable and affordable service for passenger it also make financial sense save ten of million of pound each year in private sector fee that money can now be reinveste in the railway run the railway in the interest of passenger and taxpayer not to the benefit of shareholder also make operational sense will my right hon friend give way yes and will then make some progress congratulate my right hon friend on her new position as long suffer avanti west coast passenger welcome the government prioritisation of this bill but do my right hon friend agree that railway worker should not be outsource will she say little about what she intend to do to ensure that they be not network rail have do considerable amount of work on insource over the last few year and will ask it to do more comprehensive review to see whether there be furth it can do as private operator be bring in their contract and supply chain will be consider to ensure that they be deliver the good possible service for passenger my hon friend raise very important point the case for public ownership should not be controversial after all rail infrastructure be bring into public ownership by the last labour government follow private sector failure germany france and spain our european neighbour all have model of public ownership indeed the architect of the previous government rail reform plan endorse labour plan ahead of the general election as have be say four franchise northern transpennine southeastern and london and north eastern railway be already in public hand and have see some improvement as someone who rely on transpennine accept that it be still far from perfect but cancellation have fall from in january to around since it be take into public ownership lner recently achieve financial surplus which be return to the taxpayer bring the remain operator under public control will take time but as passenger in chief be put they on notice will not tolerate the status quo will not hesitate to demand improvement and will not be afraid to rip up contract early if operator default on their obligation to the public the bill mean that the railway will finally be run for the public by the public but own the house be just the first step next we must fix the crumble foundation that mean fundamental reform no ifs and no but we will set up great british railways as new direct mind run the network both track and train as one integrate system will finally put an end to the fragmentation and waste that make our railway among the least efficient because of their spiral cost and fall revenue compete interest and industry inertia we will build grow innovative railway that be relentlessly and single mindedly focused on passenger there be no question the benefit at stake because gbr will take whole system view we will be able to simplify the overly complex fare system so passenger can be confident that they be get the good value we will take aim at overcrowding by move roll stock to where it be need in the network we will end the piecemeal approach to innovation and roll out benefit such as digital pay as you go and digital season ticket and we will put accessibility at the core of our rail offer so that passenger with disability can expect consistent level of service of course such change do not happen overnight that be why set up gbr and deliver our plan in full will be the focus of separate legislation later in the session but we will not sit back and wait for that legislation to be on the statute book we plan to use every lever available to we urgently to improve service for passenger that include create shadow great british railways which will focus squarely on drive improvement in the short term from ticket to well service this be crucial next step put passenger back at the heart of the railway and fire the starting gun for reform what benefit will this bill bring to my north cornwall constituent who currently do not have single railway station will the secretary of state please explain to they what mainline train service will be come to town in north cornwall such as bude bodmin wadebridge and launceston as the chancellor have set out today we will not only be review the previous government unfunded underfunded and in some place cancel capital project but we will be take forward an integrated long term infrastructure strategy would be delighted to meet the hon gentleman to talk about his constituent need when become transport secretary tell the department that we have new motto move fast and fix thing the passenger railway services public ownership bill the first major piece of legislation under this labour government show we be do exactly that the year privatisation experiment have fail passenger satisfaction remain too low while cost soar even before the pandemic half of all train in the north of england be late all of this failure have consequence community cut off talent stifle and ambition limit it leave britain stick in the siding unable to realise this government mission of economic growth today we start the work of repair bring our railway back into public service restore pride to an industry we should be proud of and take back control so that our railway finally work for everyone wherever they live in this mission be absolutely determined commend the bill to the house it be pleasure to serve under your chairmanship madam deputy speaker congratulation on your election it be my honour to respond to the first second reading of bill move by this new government which see as an opportunity to set the tone for how we will act in opposition we be not go to oppose for the sake of it and do not believe that single person on either side of the house among the public among those work on the rail network or even among those run the train company would say that everything be as it should be with our rail system we be in no doubt that rail need reform covid fundamentally change the way we travel far few people now commute five day week the contract that be bring in to save the railway be now stifle the company they keep afloat and the treasury be subsidise the network day to day run to the tune of billion year so thing need to change that be why in government we commission landmark review into our rail system welcome the fact that labour be take forward our plan for great british railways which be the product of that review join up track and train into single public body will make the system more efficient and save passenger time and money which be important because affordability and reliability be what people care about and the point of be in government be deliver on what people care about rise worry about what this legislation tell we about how the labour party plan to act in government my worry when first see the bill multiply many time over by the chancellor statement to which will return be that it seem to be base solely on ideology there be no evidence barely even suggestion that this bill will actually improve journey for passenger the secretary of state perhaps to her credit have even admit so herself say that she can not promise that fare will be any cheap or that the train will be more likely to run on time the bill be the embodiment of the same old labour mantra that anything run by the state be simply well than anything run by the private sector and that the answer to problem be put politician in charge when it have be prove time and again that that be not the case thank the shadow secretary of state for finally give way she refer to be ideologically wed to certain model of provide railway service will she explain why despite its appalling record avanti west coast be award nine year extension surely that be an ideological decision the wrong decision the point will come to be that the opposition and as shadow secretary of state for transport do not choose to take an ideological approach the important thing be what work if the hon gentleman will hold on for moment and listen to what be come to he will understand my argument confess may be little jealous if the secretary of state be too young to remember life under british rail the dusty carriage the worn seat the clonk and rattle of the carriage door and hour spend wait on desert platform wonder if let alone when the train would ever arrive without any information available even the sandwich be tired it be no wonder that in british rail nearly year history passenger number across the network actually go down there be reason why private provision be introduce into the rail network and why the previous labour government stick with it throughout the year they be in power it work today railway be unrecognisable from that under british rail not despite privatisation but because of it in the first year passenger number double point that labour own rail minister who now sit in the other place make in his report as the head of network rail the majority of that growth be attributable to the private sector involvement and it be achieve while operate one of the safe railway in europe billion of pound of private capital have be invest in roll stock there be now live real time information on service and instead of british rail catering passenger can now choose between the like of and greggs the railway go from cost taxpayer hundred of million of pound year to generate an operate surplus for much of the it be not just taxpayer and passenger that benefit to quote the general secretary of aslef lew adams back in all the time it be in the public sector all we get be cut cut cut and today there be more member in the trade union more train driver and more train run the reality be that it work we often hear it say in this country that our rail system should be more like those in europe where under utopian system of public ownership the train always run on time and every journey cost less than pint of beer however that be not how the european see it in fact in term of the growth in passenger number and the control on cost that privatisation deliver our network be envy by europe laughter know government members would laugh so listen to what have to say on that point will the shadow secretary of state give way will give way but not right now because hear the reaction right now many european country be in the process of unravel their public model they be introduce private provision and competition into their network the dutch the czech and member of the european union will all be very confused to see we hurtle past they in the other direction of course free enterprise do not always succeed that be why we already have system in place for time when state intervention would or at least should benefit passenger as be sure the secretary of state know the department for transport be already run several train operating company such as northern trains which be take into public ownership back in four year ago when the state take it over measly of its train arrive on time today free from the greedy profit vulture who previously feast on its carcase that figure remain at compare that with greater anglia whose contract come up for renewal in september by the way greater anglia be the first train operate company in the secretary of state crosshair and why the government be choose to rush this second read through before recess all of greater anglia service be run new train some of those train arrive within three minute of the scheduled time the company manage to deliver that while pay premium back to the treasury it be not fail in fact every single one of the top five performer across the network be private provider by contrast be hon member aware which company account for more delay than anyone else network rail some of delay be cause by single public sector organisation be old enough to remember british rail on quite lot of measure british rail be improve before it be privatised while the hon lady want to make an ideological attack on state own railway british rail be more efficient than eight comparable rail system in europe use as benchmark in do the hon lady agree with the former secretary of state grant shapps when he admit that the franchise system be no long sustainable what be her idea be perfectly clear at the beginning of my speech that we agree that reform be need that be why we commission review and set out ambitious plan for reform include the great british railways welcome that the new government intend to introduce that be not here to make an ideological argument to respond to the point make by the hon member for runcorn and helsby mike amesbury sometimes like with our plan for great british railways the public sector be the right vehicle to solve problem at other time competitive private model will lead to well result the point be if the government be go to change thing in the first piece of legislation they bring before this house they need some pretty clear evidence as to why so have some question for the secretary of state and the under secretary of state for transport the hon member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood who will be sum up how exactly will bring train operating company into public ownership benefit passenger unfortunately the government impact assessment do not tell we for sure what improvement can passenger expect who be the secretary of state go to get to run these company where be all these different well train operating expert go to come from if they be out there twiddle their thumb in the hope that this day would arrive would the department for transport not have bring they on board already to help with the running of northern train or southeastern it be the same question across the network will she be sack everyone currently work for the train operating company and replace they with horde of superior yet currently out of work staff or as suspect will passenger simply encounter the same group of people in different colour shirt what we need to hear be what tangible difference this go to make for passenger because if the answer be nil then there be lot of other thing she could be do with her time such as prioritise the railway bill the railway bill be the legislation that will actually make difference to how passenger experience our railway with simple ticket join up decision making and efficiency saving that can be pass on to passenger she could be modernise working practice instead of bend over backwards to the union as report suggest she have already do how do she think that create single employer and in the process uplift every rail worker term and condition to the least favourable for passenger will benefit the network she could start by save the train manufacturer hitachi something that when in opposition she say she could do with the stroke of pen notice that it have be three week and that pen be yet to materialise perhaps she no long take for grant the work her predecessor do save the alstom factory in derby or she could prioritise investment in the network like the billion we spend improve the railway since on that point feel for she because know what it be like to argue with chancellor for investment in something and not win that argument it be clear from the chancellor statement early that the secretary of state for transport lose the argument pretty catastrophically rather than set out to reform welfare or control public spending the chancellor opt to slash host of transport infrastructure project she will now review all transport infrastructure plan put the entire transport pipeline into chaos let down community across the country and let down fair few of her new colleague too those new colleague will be dismay to find that they campaign on false promise to the electorate and that their pledge to invest in economic growth and not to raise taxis be not even worth the glossy paper on which their leaflet be write although know what it be like to lose an argument with the chancellor do not share the experience that the secretary of state and many of her colleague will now be go through of change their tune just three week after they be give mandate by the electorate and less than two week after their party leader have say that trust be the new battleground of politic it seem as if he have give up on that battle already all the same welcome the right hon lady to her post and do genuinely wish she well will gladly offer my support to anything that she do to make our railway more reliable and more affordable this bill will not do that it be rush piece of left wing ideology the evidence both here in the uk and across europe show that an effective public private model where the incentive be properly align deliver more choice more passenger and great efficiency over the next few week of recess the secretary of state and her team will have some time to reflect and reconsider hope that they will return in the autumn with bill that jettison the baggage of ideology and take up the mantle of evidence bill that will have more prospect of improve the rail service for passenger because as say have no interest in oppose for opposition sake but this bill as it stand will not be receive the support of his majesty loyal opposition call andy mcdonald congratulate you madam deputy speaker on your elevation as start my contribution wish to put on record how proud be of my relationship with our trade union movement declare both the political and financial support that have receive include from affiliated and non affiliate railway trade union as reflect in my entry in the register of members financial interests it be an immense honour to speak on second reading of this most welcome of bills in the recent election we set out in our manifesto how we will put passenger at the heart of the service by reform the railway and bring they into public ownership with today bill that be what we be do the restoration of our railway to public ownership be something that have spend much time work to achieve in this place especially in the four year from as shadow transport secretary in that role produce shadow white paper entitle gb rail labour plan for nationally integrate publicly own railway it be nice to see that the then transport secretary try to pinch the title but suppose that should be flatter by that in the document set out how the privatised uk railway have not deliver for passenger or taxpayer for long time say when we publish our paper that the railway must be run with the public interest as its primary objective and be look at the sector more broadly not just as passenger service be delighted that this bill be before we today heartily congratulate the secretary of state my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh on secure the first substantive debate and move the first piece of legislation under this labour government the bill be necessary because the privatisation model for britain railway introduce by the major government with the railways act have long be fail passenger even margaret thatcher be reluctant to privatise rail the privatised rail system have put private profit taking before the provision of public service far too many of britain train franchise have be wholly or partly run by the subsidiary of other country publicly own railway company over the year deutsche bahn nederlandse spoorwegen and trenitalia to name just few have extract value out of our railway to pump back into their own home railway yet the only nation state that be preclude from run railway here be our own well all that change today have previously say that the primary aim of britain railway should be support the health of the economy and society not other nation state and small group of private franchise shareholder the outgoing model have result in what be and should function as public service be subsume to the commercial objective to deliver for those shareholder and not the economy or the wide public good at the height of private franchising it be estimate that more than million year in total be go to those company shareholder dividend payment that be unproductive wasteful and the opposite of value for money this have be fund by the fleecing of farepayer the commons library set out that the cost of rail fare have increase by in real term over the past year while average real wage across the economy struggle to match level the additional revenue be not use to remunerate staff rail staff be incredibly hard work public servant employ by private company since and rmt union member should not have need month of industrial action to get pay deal on which they could settle the position be similar with aslef union train driver it sham the conservative party that these driver who have not have pay rise in five year be force to wait for general election and labour transport secretary to hold direct pay talk pay tribute once again to the rail union the rmt aslef and the tssa which keep our rail sector run despite the problem of privatisation and which deserve well deal than they have have in recent year the rise dividend fund by rise fare at the expense of employee pay have be pay out regardless of performance in the most recent statistical release by the office of rail and road of avanti west coast train be cancel in the last quarter and be more than minute late similarly badly of crosscountry train be cancel and be more than minute late under the conservative rail network the private sector take the profit the public sector pick up the piece when thing go wrong when the covid pandemic lead to fall passenger number the government step in to prop up the railway with funding during the recent rail pay dispute the rmt have argue that rail company be be indemnify against any loss to the tune of billion on the same day that there be national strike on the railway well madam deputy speaker the public have have enough they want change and labour be now deliver it the public vote for it we believe that they would do so because polling have always show that they support public ownership and that be right across the political spectrum in yougov poll just after the king speech say that they back public ownership of rail up from at the election that also reflect the increase in support for public ownership of energy something else on which we be make start across the economy it be clear that voter have have enough of rip off privatisation and be embrace public ownership there be much much more that we will achieve enable all of we to travel much more easily and reliably with simple fare connect with other mode of increasingly decarbonise public transport to give our economy and the quality of life massive boost with this marvellous bill my right hon friend have the golden opportunity to make sure that our railway work for our people and our business not for the private profit of train operator look forward to speak with she about the much discuss expansion of rail connection to our capital city and across the northern region from my middlesbrough and thornaby east constituency commend she for the superb job that she have do thus far by bring forward this bill today wish she and the bill every success call wera hobhouse thank you for call to speak madam deputy speaker do not think that have yet have the opportunity to express my pleasure in see you in your new role may also congratulate the right hon lady on secure her new role as secretary of state our railway be in dire need of improvement under the last conservative government passenger be repeatedly fail service be poor and the ticketing system be in shamble all the while the public keep pay more and more year on year rail fare in the uk be already some of the high in europe and be set to rise again be sure that all member of this house have hear about or experience cancellation delay and ticketing system not fit for purpose people be cry out for function rail network that they can rely on too often my bath constituent would rather travel by train but take the car instead because train ticket be far too expensive if we be serious about meet our net zero target and reduce emission rail must be not just green option but an affordable one since privatisation passenger journey have more than double to billion per year however satisfaction be at its low level in over year we agree with the government that competition be not work as intend few and few company be bid for new franchise as the cost have balloon meanwhile government subsidy have increase and intervention be desperately need the uk need world class rail network to support growth and reach net zero for too many year it have be hold back by under investment and lack of ambition particularly in the north and south west however may ask what will happen to investment after nationalisation when great british rail will have to compete for funding with the nhs and school be sure this government will agree with we that they must guarantee that funding for nationalise rail network will not come at the expense of other public service we liberal democrats want the fair deal for passenger anything that bring down fare be welcome and look forward to the government set out how service will improve when in public hand nationalisation be an interesting idea but liberal democrats want an approach that benefit passenger right away we would freeze fare immediately and then get on with reform to the broken system passenger might not be that interested in who be run the train but they be interested in whether they be run on time and at fair price there be inconsistency within the propose policy just as private company do now great british rail will continue to lease roll stock roll stock leasing company benefit from monopoly out of the privatisation and make excess profit one quarter of operator cost go to those company and hope the government will urgently look into that the liberal democrat approach be pragmatic we will scrutinise the legislation accord to what be good for passenger we want one nationwide body with proper power to put investment in the right place and hold train company to account our proposal be for railway agency to act as guide mind for the railway put commuter first hold train company to account and bring in wholesale reform of the break fare system it be currently unclear what the financial impact of nationalisation will be there be potential saving due to management and performance fee no long be payable however subsidy might increase after nationalisation private operator be already subsidise to run unprofitable service and public sector company would similarly need financial support which might increase over time we be put down these concern to make sure that we be properly hold the government to account on their proposal can the government really ensure that funding will be adequate without fare increase far there be no reason for nationalise company purely base on their contract expiry date the government should start by focus attention on operator that be demonstrably fail passenger gbr could then focus on turn those service around to deliver tangible improvement for the public the government should at least look at that and operator that be perform well should be deprioritise that would be well for traveller and reduce the cost to taxpayer there be other question that we need clarity on when the contract be up will train operating company go straight to great british rail or to the operator of last resort if it be to the operator of last resort what incentive will there be for operator to grow rail revenue which be still at of pre pandemic level large olr team will be necessary to manage the increase number of rail journey while gbr be be set up the explanatory note to the bill do not consider that increase cost all that must be part of wide long term rail strategy instead of fixate on the issue of ownership our railway need rapid and significant change to put passenger first with focus on the quality of service we be interested in look at what benefit nationalisation will bring but we urge the government to be pragmatic call josh dean to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker be grateful for the opportunity to make my first contribution in this house and welcome you to your place follow your election congratulate all hon member and hon friend who have give their maiden speech over previous day they have be reminder of the immense talent of those join this house and what privilege it be for to be among they look forward to hear their many contribution to debate over the come month and year begin by pay tribute to my predecessor julie marson who serve our resident for four and half year thank julie for her hard work in help to secure banking hub to protect our resident access to in person banking service in part of our community work that look forward to continue know that the whole house will want to join in wish julie and her family the very good for the future it be the honour of my life to represent the community where grow up and that call home as the first labour mp in hertford and stortford year history our town centre in hertford give my first job our railway carry to the university education think have miss out on and although be not sure that at age count as an old boy of the school be proud former student of richard hale be deeply humble by the trust that our resident have place in and will work every day to ensure that it be repay hertford and stortford be historic community when plague overrun london in the this parliament move to hertford castle where the gatehouse be now home to hertford town council bishop stortford be suspect to be roman new town and may once have sit at an ancient transport interchange sawbridgeworth boast architecture from the tudor stuart and georgian period and ware be home to malt make industry that last from the civil war to the century our constituency represent so much of what be great about our country hard work community historic town and hub of innovation creativity and commerce have the chance to visit one such hub of innovation on recent visit to wickham hall in bishop stortford there be inspire by david and suzy harvey self style custodian of the countryside whose creativity and passion have transform year old family farm into thriving business community make use of the green technology of the future and with mission to protect our environment our natural environment be as diverse as it be beautiful with some of britain rare chalk stream of which our resident be rightly fiercely protective run right through our constituency therefore warmly welcome this government commitment to clean up our precious water will work tirelessly within this house and in my community to ensure that they be protect today many of our hertford and stortford resident will travel to and from work use our local railway whether they be go from one town to the next from our constituency into london or even far however when speak to resident in our community too often hear story of broken rail network that be not work for local people indeed just today one of my resident contact to say that yet more service have be cancel to hertford north this evening due to lack of staff our railway be once the pride of britain connect people and place with new opportunity but the current model of privatisation be fail passenger and staff across the country be hearten by my right hon friend the secretary of state promise to move fast and fix thing we know that publicly own passenger focus rail can deliver the efficient high quality and reliable service that our hertford and stortford resident need and make our railway something to be proud of once again have not follow traditional path through life as my sometimes frustrated parent would agree leave school at and go straight into work first in my town centre then commute into london before work in recruitment in local business park return to education during lockdown enrol at the university of westminster to study perhaps unsurprisingly politic blissfully unaware that in few year time would be desperately try to navigate the corridor of this place would not have find the path that be right for have it not be for the inspirational work of our youth club in hertford and stortford and it be to they that wish to pay tribute now have experience at first hand the difference that their work make to the life of our young people and can say with confidence that have it not be for the support and guidance of youth worker name russell cairns would not be in this chamber today have since have the privilege of visit the thirst youth café in bishop stortford and volunteering at futurehope youth café in the very building where once seek advice from russell look forward to work with they and many other as our member of parliament to ensure that every young person in our community be support to find the path that be right for they just as be support to find mine hope can also show our young people that if they wish the path they choose can lead they here during the election have the chance to visit some of our local school take part in husting at herts and essex high school in bishop stortford and answer the question of sixth former at leventhorpe school in sawbridgeworth and richard hale school in hertford be strike by their insightful question and genuine passion for politic we know that young people be at the sharp end of so many of the crisis we face today whether it be the climate crisis or the crisis in housing and mental health but too often they feel powerless to make difference and that politics be not place for they be proud to be young person represent his community join this place among cohort of young parliamentarian but it be incumbent on all of we to show our young people that they have place not only in politic but in this parliament too and look forward to work with colleague across the house to make that happen finally would like to reflect on two people without whom would not be here my mum and dad my mum teach in local school before become special educational need co ordinator have grow up watch she give so much to her profession in often challenging circumstance hers be the story of teacher and support staff across our school across the country and she continue to be an inspiration to as be my dad who now live just outside bishop stortford and like so many of our resident commute into london every day my parent move to hertford in the late because they want the good start for can not think of well moment than now to thank they for everything they have give over the last year my parent be example of hard work and dedication principle that they have instill in and those be principle that will carry with every day as go to work in this place congratulate you on your new role madam deputy speaker also congratulate the hon member for hertford and stortford josh dean on make his maiden speech be sure that he will learn and appreciate as the week month and even year go by that there be time when we will argue and debate in this place but there be many thing that we also have in common like he leave school and do not go to university until much later in life the other common point will mention will come to this in my contribution be the importance of rail link to our local community they create link to opportunity for young and old alike sincerely wish he well be clear in my contribution to the king speech debate that where agree with the government will say so as former rail minister would be one of the first to agree that the rail system need reform post pandemic we have see that commuting and business travel have change beyond all recognition but so too have leisure travel and the demand have change greatly the current system need to make great use of the public private model but crucially it must also have great passenger focus there be franchise train operating company in great britain with let we be honest level of operational performance and cancellation that vary dramatically as be sure all across the house would agree there be nothing more frustrating for someone than arrive at the train station on their way home at the end of the day or at the end of the week from this place only to find that their train be delay or bad still have be cancel for example at one end of the spectrum we have avanti west coast one of the bad performer its contract expire in let we contrast that with west midlands train one of the much well performer its contract expire in september this year would hope that if the new government be truly passenger focused and want to get we move forward they would seek to address the bad performer first have few question that hope the secretary of state or her minister will answer in their summing up what do the bill actually mean for passenger have yet to understand that fully have yet to hear the secretary of state confirm that price will be cheap but perhaps she can do so today we have hear that there will be focus on the taxpayer but what about the traveller for too many rail travel be still unaffordable and fear that it will become more unaffordable under these proposal what about the other aspect of the service will clean contract be nationalise what about catering will we see return to the day of the british rail sandwich do not think be quite old enough to remember those day but have it on good authority that the british rail sandwich be somewhat emblematic of the unappetise fare of the nationalisation of our railway what about ticket office and ticketing we have hear that there should be improvement to ticketing but what plan do the secretary of state have will she keep they open or close they will there be more staff out on the platform to help passenger the right hon member mention ticket office closure remind she that that be the proposal from her previous government it may well have be but be here to scrutinise the government of the day will be the first to recognise that where ticket office be sell one ticket day it make much well sense to have those operator out on the platform help people with for example accessibility issue and the machine this whole point be about be truly passenger focused would also like to well understand what the investment will be in the training of train driver it take very long time for train driver to be fully train for any give route without sufficient number of train driver we end up be in hock to the union similarly would like to understand whether the new government truly believe in seven day railway service because that be what passenger expect we expect train to operate not just from monday to friday but for seven day week would therefore expect any rail operator particularly under nationalisation to offer that service as well on open access would like great understanding of what that model will look like will it be keep or not the reason ask that be really parochial and community focused my constituency be one of the very few that do not have train station hon member may become rather tired of say this in the forthcoming week and month but under the former mayor of the west midlands we secure fund through the city region sustainable transport settlement work with the council to move forward we have the train line and the site identify for the car park everything be go forward we even have an open access operator that be look to put in service from wales direct to euston which would be an absolute game changer for young and old alike in my constituency sadly the new mayor of the west midlands will not confirm that that project be go ahead he prefer to hide behind review and after today announcement by the chancellor fear that she be probably back he and encourage he down that route as ever though remain hopeful and wait to be convince otherwise as we have hear today great british railways be not an entirely new idea when we be in government our plan be to set it up as public entity join track and train across the country however what we have in front of we today be very different we have ideological nationalisation risk taxpayer money and plan that the government can not confirm will reduce cost or increase capacity or reliability in short it do not put the fare pay passenger first this be political choice call paul foster to make his maiden speech thank you mr speaker for afford the honour and opportunity to make my maiden speech today have listen intently to many speech over the past few day and congratulate all those who have make their maiden speech rise with slight trepidation in my aspiration to match the passion and eloquence of other who have speak in such an inspiring way about their constituency life experience and priority commend they all would like to start by pay tribute

more young people to take on the skilled career that would be possible with the high tech employer in stevenage she be then part of the labour government who place education at the heart of their programme from early year right through to advanced qualification now the challenge in stevenage as across so much of the country be to ensure that there be home in which people can grow up work hard and grow old with dignity it be painful irony that the original resident of our new town now watch as their child and grandchild face down the lost dream of home ownership or even rent home that be why be so pleased that priority for this labour government be to build many more new home to meet this housing emergency include new town just like stevenage be delighted that another labour woman

first go to philip asterley jones elect in he deserve to be remember for champion the building of stevenage new town despite many misgiving at the time then think might be another first one reaction

be another first gerald strickland the member for lancaster in the and subsequently prime minister of malta can confirm have no plan to follow his career path think the point in life be that be the first be not as important as acknowledge how you achieve your dream and ambition not alone but thank to the support of other my mum and dad move to this country from malta when be an eight year old boy they work hard so that my brother and could wish for nothing be also lucky to have teacher who believe in so that could believe in myself from young age my mum and dad instill in that if you see problem you roll up your sleeve and you fix it since then have do just that have work as solicitor get justice for victim of the phone hack scandal also serve for over decade as councillor and an

great british railways and bring train operator into public ownership resident in stevenage and our village be striver they work hard to build well life for themselves and their family key to that be properly integrate rail network that be affordable on time and accessible alongside my strong support for the bill will be lobby for the restoration of the knebworth express to bring back fast train in and out of london to knebworth station because those who live in village have no less aspiration to succeed than those who live in town will also work hard to ensure that accessibility in stevenage station be priority from ensure full time working lift to secure the future of the ticket office as start the work in my constituency of return the role of mp to its found purpose public service also stand ready to support our new government in deliver on the change that our country need ask the new government just one thing look back to the great reform agenda of the labour governments in and who build our new town revolutionise the life prospect of generation and transform our public service aspiration be their watchword and aspiration have remain the very essence of town such as stevenage ever since now look to the present day in let we recapture the imagination innovation and vision that our predecessor show and carry it forward to transform the life of this generation and the generation to come thank all the member who have give their maiden speech it be move to hear all of they particularly the hon member for hertford and stortford josh dean be make note of everybody who mention youth service and he do some very good advocacy he be on my list it be great to be speak on my first bill in the house and that it be bill that bring passenger railway service back into public hand the fact that this measure make it through the dramatic sift of labour policy that take place before the election and be among the first and most urgent piece of new legislation we be look at be believe in no small way due to the secretary of state own commitment to this policy and her dedicated internal advocacy for it wish that more of her colleague have be so willing and determine to push for similar bills to bring other privatised service such as water and the big six energy company into public hand but that do not diminish my delight this evening recently mention to she how much be look forward to scrutinise and where necessary help to improve other upcoming bills under her remit include the bus bill and the more detailed railway bill this be all great work as far as this bill key principle be concern the secretary of state will have notice that public ownership be popular with and be popular with the people in that principle be support for the railway by of the public that support have rise steadily for the past decade it be even back before the election by of those intend to vote conservative bring the railway back into public hand have be in my party programme for as long as can remember it be also close to the heart of my constituent in brighton pavilion for whom the legacy of the fail policy of privatisation be one of poor service inefficiency and very high cost for passenger an annual season ticket between brighton and london currently cost my constituent the good part of that cost have rise by approximately in the past year far more than wage in brighton have rise in the face of service cut and failure to invest passenger have have to form local pressure group such as the preston park train campaign to save service in so many station understaffe and disabled access remain dreadful create appalling discrimination against passenger and do get start on toilet provision be not just here to praise the bill or celebrate its principle do have some question and comment all to be constructively take hope the bill be very short and very simple and wonder whether it could benefit from some additional detail and wide scope will keep my comment brief at this stage but on each point would welcome more detail from the secretary of state on her thinking also request meeting with she to discuss the issue before committee of the whole house first want to talk about the exception from the bill from the information have it appear that the bill will not bring into public ownership the regional service currently let by concession contract include the elizabeth line mersey rail and the london overground or any of the service on open access route include eurostar grand central heathrow express hull train and lumo for passenger hear the government promise to bring private operator into public hand but then hear that service they use will be exclude will be disappointment hope we will hear more soon about how those gap will be fill also out of scope as the bill title indicate be rail freight service the public might have expect those private operator to be among the first for action especially as get freight off the road and on to rail have so many benefit in address road danger congestion and climate emission another exception from this bill to bring passenger railway back into public hand be the roll stock company quite honestly most member of the public do not have much awareness of it but the roll stock in which we travel be another public asset that be worthy of public investment and should not be hold merely for private rent and profit by company that add no real value to the service at the very least the bill could have include prohibition on new arrangement of that kind finally feel that there be potential gap in the government plan around rail devolution the bill definition of public sector company will allow franchise to pass only to company wholly own by the secretary of state or her counterpart in wales and scotland not to those own by other elect body whose remit include or might in future include manage transport in an integrated way within an area of the country be very interested in far explore the secretary of state thinking on that because green principle close to my heart be subsidiarity make sure that ownership and power be devolve to the low and most practical level in the case of integrated multimodal transport planning and investment particularly for day to day travel the good level be often regional or sub regional travel to work area at that level of planning sustainable travel across different mode can be link up in responsive network with convenient interchange rational timetable and share ticket across mode profitable commuter route on railway might also directly help to cut car dependency in isolated village by subsidise essential connectivity by bus for example this kind of transport planning be well do alongside and in tandem with planning for new home and business for which the right scale be also regional or sub regional area work with the involvement of local authority people and workplace like many people be slightly concerned about the centralising tendency that we can detect in range of recent action from the leadership of our new government hope that it will not dominate transport and planning policy in this house if the secretary of state agree to meet as request will be very interested to hear more about how she expect the upcoming devolution bill to interact with this bill and with the future railway bill in respect of her plan for how centralise the future planning management and ownership of transport as whole will be admittedly the place in england where this kind of devolution apply and where rail franchise might sensibly pass to company own by city and region in the near future be currently very few however when we have franchise serve nearby metro mayor area such as transpennine express and northern which be already under the wing of the department for transport when the mayor of london already have his sight firmly set on take over specific service and when there might as hope be great devolution of power to combined authority and area in the south east region and sussex where now represent many people dependent on rail service it do seem strange to introduce bill that appear to need amendment to rule in such an exciting prospect when the government be about to give more power to local authority to run bus it also seem strange not to help they to work together to run suitable railway will the secretary of state explain what plan there be to well link up railway and bus service will she discuss they with before committee those be all my comment and question be very much look forward to the future and be look to help build the good future we can from this new and refreshing approach of public ownership reiterate how pleased be to be make such speech rather than one bitterly complain about government who have completely the wrong idea hope that my question and caution will be take in that spirit call jon pearce to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your elevation congratulate all today maiden speaker and particularly my hon friend the member for stevenage kevin bonavia stevenage be very lucky to have such fine advocate he be an impossible act to follow perhaps be like kula shaker come on after oasis in but will do my good assure you that will be brief madam deputy speaker the good advice have in preppe for this be from good friend who say no matter how good speech be no one have ever say wish that have be long hon member more thank you so much for give the opportunity to make my maiden speech on bill that be so important for my constituent in high peak for the country and for personally when be young my father work on british rail as storeman the store be vast warehouse teem with worker in train manufacturing and maintenance the privatisation of britain railway by john major government result in thousand of job loss between and the number of rail worker in this country decrease from quarter of million to those be not just number they be real life like those of my dad friend and workmate the fear that my dad would be next and about what that would mean for my family be an unwelcome guest that linger far too long in our house childhood experience like that never leave you the dignity and opportunity of secure well pay job must be the foundation on which we deliver the economic growth that high peak and britain need look forward to use my experience as an employment lawyer to help we to deliver new deal for work people be the pain and the sacrifice make by the family affect by the privatisation of our railway worth it do privatisation deliver the competition the great efficiency and the well railway service that it promise the commuter in glossop new mills whaley bridge chapel and buxton will tell you with barely dissent voice no frequent delay cancellation and overcrowding have become the norm while rail fare have increase by more than in real term mean that passenger in britain face some of the high fare in europe rail privatisation mean pay more get less research suggest that every pound invest in public transport generate in economic benefit since privatisation too many of those pound have be go into shareholder pocket and not into improve service for passenger in alone the roll stock company pay out more than million to their shareholder that injustice be not fair on my constituent in high peak and it be hold back our economy high peak should be the good place to live in the country we have strong community rich history of tourism date back year to when the romans develop the first spa around the warm water spring that still bubble under buxton to this day rich history in the art be home to both vivienne westwood and hilary mantel and rich history in deliver access to nature be the setting for the mass trespass and britain first national park the peak district high peak be the most beautiful constituency in the country interruption be sense maybe few murmuring have read my brief and respect the importance of be accurate so while write this speech put down my pen and take moment to gaze out of my window with the vista of hope valley in the foreground and the majesty of the tor beyond feel comfortable in reaffirm that high peak be truly without equal sadly despite our beauty that be high peak not my own we be all too often overlook at the northernmost point of derbyshire not quite in greater manchester and just on the edge of south yorkshire we have be no one priority for too long no more it be high time that high peak get its fair share our fair share of economic growth our fair share of well public service and our fair share of investment integrated transport through great british railways take back control of our bus and build the mottram bypass the latter of which commend my predecessor robert largan on championing have the potential to be the catalyst move high peak from the edge of everywhere to the economic centre connect the two core northern city of manchester and sheffield that be how we will deliver high peak its future back attract business investment encourage tourism and restore pride in our town again that future start where my story begin with the railway back in public ownership call claire young to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for this opportunity to make my maiden speech may congratulate you on your recent election also congratulate all those who have make maiden speech today particularly the hon member for high peak jon pearce who speak so passionately about the beauty of his constituency and the childhood experience that he bring to this house be honour to have be elect by the people of thornbury and yate to be their voice and champion here in parliament ours be beautiful and hugely varied rural constituency with the town of thornbury yate and chipping sodbury and many village stretch from hill falfield and charfield in the north to bridge yate siston and wick in the south to the east be the cotswold escarpment part of designate national landscape to the west be the severn estuary ramsar wetland of international importance and formerly home to the aust ferry make famous by bob dylan there be much worth visit locally from historic attraction such as dyrham park and acton court to the more modern bristol zoo project carry out important international conservation work while not far away hesitate to mention this when my leader my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey might be listen there be an artificial inland surfing lake call the wave there be real history of innovation locally although sadly my own parish of frampton cotterell claim to the invention of the stetson hat appear to be little more than an urban legend however we can be proud that the pioneer of vaccination edward jenner start his medical training in chipping sodbury nowadays many of my constituent work in cut edge industry in our region such as aerospace with background in math and software engineering take keen interest in see those industry flourish and want to ensure that our young people can benefit from the opportunity they bring my constituency be of course more than its landscape and history it be the people who live there and their fantastic community spirit see that in my own village during the pandemic when hundred of volunteer rally to help other whether it be the big lunch in chipping sodbury the yate ageing better festival thornbury carnival or any myriad other event and group they all contribute to make the constituency wonderful place to live thank my predecessor luke hall who serve thornbury and yate for nine year during which time he champion neonatal care leave and hold post in the department for education and the ministry of housing communities and local government wish he and his family all the good for the future also thank his predecessor the former pensions minister sir steve webb who have be great source of wisdom for and be fondly remember by many constituent he set very high bar for all his successor and will do my good to meet it while be thank people put on record my gratitude to councillor maggie tyrrell who have recently succeed as the leader of south gloucestershire council know that the council be in safe hand as bring that experience to this place be grateful for the opportunity to make this speech in this important debate because if we be to tackle the climate crisis and cut congestion on our road we must get rail service back on track to give people genuine alternative to get around effectively there be currently three railway station in my constituency yate station be reopen in the and we desperately need the propose redevelopment will also be seek to ensure that the funding for half hourly service be extend beyond the current end date of that will not only benefit yate but provide an hourly train for the new station plan at charfield the station at pilning be parliamentary station with just one train run week to avoid formally close it its location near the grow industrial location of severnside mean that if properly reopen it be prime place to help the many worker who travel from south wales to make the trip without car the third station be severn beach once seaside resort the line now serve commuter however commuter can be leave disappoint by flood on the line as well as the fact that the service be not more frequent rail campaigner be also keen to see other station reopen such as coalpit heath and thornbury but for that to be possible we need national investment in westerleigh junction to increase capacity and unlock this potential hope that the secretary of state will commit to make that part of the integrate infrastructure review that be reference early as my hon friend the member for bath wera hobhouse say ultimately passenger be not interested in who run the train they simply want they to run on time and for the ticket to be affordable give the continue squeeze on people finance we need an immediate freeze on rail fare and our fragmented ticketing system need simplify to cut cost for commuter we also need to think about integration with other form of public transport in my constituency we have see serious cut to local bus service with many village leave with no regular bus at all my aim in this place will be to champion the right of people to have affordable and green method of transport whether they live in rural or urban area in conclusion promise to work tirelessly for my constituent not only on fix our railway but on other issue too such as the fact that our school be among the low fund in the country and that it be almost impossible to register with an nhs dentist locally look forward to work constructively with right hon and hon member across the house to address these problem and ensure that the people of thornbury and yate get the fair deal they deserve call

harvinder my son pavandeep my daughter gurkirta my mum bhajan kaur josan my nephew gagandeep puneetpal and ishmeet who be all here in the gallery have be elect to represent constituency that be embed in my heart sit on the benches of government who will serve the people know that there be incredibly hard work ahead that there will be disagreement and robust word and difficult decision will need to be make but be committed to serve this house and the voter of smethwick to the good of my ability congratulate you on your election to the chair madam deputy speaker also congratulate the secretary of state for transport and her colleague on their appointment and wish they all the good will start by give the house commitment that will not make any laboured or tedious comment about curly british rail sandwich welcome the fact that the new government be give legislative time to transport at this early stage give that it be vital policy area that be often neglect some might even consider it cinderella topic for this house it be positive contrast to the previous conservative government who preside over industrial relation chaos utterly incomprehensible contract extension for fail train operator such as avanti west coast which many member have be plague by and crosscountry and lack of any meaningful fare or industry reform be one of few member of this house to arrive here follow career on the railway pay tribute to the hon member for smethwick gurinder josan and commend he for his excellent speech praise the diversity of his seat have have the privilege of visit soho train maintenance depot during my career on the railway in the west midland would like to give some insight from my professional experience work both for state own network rail and private sector train operating company it be important for everyone in this debate to remember that nearly all the infrastructure and the operation of third of all daily train service be already publicly own the previous labour government rightly take action follow the safety and financial failure of private sector railtrack by create network rail in which be quickly able to tackle safety and performance issue however my experience of two stint work at network rail for total of year be that as very large publicly own organisation at time silo working and bureaucracy can be barrier to achieve result some of the issue face network rail either in or near my constituency include infrastructure reliability problem on the great western main line severely overrun engineering work affect the botley road and many local resident in oxford and very long construction processing for read green park station it be important to note that be in the public sector do not inherently make everything well in the privatised train operating company that work for some of the main barrier to progress be the result not so much of they be private sector but the lack of incentive to invest due to short franchise or contract term and micromanagement by the department for transport and the treasury in september join london midland train operator that notionally be in the last year of its franchise that mean that key investment decision be defer such as on train wi fi timetable improvement and car park enhancement it feel as if be catch in star temporal paradox since when leave london midland in may it be still in the last year of its franchise as no decision have be make about the franchising process that be an example of how the potential private sector benefit to the railway have often not be realise because of the flawed approach to franchising rather than the nature of the private sector there be example of positive private sector contribution perhaps the most significant of which be the benefit of chiltern railways year franchise which see investment in new station at warwick parkway and the evergreen upgrade of the chiltern main line both of which deliver significant passenger benefit and be genuinely heavily fund by the private sector have we have more long term franchise like that thing might be very different today the bill will not tackle the issue of train be own privately and lease back often increase the whole cost to operator the current leasing arrangement can also create perverse incentive on roll stock retention as result of cliff edge impose by lease duration and renewal date this have create shortage of capacity on number of part of the network in recent year as short term financial decision have be take to avoid roll stock lease extension for example on southern with class train and great northern with class train government plan to leave freight and open access operator in private hand may indicate inconsistency with the view that the private sector can not deliver good service most seriously the state versus private sector debate do nothing to tackle the lack of clear vision for what the government want the railway to achieve or deliver as other member have say fare continue to be complicated and often expensive there be lack of integrate timetable within the railway and with other transport mode and the role of the office of rail and road regulator need examination be therefore pleased that the new government have further plan that hope will address those point implore they to move beyond the public versus private debate and focus on what current and prospective rail user need do so will be crucial to achieve real focus on customer service which be need to grow patronage and achieve modal shift so that the railway can thrive as part of wide sustainable and efficient transport system call laurence turner to make his maiden speech congratulation on your election madam deputy speaker it be privilege to follow so many excellent maiden speech this evening include from my hon friend the members for hertford and stortford josh dean for south ribble mr foster for stevenage kevin bonavia for smethwick gurinder josan and for high peak

passenger service transport have sometimes be see in this place as an unfashionable department stop off point for ambitious politician on the way up and occasionally on the way down but it be clear that this attitude be not hold by this front bench team or this new government there be however some historical basis for that view when barbara castle be appoint transport minister harold wilson tell she your job be to produce the integrated transport policy we promise in our manifesto could work something out myself give half an hour when nicholas ridley tell margaret thatcher that he want to privatise the railway she respond railway privatisation will be the waterloo of this government never mention the railway to again down the year hon member on the conservative benches must have

the northfield constituency as it be elsewhere pocket of relative affluence sit cheek by jowl with deprivation the historic village centre of king norton and northfield lie short distance from the new estate like weoley castle that be build to serve the need of birmingham grow economy the fortune of the constituency rise and fall with those of birmingham but the seat be also define by its outer estate new frankley rubery and allens cross which be distant and distinct from the city centre all these community face common challenge include crime and antisocial behaviour and the decline of the traditional high street they have be hit hard by cut to neighbourhood policing and by the decision last year to not proceed with the regeneration of northfield high street there be much to do for most of the constituency history it be well know for the longbridge car plant which also draw in worker from the surround area of west heath rednal and beyond for year longbridge pay handsomely into the national purse and it be essential to our defence in time of crisis during the second world war longbridge and its shadow factory produce many of the armament and aircraft that keep our nation free if the house will excuse diversion be remind at this point of my grandad story often repeat with pride to we as child about his time station at the air defence at billeseley common when he almost fire rocket at an encroaching german plane the site that begin as the austin work be an important part of our national life at its peak it employ some people model from the austin to the metro become part of our share culture it be hard to believe that next year will mark the anniversary of longbridge closure that occasion must be mark appropriately in birmingham and in parliament the site be now home to an ambitious redevelopment project and importantly some manufacture job be return but travel just short distance and the scar of that closure be still plain to see the male employment rate remain staggering point low than in birmingham as whole shamefully average monthly wage be low in the constituency than they be in after inflation the scourge of in work poverty be never far away today my constituent be most likely to be employ in public service be proud to be the son of two teacher even if sadly the headquarters of the nasuwt the teachers union which my parent be member of for many year be just over the border in the neighbouring constituency of bromsgrove there will be more to say much more in this parliament about the funding and delivery of service in birmingham it be enough to say today that after year of severe cut the second city be bleed and welcome the statement that the new government have make about the importance of put local government funding on sustainable footing the new government plan to establish fair pay agreement for adult social care and to reinstate the school support staff negotiate body will also make real material and long overdue difference to thousand of low pay worker in the northfield constituency most of they woman who be proud to help represent as an officer of the gmb union and whose skill and professionalism have be undervalue for too long if could achieve one thing in the time have in this place it would be to secure improvement to special educational need and disability provision it be cause that be close to my heart be one of those child know what it mean to have to fight to avoid be define by other people low expectation know the stigma that be the mark of attitude that be still common and from word that will not repeat in this place wish that could say otherwise but it never leave you know too that child life can turn on access to an identification or single decision about adjustment and resource or even for the want of few encouraging word so if speak for moment in anger it be because too many child and family in birmingham and beyond face barrier that be high now than they be year ago in breach of the promise that life for each generation will be well than for the last it be not enough to fight for people within fail system we have to change it that be one of the cause come to parliament to advocate for and welcome the commitment on send make by the education secretary and the prime minister in the early day of this parliament would like to end by talk about family before come generation of factory worker electrician and shopkeeper painter and polisher cleaner and coachbuilder jewellery maker and japanner some escape famine shadow who be bear in birmingham or who come to call the city

take forward one of the early bills of labour government for too long my constituent have pay high fare in exchange for unreliable train service and crumble infrastructure have commute throughout my work life nearly year have experience at first hand the effect of three decade of fragmented fail privatised system under the tories fare rise almost twice as fast as wage and cancellation soar to record level while fail train company executive boast of receive free money from taxpayer the privatisation experiment have fail britain railway be break uk government subsidy and passenger fare have benefit not only private company but foreign government train on uk railway be almost entirely own by foreign state entity ironically that mean that my commuting constituent be effectively subsidise rail passenger in france germany and italy as be explain so well early by my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald labour bold and progressive plan to bring rail passenger service into public ownership popular policy support by of voter in may will address and rectify those failure might add that it be because we have leave the european union that we now have the freedom to implement this reform without be constrain by the eu third railway package which require that passenger service be open up to international market competition and the extraction of profit that entail our bill will save taxpayer ten of million of pound annually that be currently pay out in fee to private sector operator as demonstrate by the now publicly run lner which submit million dividend to the department for transport in this money will be use to introduce good price guarantee for ticketing to improve timetable co ordination to reduce delay and to grant automatic refund for delay and cancellation put passenger back at the heart of the service our plan will also benefit worker across our rail system include some of my friend who be very loyal to our railway commend both aslef and the rmt for their long stand campaign in support of the renationalising of our railway and stress the importance of work closely with union to ensure fair condition and respect for all rail worker too refer member to my declaration of interest and be proud to do so while this bill address passenger service it be only the beginning of our plan the wide future railway bill

towards fully integrate railway system give that we be talk about railway must take the opportunity to highlight briefly the state of luton station despite the long await access for all commitment to the installation of lift due to start this summer the station be not fit for purpose for the century and need full regeneration have campaign on the state of luton station since be first elect as an mp with few small win include ensure that part of the station canopy be fix and successfully keep the ticket office open should like to raise the issue of its full regeneration with the new ministerial team and their official and will be in touch with the new secretary of state to raise it on behalf of my constituent be very pleased that the labour government will provide reliable safe efficient accessible and affordable transport system that support our five national mission by for example promote green transport option and facilitate key worker commute this bill mark historic first step towards create an integrated publicly own railway an achievement of which labour can be truly proud first will cover some of the maiden speech that have be make by various new member have the pleasure of do mine in the king speech debate and think we have have nine so far this evening well do to everyone find it quite nerve rack and it be bit easy speak second time will not mention all the name of members constituency other people have do that but the issue cover strike chord with we hear from former council leader and be former council leader national park be mention and have national park in my constituency new station be also mention and have one of they as well many thing be cover in the maiden speech bob dylan and knebworth particularly take my fancy as be bit of rocker to return to the subject at hand two of the maiden speech mention water quality with nationalise water company in scotland we have some of the good water quality in the uk and among the low number of leak it be also one of the low cost water company in the uk which tie in neatly with rail nationalisation be sure that those on the government benches will be pleased to hear the snp support that as we be proud of introduce it in scotland two year ago be pleased to see government in place who want to go down that route which be very positive in the past two year we have see punctuality and reliability improve scotrail be now fourth out of the franchise on performance with significant reduction in serious delay and cancellation do not really understand the argument that have be give by some of those on the conservative benches who say that nationalisation as oppose to privatisation and private profit be not the answer and might not deliver low price one big benefit as result of nationalisation be that we have be able to run pilot on remove all peak fare across scotland which have be so successful that it have now be extend hope that we will be in position to make that permanent feature it have be very well receive and be demonstration of how we can drive down fare in public ownership model as have say certainly welcome labour follow suit my understanding from colleague in the scottish government be that there have be really good communication between the two government which be very welcome can not imagine that the experience would have be perfect for colleague in the scottish government it have not be do before but hope that share what happen two year ago and in the interim will be helpful and that we can find common ground hope that other propose legislation will address one area that have concern about at the moment the bill apply only to train operating company but the most profitable part of the system be the roll stock leasing company which couple of member mention they generate hundred of million of pound of profit for the private sector and lead to soar leasing cost private investment and high price the reward have be privatise but the risk have be put on the public purse some billion be pay out in dividend during covid with the bulk go to jurisdiction such as luxembourg and jersey that bring to the point that the chancellor make about tax avoidance and try to increase the amount take by his majesty revenue and customs have give an example of company take huge amount of money out of the private sector and pay out those dividend in other jurisdiction would like to see that tackle and hope that the minister will cover that in sum up will say final thing about public investment we have manage to open up three new line in scotland the borders railway the levenmouth railway and the alloa railway we have open numerous new station and there be huge amount of enthusiasm as many member will know few body be as enthusiastic as those involve in rail have two historic railway in my constituency many historic railway offer public service and would like to continue or grow into do so in future there be an opportunity to harness that enthusiasm and energy but we need to shift the dial on capital investment in public infrastructure hope that be something the government will tackle rapidly because we need capital to make progress call apsana begum congratulate you on your election madam deputy speaker and hon member on deliver their maiden speech today thank you for call to speak in this important debate on the bill which be widely welcome by rail trade union and will ensure that train service will be bring under public ownership as private company exist contract expire many of we have long campaign for the renationalisation of our railway so today mark hopeful turning point for our transport system time and again privatisation have prove to be fail imposition that have result in fare increase fall real wage decline quality of service and crisis after crisis in timetabling at the crux of the privatisation problem have be the pursuit of profit at the expense of the taxpayer railway worker and passenger the negative impact of privatisation be far reach as non profitable railway line be discount fare be raise above affordability or service quality be compromise it be no wonder that distrust of the railway industry be rife and that there have be consistent long term consensus for an integrate publicly own railway compare with privatised railway publicly own railway do not need to be drive to maximise profit through cut or price hike instead publicly own railway enable transparent cost and sustainable funding it mean public investment in rail service and properly staff train and station it mean invest in green transport and create green job that be both socially and economically sustainable it also mean say this as somebody who campaign alongside the rmt against ticket office closure ensure accessibility and reflect the need of diversity of rail user include disabled people and yes public rail investment will aid much need economic growth people be absolutely desperate for material change this government promise to deliver investment public ownership and employment right and the bill before the house today be positive first step towards fully integrate

bellwether trend be confound be over half century ago in when mr heath waltz into downing street with his piano while mr raphael tuck popular constituency mp hold on to the seat of watford for labour but only by vote so the trend be clearly visible at the time in mr john freeman also keep the seat for labour while the conservatives go into government he have be war hero whose wife have to deliver

morris congratulation on your election madam deputy speaker declare an interest as have long association of mutual support and respect with the transport union particularly unite the rmt and aslef and with all the trade union more generally welcome my right hon friend the secretary of state to her new post and congratulate she most sincerely on prioritise the public ownership of our railway from the government first day in office this be really important bill which give and many other on the left of the party hope and faith that this labour government in which we have place our faith will deliver for we have mean to wear my british rail tie because when start work year ago or thereabout my goodness work for british rail in york and scarborough the tie be my treasured possession but it be more elusive than conservative back bencher in public ownership debate just could not find it have spend quite number of year on the transport committee which scrutinise the last government draft rail reform bill welcome the passenger railway services public ownership bill but it be clear to that the franchising model have fail for three decade it be now time to put passenger before private profit by establish great british railways this bill be the first step in take back control number of member have raise point with which agree and will mention they also take this opportunity to mention local issue in my easington constituency the train station in horden and seaham should provide easy access to middlesbrough sunderland and newcastle for employment education and leisure however my constituent often experience unreliable and at time dangerously overcrowded service with the chronic overcrowding meaning that passenger be often leave on the platform or travel in distressingly overcrowded carriage this could easily be solve by run four carriage instead of two especially during peak period when there be predictable demand include on match day when my team sunderland be at home at the stadium of light or when newcastle united be at home at st james park northern rail invariably run only two carriage service at peak time which seem incredible hope northern rail will address this issue believe that run rail under one public entity will save taxpayer money and allow revenue to be reinveste in improve capacity and service frequency both in my constituency and across the country the british public have line the pocket of private shareholder for year over the past seven year private train operating company have pay on average million to shareholder in dividend while take public subsidy under the term of the bill these profit will be reinveste in our railway we have see how lner on the east coast main line have pay more than million to the department for transport since it have be in public ownership under the operator of last resort but this bill will go still far there will be no more hefty management fee and performance bonus to train operating company with more money pay back into great british railways understand the safeguard for open access operator where they add value and capacity in east durham grand central have apply to the office of rail and road for four daily call at seaham station in my constituency which would provide direct connection to london alleviate pressure on the overcrowded route from seaham to sunderland open access operator can benefit the network so hope the orr approve these new service at the early opportunity congratulate the minister on build consensus with those on the frontline who run our railway and note the vocal support for the bill from the rmt and aslef have long campaign with the rmt and aslef for public ownership as the first step towards create an integrated railway that prioritise passenger and our economic wellbeing over and above shareholder dividend the secretary of state be on the right track excuse the pun and while she be on roll urge she to go little far

last year with one in train cancel when train do come they be routinely delay and overcrowded while deliver some of the bad disruption to passenger travel shareholder have extract million in dividend in the last three year those be the condition that passenger in my constituency have be force to accept and come to expect as frequent and frequently frustrated user of the west coast main line do not need figure to know that passenger as well as staff be feed up last week avanti catering staff go on strike over short notice change to their shift pattern job cut and enforce overtime which be cause widespread stress and fatigue this be the late in string of industrial action dispute that have dog avanti which impose excruciating condition on its long suffer staff the last government sit back and watch as the privatisation model fail and staff and customer suffer the consequence blackpool tourism have recover in recent year and we now welcome record number with visitor top the million mark those visitor contribute billion to our local economy and support more than job there be no doubt that more efficient railway service would allow those figure to grow more reduce visitor dependency on car would not only low emission but encourage more overnight stay to blackpool where we struggle to provide significant parking our new tramway between blackpool north station and the promenade tram network mean that people arrive in the town be instantly connect to hotel accommodation right up and down our seafront reliable and affordable service will also allow my constituent to access well opportunity too often blackpool lose its bright and most talented young people to neighbouring city when that should be an easy commute by improve connectivity and end constant cancellation we can end blackpool brain drain and allow people to live an affordable life by the seaside while access well pay work out of town this landmark change to our railway mean that blackpool can increase visitor number and boost its economy and job market by unlock the potential of our railway we can also unlock the potential of our young people in blackpool by give my constituent and visitor the town and the rail service that can they depend on and deserve we can ensure that blackpool will no long feel abandon at the end of the line call my constituency neighbour the shadow minister thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your new role want to begin by pay tribute to the previous rail minister my constituency predecessor huw merriman see at first hand how hard he work with member across the house to deal with their transport issue and have since come to learn how hard he also work as constituency mp it be pleasure to wind up this debate for the opposition and to have sit and listen to another set of accomplished maiden speech across the house we hear speech from the hon member for hertford and stortford josh dean for south ribble mr foster for taunton and wellington mr amos for stevenage kevin bonavia for high peak jon pearce for thornbury and yate claire young for smethwick gurinder josan for birmingham northfield laurence turner for melksham and devizes brian mathew for watford matt turmaine for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for crewe and nantwich connor naismith for shipley anna dixon and for blackpool south chris webb there be excellent speaker all round but will leave it to the minister to pay detailed tribute to member of his party consistent theme be the importance of family which strongly agree with it be slightly surreal to hear my successor in crewe and nantwich pay tribute to and thank he for his kind word sadly be not sure what get wrong because no one there ever ask if have finish school before ask for their vote to continue with the rail pun be sure that he will be worthy successor to in crewe and nantwich rather than just replacement service on the opposition benches it be helpful to hear from the former rail minister my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton she have first hand experience of the recent change to our railway and she explain clearly how this ideological approach be ignore the reality on the ground where the franchise should be the focus of the minister attention she ask where this be lead and note that the secretary of state refer to the work that the government will do on the supply chain other member have relate their concern about roll stock this be the beginning of the end when it come to flourishing rail sector with all sort of people play their part it be clear that we all want to secure well service for passenger alongside value for money for taxpayer whatever our difference we agree on that the question be how we do it the catastrophic impact of the pandemic have force rethink necessary and important one during the pandemic the previous government demonstrate clearly their commitment to the railway and to railway staff provide large amount of public money to keep the railway run and keep railway staff in their job but that period also hasten the decline of the traditional franchise model as we know it passenger journey plummet and while there have be significant recovery travel pattern have change that be why we conduct major review of our railway service and how they operate and suggest change of approach as outline by the shadow secretary of state during her opening speech that change of approach as we hear today be one the new government be take forward in many area but what we also hear today be that they be bring with they not passenger first policy but an ideology first policy their priority be to ban the private sector from operate our main train service of all the thing they say need do and with year of opposition to come up with list of what need do first they have nationalisation even though as the secretary of state say it will not make train ticket cheap or end the strike in fact it be worth read out the complete non commitment on rail fare that labour make in its plan it say it want price keep wherever possible at point that work for both passenger and taxpayer can imagine the civil service pen of sue gray hover over that particular sentence it really be an exemplar of labour modus operandi use lot of word to say absolutely nothing reformed ticket price reform working practice and increased reliability that be what all our constituent want and the consequence of their rush to implement their ideology be that they bring forward this plan without any evidence for why it will deliver any of that thank the shadow minister for give way and compliment he on his staying power during very long debate he talk about fare and affordability can he explain why under the government who have just exit office fare increase on average by each year almost one and half time high than the rate under the previous labour government the challenge that labour now have to face be whether they choose taxpayer or fare payer to meet the burden of the cost of the railway in fact in recent year we keep rail fare rise below inflation and we have yet to hear similar commitment from the government the impact assessment on the policy be very clear about what the government have commit to achieve absolutely nothing it say it in black and white on page specific quantified target for each objective have not be set so clearly that leave we on the conservative benches to hold they to account have number of question that hope the minister can address in his closing remark first what will be the exact timetable for renationalisation we might assume that the government be rush to do this so that they can begin with greater anglia and west midlands train in september but all they have say be that they want all the contract nationalise by october the minister will understand the uncertainty that will create for the sector so can he confirm more detailed plan to the house for make use of the power they be ask for secondly what will be the approach on nationalise term and condition the minister will know there be variety of working practice across the railway network many of they clearly not in the good interest of passenger and taxpayer for example the varied approach on mandatory sunday working where clearly passenger would be well serve by that become standard or annual leave where again passenger would experience less delay and cancellation if driver be require to give reasonable amount of notice will the government introduce standard contract that prioritise the term and condition across the industry that will benefit passenger and taxpayer or will they be let the union dictate standardise contract that put the union first and passenger last thirdly what plan do the minister have to secure increase passenger number by how much and by when we have see huge increase in passenger growth since the introduction of the train operating company what will take the place of contract incentive to secure that growth in future fourthly on modernisation people up and down the country have see the explosion of technology into our workplace but all across the network modernisation be block and frustrate with demand of more money from the union for the introduction of technology what plan do the government have as they directly take over run the railway to ensure that technological innovation can be implement across the network without undue barrier or union demand get in the way fifthly when it come to funding how will they be reallocate the theoretical money save they argue they will save million from management fee reinveste that across track and train would mean in total to increase in the overall annual budget they need to tell we what exactly it be they will be do with that money that be apparently go to radically improve our railway sixthly what be the balance sheet implication the franchising model allow the purchase of new train and other investment to be make with no impact on public debt will labour be add those cost to public debt in future as yet another excuse for their inevitable tax rise finally what be the bill implication direct or indirect for open access operator whatever the government may say be afraid that the implication of their word and action be that they do not want the private sector run train service so be they go to turn their sight on those operator next if they truly believe in what they be do if it be not just design to appease the left wing of their party they will have to justify their own inconsistency it seem pretty clear that this the government political priority be the wrong approach at the wrong time they should be focus on get their union backer to stop frustrating reform of our railway they should be focus on take forward our plan for great british railways they should at the very least be transparent with the public about the implication of this rush plan for fare punctuality and reliability there be consensus in the house that new way of work be need and we have begin the process of bring that forward but labour members be more concerned with re fight the political battle of the and whatever they may say these be the same old idea this be the same old ideology and this be the same old labour party the hon gentleman be present an interesting proposal he have talk of evidence if we look back over the past few year we see that of train operating company run train franchise in this country be government own own not by the uk government but by the government of germany the netherlands and italy be this not dogma to prevent an evidence base build up around the east coast main line franchise provide profit and an income stream let point out to the hon gentleman that we also see an increase of more than in passenger number on our railway and record level of investment if taxpayer in other country want to invest in our railway service welcome that as the shadow secretary of state say in her opening remark we have prove our lack of adherence to ideology by run when necessary number of private sector operator the point that the labour government have to answer be this if they be so concerned about avanti and other private sector operator they have the necessary power and could do that tomorrow if they be so convinced of their ability to sort all this out simply through nationalisation if they be so convinced that avanti performance be one that require they to step in let they do it tomorrow they be not in opposition any more so they can take step to do thing that they criticise we for not do however be afraid that this be the same old labour more government good private sector bad union first passenger last we on this side of the house have see it and hear it all before and we will make sure that everyone know what labour have spend its time focus on and what it have put first when legislate here politic and ideology instead of focus on what will actually make difference to passenger may first congratulate you on your election madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to close the debate with you in the chair it may have escape the notice of opposition members but there be general election and there be reason for the fact that they be sit on that side and we be sit on this side however have enjoy listen to the many maiden speech that have be make today it have be just over two year since make my own maiden speech and find it extremely nerve rack so be greatly impressed and have to say somewhat intimidate by the quality of the speech make today be also grateful to colleague for their consider contribution and will attempt to respond to as many question and concern as possible where have not be able to do so will follow those up with letter let begin by deal with the issue of public ownership accord to the shadow secretary of state the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately we have no proof that it will improve outcome for passenger but that be clearly not the case we know for fact that this bill will save ten of million of pound in fee and if that be not good start do not know what be furthermore as the secretary of state explain early this reform be base on solid evidence in fact the public sector have an incredibly strong record of successful delivery include increase reliability even when deal with operator that be previously fail financially or otherwise fail to deliver for passenger be confident that public ownership will provide the right foundation to drive forward improvement for passenger be it simplify the arcane fare system integrate rail with other transport or improve accessibility first and foremost it will deliver the standard of reliability that the travel public have every right to expect remind the house that this be one of two bills and that the second will deliver the government wide plan for rail as my hon friend the member for luton south and south bedfordshire rachel hopkins say those wide plan be absolutely design to put passenger back at the heart of the railway and will introduce new measure to protect their interest let assure the shadow secretary of state that the wide railway bill be absolutely priority for this government unlike the previous government who have year to bring forward legislation to reform the railway and only get as far as draft bill we be not delay rather we be take the time to develop the much large bill properly so that it deliver the benefit that we have promise look forward to bring it before the house later in this session when parliamentary time allow under that bill the secretary of state will be the passenger in chief and hold great british railways to account for deliver for passenger and freight we will also create powerful passenger focus watchdog the passenger standards authority to independently monitor standard and champion improvement in service performance against range of measure be glad that the issue of freight have be raise today alongside the overall growth target set by the secretary of state the wide railway bill will include statutory duty on great british rail to promote the use of rail freight to ensure that freight remain key priority my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald be absolutely right to say that it be shameful that the previous government approach to industrial relation be failure which inflict two year of disruption and misery on million of passenger by contrast this government will work with union to mediate dispute in her first week in office my right hon friend the secretary of state have meet representative of the relevant union my hon friend the member for hertford and stortford josh dean in an excellent maiden speech raise very important point about staff shortage on our railway that be result of the previous government failure to plan properly for the future lead to skill and recruitment gap it be of course important that the right staff with the right skill be in the right place at the right time to provide the level of service that passenger expect and deserve my ministerial colleague and look forward to work with train operator and trade union on this issue wish my hon friend well in his endeavour to bring more young people into politic something we should all be passionate about on ticket fare share the shadow secretary of state ambition for low fare for all passenger we be take pragmatic step towards that and be commit to review the overly complicated fare system with view to simplify it and introduce digital innovation we will explore the option for expand ticket innovation such as digital pay as you go and digital season ticket across the network we be aware that increase passenger number be critical to this plan and that be what our simplified system will aim to do the shadow secretary of state and the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan raise concern about the ideology of our approach can assure they that our plan be not return to the day of british rail and that our approach be not ideological it be pragmatic we will take the good lesson from the public and private operation of railway it be about make sure that the system be right with check and balance growth incentive and proper accountability we have be clear that our approach mean relentless focus on the interest of passenger and the taxpayer above all else the same apply to the shadow secretary of state claim that the government plan be about put politician in charge which could not be further from the truth the point of great british railways be to get day to day decision out of the hand of politician and into the hand of those who be well place to make such decision with the need of the passenger and the freight user at the heart of the whole system the shadow secretary of state mention the chancellor statement the chancellor have make some very hard decision on the basis of the dire financial situation that we have inherit from the previous government but this do not change the fact that provide well transport for our citizen be an absolute priority and we will not waver in our pursuit of well rail service for all also thank the hon member for bath wera hobhouse for her comment and share her view that intervention be need however let assure she that we be well aware that this can not come at the expense of other vital service assure she that our plan to fix britain railway be fully cost and will be deliver within our fiscal rule it will improve service and reduce cost to the public purse the hon member for bath and for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter and my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris also highlight the role of the rolling stock leasing company this be another area where the government approach be pragmatic deliver value for the taxpayer and not drive by ideology it would not be responsible to spend billion of pound of taxpayer money buy up exist rolling stock especially when as my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer have set out this afternoon we face billion black hole in the public finance create by the conservatives completely agree with the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton on the importance of rail link to local community and welcome her constructive attitude to this debate deeply sympathise with the point she make and those make by the hon member for didcot and wantage olly glover my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker and other about the avanti west coast service as my right hon friend the secretary of state set out she have already meet with avanti to make her expectation clear however the right hon member for aldridge brownhills will appreciate the need to bring service into public ownership as exist contract expire to avoid the need to pay penny in compensation to the operator for early termination that do not change the fact that the government care deeply about performance and will hold private operating company to account for the remainder of their contract to reassure my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson will also highlight that contract can be terminate early if the relevant contractual condition be meet and we will not hesitate to do so if need she also raise the important issue of ticket office closure as do the hon member for taunton and wellington mr amos in his excellent maiden speech confirm that this government have no plan to close ticket office the right hon member for aldridge brownhills and the hon member for bexhill and battle also ask about open access service we have be clear that there will remain role for open access service with exist operator continue to operate on the network alongside publicly own service where they add value and capacity to the network finally the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry highlight the role of transport for london and merseytravel how to secure the delivery of service in those area will remain matter for local leader the wide railway bill will give local leader statutory role in governing manage plan and develop the rail network this along with our plan to give local authority more control over bus service through our well bus bill will make it more straightforward to integrate the railway with other form of transport would like to thank hon member again for an excellent and consider debate on this cinderella topic as the hon member for didcot and wantage call it and welcome far engagement from both side of the house as the bill progress with that madam deputy speaker commend the bill to the house question put that the

kitchen thank you madam deputy speaker for grant this important debate on the interruption apparently other member of the house do not have the courtesy to allow we to debate the importance of this road but hope they will clear the chamber with the decency that this important topic deserve the be know more commonly as simply the great north road it be one of britain old road trace its history back to ad and the roman occupation romans saxons vikings english and scottish kings cavaliers and roundhead have all march its length even the notorious highwayman dick turpin ply his trade along the road take shelter at inn in rutland stilton still culinary staple in our little part of the world be sell to hungry traveller as they travel up and down the road we would struggle to write history of britain without the great north road and it remain as significant today as ever albeit with less evocative name thank to the department for transport the run mile from london to edinburgh it be the long road in our country and vital link for commerce freight and of course people each day an average of vehicle pass along it thousand rely on it it connect we with felixstowe grimsby and even dover via the at the northern end of the corridor we have the humber port handle billion worth of good per annum form vital part of british and international supply chain heavy good vehicle make up of all vehicle go along the corridor more than double the national average all that leave we in no doubt that the be the beat heart of our transport network it be also vital connection for the rural community of rutland leicestershire and lincolnshire that serve it be on their behalf that have secure this debate as we see worrying proliferation in road accident all too often fatal along our stretch of this ancient road the department for transport datum unfortunately demonstrate that proliferation in there be crash on the more than the and more than the in the last five year there have be closure the majority due to accident that average out as an accident every two week but unfortunately in the few week lead up to this debate we have see four serious accident include one tragic death and three people seriously injure each accident normally result in closure of up to hour with hgv be divert through our very small and picturesque village while some area of the rank highly on the safety index the dual carriageway between peterborough and blyth which pass through rutland and stamford have serious issue characterise by substandard central reservation crossing substandard junction and dangerously short slip lane which see driver such as stop on the slip road almost every single day we have road that be little more than dirt track that join the high hgv number and lack of sign technology sos telephone variable message sign and even cctv the run through my constituency but the same issue also apply to the new with similar dangerous junction the mile section that include the stretch between keyston and ellington have both crossover and ungraded junction do my hon friend agree that on those stretch highways england should introduce reduce speed limit of mph where there be dangerous junction as there be on the as an immediate measure prior to upgrade the junction and improve signage as my hon friend say that be something we have on the already caution he because know that while our constituent call for safety measure they be often not the big fan of slow speed however as short term interim step until we can get those long term safety issue resolve he be absolutely right to stand up for they on behalf of his constituent when it come to my constituent transport for the east midlands do survey of more than local resident some report feeling actively unsafe while drive on the and more than report have either be in an accident or see one that be half the people survey in my constituency who see that it be an extraordinary number and it speak for itself about the urgent safety upgrade need that be only enhance when do my own survey of resident on the of the hundred and hundred who respond more than say that close the central reservation gap be key and over separately mention the slip road be serious concern for they have be ask national highways for urgent action for several year be glad that its representative have agree to come and drive the with they may soon regret that decision but they have agree to do so be also pleased that few week before the election they agree to and announce review of central reservation crossing on the it be my no request to they so be delighted to have secure it will the hon lady give way absolutely in fact it might mean that finally make twitter this evening commend the hon lady for bring this forward she always bring important issue to this chamber as she do to westminster hall understand that this morning bbc camera crew film collision between two car while prepare news report about road safety on the road that she refer to that illustrate that rural road need more attention the news report remind of my strangford constituency where ballyatwood be very similar to the lincolnshire road this be about new improved road signage warning post and well line in the road do she agree that often rural road fall behind urban road and that there be need to prioritise funding for rural road my hon friend be absolutely right and will turn to potential solution that plan to put to the government on that exact point but be it not horrify that my local bbc go out to film on the and within minute they film an accident want to see the review of central reservation conduct quickly and commitment from the government to invest in whatever recommendation be bring forward be pleased that last year secure five safety upgrade to the in my stretch that we have see those put in place and that they have make difference but write again to the new secretary of state request meeting to discuss the on the first day back be still await her response but hope that the government will in turn get use to reply to back benchers when we write to they appreciate that the government be in their infancy therefore have some complex but in some way straightforward recommendation to make to they on the road network the first relate to the point that my hon friend the member for strangford make about population index the community represent be overwhelmingly rural represent hundred and hundred of village currently the national highways criterion for safety upgrade be base on the total number of fatality that occur in the area which result in these awful statement from resident such as how many people have to die before something happen or do someone have to die before there be action the problem with that system be that it ignore the low population density of rural community such as yours madam deputy speaker if an area have dangerous junction or junction where there be high number of accident in highly populated area the number of accident will be high therefore we need to take into account low population density so that when we understand the number of fatality and accident that take place the rurality do not play against the area and reduce the amount of support receive we need new funding formula would like to ask for rural population road index where essentially the fatality be consider per head of population and rurality to allow fairness to come into system rather than urban area always get investment because they have high overall number of fatality we also need improvement to specific junction in the long term colsterworth great ponton and the many stamford junction all need remedial work but know that that be difficult national highways have say that if the be build now the slip road we have in our area would never be give permission to go ahead because they be that short congratulate the hon lady on secure this debate and on the excellent work she have be do in her constituency to successfully get modification make on her stretch of the she have refer rightly to the importance of physical change to make these road safe and there be more people kill and seriously injure on rural road than in urban area such as my constituency do she not agree that the work that some local authority have be do over the year to address driver behaviour have also be important in address dangerous driving and change drive behaviour particularly at night and among young people that be another way of address some of these issue as well as look at physical change to the road layout yes there be no doubt that unfortunately driver behaviour be normally at the heart of accident it be very difficult to identify genuinely dangerous road have sit down and look at the datum with the police and unfortunately even though we have some genuinely dangerous road my team will not drive on bit of the because they believe they to be that dangerous the majority of accident in my constituency involve someone on their phone eat food do their make up or be distract in some other way we absolutely need to continue address driver behaviour one of the simple measure that ask the government to bring forward would be low cost and immediate and would benefit our community across the country there be currently no bespoke sign to warn of short slip road ahead anywhere in our country and it would be transformational for community such as mine if we be to introduce new dedicated sign while do the school run with my son have to stop on slip road every single day it be not possible to continue drive because of the heavy good vehicle and because of how short those slip road be so ask the minister to consider create such sign of course would ask for it to be trialle in rutland and stamford but think that trial would prove that such sign would make big difference hope the minister can understand my frustration that when put in write question on improvement to the the department for transport respond that national highways have complete number of safety improvement to the in recent year obviously be aware of those upgrade have secure they the question be more about what be plan for the year to come but know that new government need time to get into place and come up with those plan while those safety improvement have make difference we need more plan for what we could do go forward because the be such key route between london and edinburgh conduit for commerce freight and people short slip road dangerous central reservation and poorly design junction put my community at risk every single day therefore will briefly reiterate my request and sincerely hope the minister will work with to achieve they as mention the first be new road sign to warn of short slip road ahead and encourage traffic to move briefly into the right hand lane also ask the government to commit to deliver the conclusion of national highways central reservation review when that work be complete which will benefit hundred of constituency up and down the country in the long term ask they to commit to safety upgrade to junction of particular concern along the and to change the formula for how national highways direct safety investment to consider fatality per capita rather than in total to reflect low population density area of course the minister be very welcome although have hear all of this doubt she will take up this offer to come and drive the slip road and central reservation crossing with herself great ponton be really quite something not week go by when do not receive news alert about serious accident on the every time my heart pause and have to hope it be not fatality that be how severe the accident be with my son school there of course also first question who it be and whether know the person involve genuinely believe the measure have describe could make big difference to save life solve the problem of the be the no ask of my resident hope have give mix of low cost immediate solution that could be bring in of course the long term solution would make tangible difference but those immediate solution would also make difference they would save life and would be very grateful if the minister would consider work with on this issue over the long term that be very powerful contribution on behalf of rutland and stamford call the minister thank you madam deputy speaker and add my congratulation on your election it be pleasure to respond to the important point raise by the hon member for rutland and

on many occasion on the section of the she refer to and have some understanding and appreciation of the issue she raise safety on our road be of the utmost importance which be why the government have announce that they intend to publish new road safety strategy the first in over decade that work be already under way and look forward to share further detail with the house in due course and engage with member from across the house as we develop that strategy this be the second debate that the hon member have secure on this subject she be undoubtedly strong advocate for her constituent and for road user campaign extensively for improvement to this vital section of national infrastructure and to protect the safety of everyone who use it our strategic road network be the backbone of the country economy with mile of motorway and major road it connect people build community create opportunity and be catalyst for the uk economy although it make up only of england overall road network it be the most heavily used and carry one third of all traffic and two third of all freight investment in our strategic road network be through the road investment strategy process which have lead to billion be invest between and and more than billion be invest between and the road investment strategy focus on create road network that be safe accessible and reliable for all road user and that address its impact on all those who use it we be commit to put transport at the heart of mission drive government by transform infrastructure to work for the whole country to unlock growth promote social mobility tackle regional inequality and support the transition to net zero economy as the hon member for rutland and stamford set out at mile the be the long trunk road in the uk it connect the two capital of london and edinburgh and all the community along its length it be one of the most recognisable route on the network and play vital role in support our nation economy with that integral role for business and motorist come the challenge of balance the strategic role of the road with local journey and the impact of the road on local community such as those that she represent the mile section of the between peterborough and blyth carry to vehicle every single day as the hon member say and nearly quarter of those be heavy good vehicle which be well above the average for similar sized road much have already be do to improve performance include modernise junction and improve road alignment but recognise that the route still have its challenge the number of collision particularly fatal collision be high than the national average for an equivalent road as she say which demand examination and action that be why national highways continue to invest significant sum into that section of the to improve its safety performance that investment have see number of immediate safety focus improvement at key section and junction such as enhance lighting and improve road marking and signage at specific location along the route be pleased to hear that the hon member recently meet representative from national highways to discuss the key issue on this route be aware they will be arrange visit soon to discuss the issue in more detail will ensure that my official be inform of the specific outcome of that meeting and look forward to receive that feedback congratulate the minister on her appointment it be great pleasure to see she at the dispatch box she talk about bring in the road safety strategy be not sure whether that be the same as the long await strategic framework for road safety that be ask about previously national highways have commitment to think about active travel people walk and cycling for new junction particularly across junction but also along some stretch give the way that the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns describe the can see that nobody would want to cycle along it but ask the minister to consider incorporate active travel into the thinking for the new road safety strategy on major highway my hon friend be an absolutely marvellous advocate for the benefit of active travel and the thing we need to do to make it safe for pedestrian and cyclist recognise her point completely recently have to make hasty dash while out walk across major trunk road and the point she make be really important we do need to look at how we ensure that pedestrian cyclist and indeed horse rider be able to cross our major trunk road network safely will also seek further information on the potential for signage relate to short slip road as the hon member for rutland and stamford ask improve the safety of all road user will always be one of my high priority as have say this government be commit to reduce the number of death and serious injury on our road they ruin the life of too many people and their wide family but as road user we all have vital role to play would like to take this opportunity at the dispatch box to remind everyone who be watch or listen of the fatal four tragically most death and serious injury on our road be not the result of accident the cause be well know speeding use mobile phone behind the wheel not wear seatbelt and drive under the influence of drink or drug everyone take to our road should remember this before get behind the wheel england motorway and major road be some of the safe in the world but the long term ambition of national highways remain that no one should be harm while travel or work on its network road safety be shared responsibility and it be important that we all recognise the part we can play as it can not be achieve in isolation national highways be continue its work with key partner organisation and road user to help we collectively reduce the number of death and serious injury on our strategic road want to thank the hon lady once again not only for secure this debate and for the important point she raise which look forward to discuss far but for her extensive work to bring together regional partner to push for improvement want to reassure she that take this matter seriously and intend to continue this conversation to see what we can achieve to provide positive outcome for road user in the short and long term question put and agree to house adjourn
