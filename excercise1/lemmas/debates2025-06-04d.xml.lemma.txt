oil and gas activity as direct result of labour ideological job loss every two week steep decline in skilled role nowhere for supply chain job to go but overseas and decline in the workforce of why because of massive investor uncertainty due to negative sentiment around oil and gas as result of the ban on licence and the epl extension when will the secretary of state and the scottish labour party grow backbone stand up to the secretary of state for energy security and net zero and stand up for scotland and scottish worker do not know whether the hon member agree with net zero anymore

concerned about the financial difficulty face by several of they as the hon lady will know high education be devolved matter and scotland university their staff and their student all need scottish

economy but so be tourism can the minister enlighten about the jet safari trip from clacton to scotland that have take place allow former banker to patronise the local miss the big picture and be back in england for pint of warm beer by lunchtime think do hear something about the hon member for clacton nigel farage get lose in hamilton this weekend and sculke behind the bin before he be send pack

and reform school standards what discussion he have have with the scottish government on school standard the right hon gentleman will have hear remind the house on number of occasion that john swinney say that education be the defining mission of his snp government but early this year we get the news that standard of attainment in scotland school be decline across the board and shamefully outcome for young working class kid be get bad the attainment gap be widen the scottish government have fail generation they can not be allow third decade in power to continue that damage scotland teacher parent and pupil all deserve well standard in our school what have cause the system which be once the benchmark for all other to become such disappointment there be simple answer to that question the snp scottish government when my right hon friend discuss with snp ministers through announcement make this week the huge employment opportunity that this government have create for young people in scotland will he impress on they the urgent need to finally tackle the persistent and in some area widen attainment gap face by pupil from poor background not only in fife but in south lanarkshire these concern be often raise by resident of hamilton larkhall and stonehouse the house may not know that last year pupil leave high school in scotland without single qualification to their name and one in six scot be not in education employment or training that be the legacy of the snp scottish government what have they do about job and growth they be against the defence industry and against the trade deal with the eu india and the us they be against young scot in scotland economic co operation scotland and northern ireland what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for northern ireland on improve economic co operation between scotland and northern ireland our recent trade deal with the united states india and the eu will improve access to vital market for business in both scotland and northern ireland these be deal with the most populous country in the world the rich country in the world and our most important trading partner recognise the importance of economic co operation between northern ireland and scotland indeed early this week meet the hon member for south antrim robin swann and local business to discuss exactly this issue will the minister set up meeting with the secretary of state for northern ireland to consider create trade fair focus on trade between northern ireland business and scottish business that would create network would possibly create job and would be great for the economy in both northern ireland and scotland it would certainly go down well with business in north down and right across the uk would be delighted to see more trade between scotland and northern ireland will happily meet colleague in the northern ireland office to explore that scotland and northern ireland be set to benefit from the government trio of trade deal do the minister agree that it be astonishing that the snp stand with the tories and reform against an eu trade deal that be good for scotland and that after almost year in government the snp have no plan for scotland one in six scot be on an nhs waiting list ayrshire ferry be late and be cost billion one in six scot be not in education employment or training and the snp have no plan for the defence of our union agree with my hon friend that it be astonishing that we see range on the opposition benches numerous people who have talk down the potential of scotland exporter and who have say that there be no benefit to be have from these deal for scottish business sector that be desperate to grow and export and be delighted with the three trade deal which will make such difference to they call the shadow secretary of state for year there have be under investment in scotland road the and be all in dire need of upgrading or dualling work on all of they have be delay or even cancel by the snp in the spirit of improve economic co operation between the nation of the uk and specifically between scotland and northern ireland and give how vital the and be to individual business and haulier will the minister seek the ringfencing of the barnett consequential that will arise as result of this morning announcement by the chancellor so that the snp must spend that money on improve road in

business on the high street we be invest million in our plan for neighbourhood in scotland with million worth of funding for town include irvine greenock kilmarnock coatbridge clydebank elgin dumfries arbroath peterhead and kirkwall of course it would help if the scottish government extend business rate relief to retail and leisure business as have happen south of the border many business in scotland be ask where that money go do the secretary of state agree that it be astonishing that the snp vote against the million to regenerate hamilton town centre and that only labour davy russell will stand up for local people job and service have bring glass to see if can find an ounce of credibility in the snp candidate in hamilton for vote against that million the snp candidate be councillor from cambuslang who stand for election twice in rutherglen seek selection in shettleston and then vote against million for the hamilton town centre before seek selection there in scotland

grangemouth type shutdown every two week how many job have to be lose in my constituency for his government to act the leader of the snp in this house vote against the setting up of great british energy in his constituency which be create job in scotland he be against the eu trade deal he be against the us trade deal he be against the india trade deal he be bad for job and should go town and village across north east scotland such as aberdeen and inverurie kintore and ellon in my constituency will all need regenerate in future if the secretary of state government keep decimate the oil and gas sector the good thing his government can do for the north east of scotland be allow new licence and cut the increase to the energy profit levy will he commit to that otherwise more and more money will need to be put into north east scotland to regenerate our town in future this government be put money into scottish town to regenerate they as we keep say from this dispatch box oil and gas will be with we for decade to come the industry itself be make the transition and we have to make sure that it happen and happen for the benefit of worker in the north east and all over scotland be not even sure however that it be transition that the hon lady and the conservative party now back nhs funding barnett formula what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on the impact of the barnett formula on level of funding for the nhs in scotland follow the spring statement it be confirm that the block grant for scotland this year be record billion that be no thank to the snp and reform which both vote against that massive funding boost for scotland and want to scrap the barnett formula that deliver it despite that record funding the snp still have no plan to get waiting list down when one in six scot be stick on an nhs waiting list and the educational attainment gap be grow by the day despite the record funding provide by the labour government the snp plan to downgrade the neonatal intensive care unit at university hospital wishaw which could force the family of sick baby to travel as far as aberdeen for treatment and support do the secretary of state agree that the snp cut should be reverse as the father of an week old daughter be absolutely horrify by those proposal and know that they will be cause anxiety for family across lanarkshire that be why it be so disappointing to see the snp candidate in the hamilton by election back the plan to downgrade the wishaw neonatal unit the way to send message to the snp that that be unacceptable be to vote for davy russell tomorrow in the hamilton larkhall and stonehouse by election local authority funding barnett formula what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on the impact of the barnett formula on level of funding for local authority the chancellor autumn budget deliver the big settlement in the history of devolution for the scottish billion want to see that cash reach the frontline service that have suffer year of cut under the snp that record settlement be possible only because of the barnett formula something oppose not only by the scottish nationalist but by the hon member for clacton nigel farage whose reform circus be send pack from hamilton this week the large ever devolution billion be great news for scotland and its local authority but under the snp there be case on nhs waiting list this affect people in my constituency in north northumberland many of whom use cross border healthcare and dental service so do the minister agree that the snp need to sort itself out and start deliver change to the nhs as labour be do in england could not agree more in england waiting list have fall since labour come to office less than year ago while in scotland they continue to rise and we now see nearly one in six scot wait for treatment john swinney have in total desperation announce that the snp government fifth nhs recovery plan in less than

opposition three week ago the winter fuel policy be set in stone two week ago the prime minister turn today the chancellor be rush her plan because she just realise when winter be so on the behalf of the pensioner who want to know can the prime minister be clear with we here and now how many of the million people who lose their winter fuel payment will get it back well be glad to see the right hon lady be catch up with what happen two week ago at the budget we take the right decision to stabilise the economy because of the billion black hole that the conservatives leave we take the right decision and the growth figure be up interest rate have be cut and we have free trade deal so we will look again as say two week ago at the eligibility for winter fuel and of course we will set out how we pay for it but because we have stabilise the economy we on this side be commit to the triple lock and that increase pension by over this april the conservatives say the triple lock be unsustainable think her position be that she want to means test it the prime minister clearly have selective amnesia ask he three question about the winter fuel payment two week ago and he be flounder the fact be he have not answer the question ask he he can not tell we who will get the payment all we see be turn after turn his head must be spin will he apologise now include to his own back benchers for take the payment away in the first place can he tell we how he will pay for this we take the right decision at the budget because we need to stabilise the economy the right hon lady need to apologise for the fact that the conservatives leave the economy in terrible state with mini budget that blow up the economy and we be leave with billion black hole when she get up perhaps she should apologise for that the office for budget responsibility have say there be no such black hole the prime minister have just give away billion for the chagos island that be his black hole he have not stabilise the economy borrowing price be high now than at any time in the last parliament he have not stabilise the economy he have no clear answer on what he be do it be just chaos chaos chaos he keep make announcement with no detail let move to another area of confusion can we get simple answer will the government keep the two child benefit cap be absolutely determined that we will drive down child poverty that be one of the proud thing of the last labour government that be why we have taskforce and that be why we have strategy and we will set out that strategy in due course but we drive child poverty down under the conservatives poverty always go up do not ask the prime minister about taskforce ask he if he will keep the two child benefit cap and he do not know it be just chaos and uncertainty he have no detail he be brief something and cause lot of confusion to the people out there on that two child benefit cap tell he this believe in family but also believe in fairness on the conservative side of the house we believe that people on benefit should have to make the same choice on have child as everyone else what do the prime minister believe believe profoundly in drive down poverty and child poverty that be why we will put strategy in place but the right hon lady talk about head spin there be only one leader who be praise this week by the russian embassy if she carry on echo kremlin talk point like this reform will be send she an application form for membership ask the prime minister what he believe in he have to look in his folder to find the answer his mps behind he know what they believe in he do not know he have be in government for nearly year it will only get hard and hard the can forced laughter the plant question all that will disappear because at every single point thing be get bad he have to ask morgan mcsweeney what it be that he believe in but the fact be that chaos be be feel in the economy the chancellor say she would not be come back with new tax rise but she will have to pay for all these turn she be announce out there will she be go to look in my folder because here have the quote that the right hon lady say on sky will read it thank you laughter it be what the leader of the opposition say it be worth listen to she say israel be fight proxy war on behalf of the uk just like ukraine be on behalf of western europe against russia well that be certainly notice in the russian embassy because they put out statement say that the leader of the opposition have finally call spade spade it say ukraine be indeed fight proxy war against russia on behalf of western interest it go on to say the illegitimate kyiv regime create finance and arm by the west have be at it since so they they want the detail have give the quote that be what russia say in response she ask what believe in believe in stand by ukraine and call out russia as the aggressor it be our government that stand behind ukraine and lead the way in europe everything the prime minister have say this afternoon be total nonsense obfuscation and avoid the question he do not have any answer it be disgraceful ask the prime minister about the two child benefit cap he be talk about the kremlin he be say everything he can to distract from the mess he be make of our economy the oecd have downgrade growth for the next two year he can not rule out tax rise police chief be say that they do not have the money they need to keep the public safe just as he be release more criminal on to the street his cabinet be squabble with each other and they say that they have lose control of the border but he still manage to find billion to give away the chagos island this be total and utter chaos two week ago he be crow about his historic trade deal and how he get zero per cent tariff on steel now the steel industry will face tariff unless he do exactly what president trump tell he to it be chaos chaos chaos and be the root of the chaos that it be about this prime minister his decision and his judgment the only she get up on wednesday morning scroll through social medium and never do any of the detail we be the only country in the world that be not pay the tax on steel and we be work on the rest that will be come down we be work to bring it down to zero that be go to happen interruption order please let we listen to the answer even if you do not believe you be get one it be how the prime minister wish to do it she oppose the us deal she oppose the india deal she oppose what we be do with the eu and she oppose diego garcia that be vital intelligence and strategic capability and it be absolutely clear that legal uncertainty would compromise that capability in very short time no responsible prime minister would ever let that happen we have secure the long term basis for the base that have be welcome by the us nato australia new zealand and india they be our ally it have be oppose by our adversary russia china and iran and into that column we have reform presumably follow putin and the tories follow reform anyone who see the six year old girl flee the flame shelter where her family be kill by an israeli air strike will carry those horrific image with they forever these be very dark day gaza be stain on the soul of humanity and it be further shame that there be more moral clarity come from ms rachel on youtube than from many world leader who be complicit in silence the prime minister say this week that britain must be ready for war ask after ten of thousand of death after generation of gazans stunt by hunger and trauma when will it be ready for peace when will it help to stop this genocide when will it hold the israeli government to account and when will it recognise the state of palestine be grateful to the hon member for raise this she be absolutely right to describe these as dark day israel recent action be appal and in my view counterproductive and intolerable we have strongly oppose the expansion of military operation and settler violence and the blocking of humanitarian aid the house will have see that we have suspend the free trade agreement talk and sanction extremist support violence in the west bank we will keep look at further action along with our ally include sanction but let be absolutely clear we need to get back to ceasefire we need the hostage who have be hold for very long time to be release and we desperately need more aid at speed and at volume into gaza because it be an appalling and intolerable situation call the leader of the liberal democrats start by welcome report that the chancellor will give winter fuel payment to more pensioner this winter although because we still await the detail we will reserve our full judgment recognise the effort of the prime minister to pull out all the stop to avoid president trump damage tariff letter from the king offer to water down online safety law and even try to send the open to one of trump golf course the prime minister think he have secure tariff for british steel but now trump be threaten we with unless we comply with his new five week deadline this be classic trump change the term of deal he have already agree do the prime minister share my fear that nothing will stop trump mess the uk around short of bung few hundred million pound into his trumpcoin we have deal and we be implement it within very short time be very confident that we will get those tariff down in accordance with the deal will come back to the right hon gentleman and update the house in due course and think the house will be very pleased at the from sedentary position the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie say no this be zero tariff on steel interruption let we come back to this in couple of week when we have implement it but the conservative obviously do not want it labour have back steel the conservatives laugh at attempt to do so that be big part of the problem have hop the prime minister would now be begin to see the sort of man trump be and start get tough on he so we will come back to this issue welcome the prime minister remark about gaza because be sure that all of we be appal by the late scene starve people desperate for food water and medicine meet with chaos and violence the us israeli programme be clearly fail and nothing short of lift the full blockade on aid will do give that the netanyahu government refuse to do that will the prime minister take more decisive action today will he push at the united nations security council for humanitarian corridor to get the desperately need aid urgently into gaza give the right hon gentleman my assurance because this be very important issue that we be work at pace with our ally on that very issue to take whatever measure we can to get that humanitarian aid in we have be do that intensively over recent week and give he my assurance that we will continue to do that because that aid need to get in at speed and at volume and he be

therapeutic horticultural centre support adult with mental health problem like similar community mental health service across scotland it be now under threat it face potential closure due to chronic underfunding of integrated joint board by the snp government do the prime minister agree that facility such as redhall wall garden should have be priority for the snp when decide how to spend the record funding settlement that scottish labour mps win for scotland what my hon friend describe be how health service in scotland be utterly break under the snp whether it be people wait too long for mental health support in his constituency or the wishaw neonatal unit in hamilton which the snp be threaten to downgrade in the snp government say they would recruit more community mental health

labour government bring waiting list down to record low and they drive they up to record high the last labour government have the high possible confidence in the nhs and they drag it down to the low ever level because of the money that we be put in we have do million extra appointment in the first year of labour government that be the difference that labour make in power the environment agency predict that million home one in four in england could be at risk of flooding by despite this the conservative party preside over tripling of the proportion of our flood defence that be deem not adequate by contrast this labour government be invest over billion in new flood defence include on the greenway in my hendon constituency do the prime minister agree that it be shame that not all party share this government determination to keep home safe from flooding thank my hon friend for highlight this issue because the conservatives leave our flood defence in the bad state on record it

institutional miscarriage of justice will he instruct the ministry of justice to review this matter and pay personal attention to get this travesty of justice resolve the right hon member raise really

office be deliver country that people will see be be set up for success that they can take part in that be the change we promise and that be the change this labour government be deliver commend this statement to the house think you miss couple of railway station out of your statement minister but not to worry call the shadow chief secretary to the treasury thank the chief secretary to the treasury for his statement and for early sight of it will start with an area of agreement it be shared ambition to enable all part of this country to participate in our growth and our future potential in the united kingdom be everywhere and it be right that the government seek to unlock it with every mean they have indeed that be one of the guide principle of the conservative administration levelling up policy they always say that imitation be the sincere form of flattery now we know that this chancellor have reputation for copying so think would have look at the statement make in on network north allocation which be sure the chief secretary have see think would compare those allocation with the government announcement today have the conservative announcement in one hand and the labour announcement in the other interruption labour member can shout all they want here we go in the conservatives promise the west midland say to labour members that the chief secretary be also only make promise in we promise billion for the west midland and the government have announce billion for the west midland today we promise billion for west yorkshire today the government have announce billion we promise billion for greater manchester they have announce billion today we promise billion for south yorkshire they have announce billion today we promise billion for liverpool they have announce billion today we promise billion for the north east they have announce billion today we promise billion for the west of england they have announce billion today we promise million for tees valley in and labour have announce billion today know the chief secretary be occasionally good with number but do he not agree that what he be announce today be essentially nothing more than rounding error on the conservatives plan from the only difference between the and announcement be that we would have spell rotherham correctly in our announcement the truth be the chancellor will go around the country rewrite history as frequently as she write her cv but nobody believe in her billion black hole what people do believe be that this chancellor be open to change she be go to roll back the issue on the winter fuel allowance her botched welfare reform and change to the two child policy look at those on the treasury bench they have not get spine if labour back benchers have an issue in their constituency and want to stand up for their constituent they should make bid to this chief secretary because he will back down and give they the money that be what we know from labour we also know that in the government analysis of the green book they be look to change the assessment of the cost benefit analysis my question to the chief secretary therefore do have number of question first will he publish the cost benefit ratio for each of the project he have announce today will he state whether they have be evaluate on the exist green book rule or on new rule will he give an indication today of what those rule might be secondly as the labour government try to decide whether their commitment on defence be for or of gdp with both those number and today investment stretch into the next period of government whoever be in government can the chief secretary confirm that it be this government intention that the investment make today will be secure whatever the change make on defence expenditure the chief secretary say that he be able to make this announcement because the government change the rule which have enable billion more of investment but that be not quite right be it the government can afford the additional investment only if people be prepared to fund it and there be two source for funding taxpayer or the bond market can the chief secretary therefore advise whether he be go to look for additional funding from taxis or additional borrowing if there be shortfall the truth be despite what the back benchers say this labour treasury team be out of their depth they be addict to tax increase and to more borrowing the chief secretary can republish as many press release as he like but we know that because of their reckless mismanagement of the economy come the autumn this labour government will be back for more be pleased to see the shadow chief secretary to the treasury back in his place today always enjoy our exchange welcome the fact that he support our plan and see the good value in they will respond to one particular question and then answer the rest in the round all the green book detail will be publish next week at the spending review so we will be able to share they with he and the house at that time the shadow chief secretary say that we be imitate the conservative party promise to level up the country but think the british people vote and give their verdict on the conservatives success in deliver that at the last election whereas their version of level up be set of false promise this labour government be deliver real change the shadow chief secretary rightly give his role ask how we will fund the announcement we have make today as explain in my statement to the house it be because of the chancellor decision to amend the fiscal rule and invest in britain instead of continue with decline that we have be able to do so the shadow chief secretary and the conservative party have not say what they would do differently they be against the change in the fiscal rule against our increase of taxis on the wealthy people at the budget and against every single measure we have take to be able to pay for today announcement whether it be the conservatives reform or any other party they need to recognise that the conservatives false promise lead to their decline and their unfunded promise be disrespectful to the british people and that this labour government promise change at the election and we be deliver it these be fully fund promise unlike the unfunded promise of the conservatives which pose risk to the economy and risk to family finance the soon the conservatives learn from their lesson apologise to the british people and come forward with some serious proposal the well for the debate in this house call the chair of the treasury committee warmly welcome this investment in britain and hope that the treasury will be fully evaluate the impact of this vital transport infrastructure on growth in region which we know have always lag except for in london and the south east although these figure be fully fund now with all the global shock we be see it be important that we be aware that there could be additional cost on some of the raw material be use and any delay obviously add cost too will the chief secretary tell the house the government plan if cost do go higher will the figure be fully fund regardless or will they have to go back to the drawing board if there be challenge my hon friend the chair of the treasury committee rightly allude to the fact that the chancellor speech today make the case for this government invest in every part of the country and ensure that growth be feel widely my hon friend ask about the supply chain and cost for build infrastructure the house will know that britain have unfortunately become country where most of our infrastructure project go over time and over budget as failure of poor industrial and infrastructure policy and erratic decision make over many many year alongside the spending review we will be publish the infrastructure strategy at slightly later stage and that will answer many of my hon friend question on government policy recognise the problem she have raise and the solution that will be set out to support the supply chain to be able to deliver for britain call the liberal democrat spokesperson we liberal democrats believe that when the economy be grow every nation every region and every person should feel and see the benefit so we be pleased to see investment in public transport and public infrastructure but must ask the minister where be the plan and the money for rural area he will remember that at the budget we liberal democrats support and welcome the government change to the fiscal rule that allow for borrow and more productive investment and we be delighted to see that one of the beneficiary of today announcement be the metrolink to stockport which be testimony to the hard work of the liberal democrats who have be campaign on this for far long than the mayor and the combine authority have even exist from shropshire to the south west from cumbria to cornwall and from norfolk to newton abbot rural area once again feel as if they have be forget will the government therefore bring forward rural growth strategy may also ask the minister about wales we know that and the oxford cambridge line have be designate england wales line as oppose to england only line can he explain to the people of wales why that have happen and why they be set to lose out on barnett consequential there be one big piece miss from the puzzle many of we rightminde people want to see investment in infrastructure but if we want to build stuff we need skilled people to build it will the government now fix the apprenticeship levy so that it can be spend on skill and training when will the government produce their skill strategy why have skills england be set up as an executive agency of the department for education rather than have employer at its heart as be promise and why be the government scrap the level apprenticeship when we know that it support social mobility include into engineering we welcome this investment into transport infrastructure but that transport infrastructure will not build itself we need the people skilled to do it be pleased that the liberal democrats welcome today announcement which be specifically about investment in city region the house will know that at the autumn budget the chancellor say that this labour government be choose investment over decline which be why we be increase investment in every part of the country announcement outside of city region will come next week at the spending review to some of the hon lady broad question on policy can tell she that we will debate the infrastructure strategy the week after that she will have to bear with but she should know that there be good news come because labour be deliver very much welcome the commitment to city region nationally our city region have underperformed on growth compare with continental city on south yorkshire welcome the billion to restore and renew our tram network and to improve our bus service but understand from the mayor that discussion be still under way about tram train project to link stocksbridge in the north to beighton and woodhouse in my constituency in the south that project will unlock site for housing and employment growth will my right hon friend agree to give further consideration to discussion with the mayor to unlock that extra funding for those growth project as my hon friend have mention the mayor of south yorkshire have be give billion which be in line with our commitment to devolution and to city region mayor it be for the mayor to decide how that money be spend as my hon friend suggest the mayor have announce that some of this money will be allocate to the tram network but it will be for the mayor and the combine authority to decide how to use the balance of this funding for other project in the region as always be very happy to meet he and the mayor to consider what option be available recognise the importance of assist the city region to boost the economy but my brigg and immingham constituency cover the south bank of the humber which be home to cluster of energy business that be of particular importance to the renewable sector can the chief secretary to the treasury outline what resource will be make available for that area to support improvement both in rail connection and also to the which provide access to the major port of immingham the government recognise the strategic importance of the hon member region to the uk economy this will be reflect in the industrial strategy when it be publish in the come week alongside our other plan on his specific question announcement for funding outside of the transport for city regions funding will be make at the spending review next wednesday twenty year ago when first stand for election be tell to limit my ambition with regard to campaigning to bring the metro to washington but persist and now thank to this labour government and the new mayor of the north east my ambition be go to be realise do the chief secretary to the treasury agree that that be the difference that labour in government can make and that what we be see be promise make and promise deliver congratulate my hon friend on her decade of campaign for that project also welcome her suggestion that this be labour government deliver the change that they promise to the country but may add to that and say that it be also the difference that brilliant labour mp can make in their constituency campaign for change for their constituent offer many congratulation to my hon friend and hope that she will be able to cut the ribbon when the line be up and run the minister talk about regional growth but in north east scotland we see only cost and decline under this labour government let we take the oil and gas sector labour policy will cost almost job by the end of this decade and billion in economic income by the uk eu deal will cost fisherman in scotland billion two third of scottish farmer will be impact by the family farm tax with of farm halt their investment which again hit the rural business that would be supply they can the minister name single policy that this labour government have introduce that benefit regional growth in north east scotland can reconfirm to the house that this labour government have deliver the large real term increase in funding for scotland since devolution begin furthermore may politely point she to the fact that the announcement today be about england not scotland further announcement on our commitment to deliver new direction in scotland will be come next week in the spending review very much welcome the labour government delivery of billion of investment for the tees valley and particularly the million for the third platform at middlesbrough station the money to increase the station capacity which hope will mean increase the number of direct train to london will complement the recent modernisation work that have be complete which begin campaign on in with the then middlesbrough mayor dave budd there be many priority in which this money could be invest include the repair of the iconic transporter bridge take bus back into control la andy burnham and electrification of our rail line can the chief secretary to the treasury set out the importance of combine authority mayor consult with local authority and local community and make good use and good value of this award congratulate my hon friend on secure this investment in his constituency the key difference of course be that when he start campaign for it we be under conservative government and now under labour government we be deliver on his question about work with combine authority mayor he be right to point out that the most effective combine authority mayor in england be those who work in partnership with their local member of parliament to ensure that every part of their authority area be hear and involve in decision making and encourage the mayor of teesside to do just that people in cumbria north yorkshire and durham be deeply concerned to see no mention at all in the chancellor announcement of the dualle project which be vital to boost the economy of the north and more importantly to save life there be not penny for the northern two third of the north west of england so will the chief secretary to the treasury allay cumbria fear and commit now to the upgrade think the hon member be slightly confused the statement today be about devolve transport funding to mayor for intra city transport he be ask question on the broad spending in the department for transport which will be announce in the spending review next wednesday congratulate my right hon friend on an announcement that will make huge difference to deliver the

that will be next week at the spending review meur ras bras madam deputy speaker thoroughly welcome the treasury green book review because the current funding formulae do not reflect the true cost of deliver service in remote coastal area such as cornwall they do not account for the scatter nature of deprivation the cost associate with seasonal surge in demand the cost associate with the influx of

camborne redruth and hayle and across cornwall despite our massive economic potential will the chief secretary assure constituent in remote coastal community such as cornwall that there will be specific change to reflect our specific challenge thank my hon friend and the wide group of labour members from cornwall who have campaign vociferously on the green book that may seem technical but for the people at home it be important because it allude to all the issue that my hon friend point out not least because in the past government have make decision about particular project as oppose to particular place that mean that we can not unlock the potential for growth and well livelihood because of failure of apply the green book and its rule the chancellor announce today that the green book update will be publish next week at the spending review can give my hon friend the guarantee that the detail of that when it be publish will show that this government will look much more widely at how

this government be commit to invest in every region and nation of the country today announcement be about city region and city region transport but the spending review next week will show how this

also campaign for upgrade to the cross city line and in particular to the king norton station work to make the most of this new investment will the minister confirm that he and his department for transport colleague remain open to constructive representation so that we can finally make this important project happen thank my hon friend for campaign for his constituency and for welcome this historic funding of billion today for the west midland he ask about future project the good news be that the mayor of the west midlands have not spend all of this money yet so there be definitely potential for lobby he on how he might wish to spend the rest of that money in due course and if there be anything can do to help will be glad to do so the statement say that strong transport link be crucial and the department for transport have already pay through the union connectivity fund for feasibility study on the reopening of the lisburn antrim rail line which would connect to belfast international airport in my constituency unfortunately they have already tell that they can not allocate funding until the next spending review be announce so they have beat the chief secretary to that answer give that the billion that have be allocate today roughly equate to million as barnett consequential would he agree that investment in that lisburn antrim belfast international line would be good investment in northern ireland railway the hon member rightly allude to the fact that because the labour government be increase investment here in westminster for the whole country the nation of scotland wales and northern ireland benefit both through barnett and direct spending from this government to make sure we be invest in every nation and region of the country we have already see significant amount of funding think the high level of funding since devolution begin into northern ireland as well as scotland and wales and further detail will be publish next week at the spending review in the east midland we have be rag for over decade against the inequality that have leave our region at the very bottom when it come to spending on transport per person and it have take labour

the queen parade development it be one of the regional scheme that be deliver and million be set aside by westminster for that project it be sign and seal and the project be go ahead it be estimate that some million of regeneration will come off the back of it so whenever the government spend money here they can be assure that the benefit be significant the minister have also hint at the possibility of other money come through what commitment can he give to ensure that coastal community across all of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland can apply to similar scheme to improve the beauty and tourist attraction of all our coastal town and centre thank the hon member for continue his work campaign for strangford and for northern ireland in general as he know detail

improve our child journey through life thank my hon friend for his campaigning for bury and for welcome the investment today he point to two issue that be really important first why be this happen now it be because of the decision take by labour government after the fail promise of the conservative party he ask about child poverty as he know this government be commit to tackle child poverty and the child poverty taskforce will report in due course he will also know that for family who be experience child poverty the good lever to alleviate the situation be help into work those parent who be able to and want to work we be invest in affordable reliable public transport alongside childcare support at school in the early year we be not give people false promise which they be give in the past we be give they path to be part of the success that we be set up the country to deliver it have be good to hear so much talk about leave behind community today but have always hat that phrase because my

the member for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson for the extension of the metro to washington and the world class angel network that will be build by mayor kim mcguinness but do the minister

genuinely welcome the significant investment in city region around our country that the chief secretary have be able to announce stoke on trent do not have combine authority and realistically will not have one for many year to come but my constituent aspiration for significant growth and investment be no different from the aspiration of those in other part of the west midland my constituent would like the reinstatement of the number bus from mount pleasant to hanley for example and would like lift instal at longton train station to make it accessible have absolute faith that the chief secretary be aware of the nuance of the difference between mayoral and non mayoral area but will he give commitment today that when announcement be make next week in the comprehensive spending review

communicate they to devolve leader and to recognise the development and growth opportunity that rural community offer our economy thank my hon friend for the campaigning he undertake for his

deeply disturbing that these incident happen near the new gaza humanitarian foundation distribution site they highlight the utterly desperate need to get aid in the israeli government say they have open up aid access with their new system but the warning raise by the uk the united nations aid partner and the international community about these operation have materialise and the result be agonising israel newly introduce measure for aid delivery be inhumane foster desperation and endanger civilian israel unjustified block on aid into gaza need to end it be inhumane israel must immediately allow the un and aid partner to safely deliver all type of aid at scale to save life reduce suffering and maintain dignity it must ensure that food and other critical supply can reach people safely where they be across all the gaza strip civilian and medical and humanitarian worker and facility must be protect we will continue to be steadfast in our support for the un and other

restriction on humanitarian aid support delivery by the united nations we will once again use our vote in support of those goal follow our leadership in co ordinate dozen of country to address the humanitarian situation and the joint statement by the uk france and canada as well as the action announce by my right hon friend the foreign secretary on may we will continue to convene international partner to increase the pressure and take further step to address the catastrophic situation on the ground we will continue to strongly support the effort lead by the united states qatar and egypt to secure an immediate ceasefire in gaza as the prime minister have say ceasefire be the good way to secure the release of all remain hostage and achieve long term political solution the israeli government decision to expand their military operation in gaza and severely restrict aid undermine all of those goal we repeat our utter condemnation of hamas and our demand that they release all hostage immediately and unconditionally hamas can have no role in the future governance of gaza two state solution be the only way to bring the long last peace stability and security that both israelis and palestinians deserve we welcome france and saudi arabia leadership in chair an international conference later this month commend this statement to the house call the shadow foreign secretary be grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement the scene emanate from gaza be harrowing and the suffering be intolerable the current situation that we be all witness simply can not continue the level of humanitarian suffering and desperation continue to be unacceptable as child woman and their family continue to suffer while desperately try to secure food and humanitarian aid the death and casualty near aid distribution centre should never have happen will the minister inform the house what discussion have take place with israel about those appalling event the status of any investigation and what action will follow britain must use its influence at every level and bring all ally together we want peace and stability in the region include in neighbouring country as the current conflict be hurt civilian and sustainable end to the conflict appear to have move even far away be we work with our abraham accord partner and regional ally who also want peace such as jordan egypt saudi arabia and qatar britain must leverage its considerable influence in the region to help stop the endless suffering that we be see to get more aid in to see the hostage release and to end the terminal situation with hamas to achieve proper sustainable end to the conflict and importantly work towards well future for the palestinian and israeli people to that end will the minister explain how the government plan to use the upcoming summit in new york to further those end on humanitarian aid the government say that they continue to call for broad aid access of course we support that but be there practical and specific proposal for the opening of individual crossing and entry point have those be present directly to the government of israel the minister will know that my noble friend lord cameron work with our ally previously secure commitment from the government of israel to open up the erez crossing and the port of ashdod to get aid into gaza he will also know that at that time israel agree to extend the opening hour of the kerem shalom crossing point and we be able to achieve commitment to increase the number of truck enter gaza which naturally lead to an increase in vital aid supply include food and medical aid for innocent palestinians on british aid sit in the region the minister have say in write answer to on monday quantify how much be await entry into gaza be difficult due to the complex operating environment and limited real time datum we appreciate that but what more can he do to secure practical information about where uk aid be locate who we can work with to move aid to key location and what more britain can do to ensure that uk aid get to those who be desperately in need of our support we know that multilateral institution include the world bank and other be work on serious plan to deal with immediate as well as long term issue to support the recovery and reconstruction of the economy in gaza and the west bank what be the government do to support that work and what engagement have the minister have with those organisation some remain hostage have now be in cruel captivity for day at the hand of hamas they must be release we be aware of initiative put forward by the united states and that the late proposal have be reject by hamas what pressure be the government exert on hamas to get they to reverse their opposition to those plan on the west bank the government sign memorandum of understanding with the palestinian authority on april which we debate in the house will the minister update the house on the pa progress since that signing on reform and governance because credible governance be require for long term stability on settlement the conservative position be as it be in government and be well understand settlement be not helpful for achieve long term peace and we urge israel for its part not to take step that could make two state solution more difficult and to use its legal system to clamp down on settler violence we support two state solution that guarantee security and stability for both the israeli and palestinian people finally we all want to lift people live to well future for the israeli and palestinian people to do so britain must actively bring our long stand perspective and influence to bear in the region with all our ally thank the shadow foreign secretary for her important question confirm that we be work closely with our ally both in the region and beyond on this devastating situation see colleague from jordan egypt saudi arabia and qatar at the madrid conference day ago and will be continue my consultation with they over the come day as will the foreign secretary the right hon lady rightly ask about the status of the ceasefire negotiation be sure that she be aware that on sunday call for hamas to return to those negotiation there have be some promising indication that they be do so but it remain very delicate situation and will update the house with more solid information when be in position to do so we of course want those ceasefire talk to proceed with speed we want full release of all hostage and permanent ceasefire and we do not want hamas in control in gaza that be the objective of this government the shadow foreign secretary also ask an important question about where uk aid be and how much have go in and be grateful for her understanding on those point fear much of that aid remain in many of the humanitarian distribution centre outside gaza block as it be when see it with my own eye in egypt thank the minister for his statement but we have be here countless time before last week israel approve further settlement in the west bank israeli defence minister katz claim it be strategic move that prevent the establishment of palestinian state what more evidence do we need to call this exactly what it be deliberate policy of annexation and genocide will the government now take the long overdue step that we have all be call for for year namely the recognition of palestine sanction on extremist israeli government ministers suspension of all arm sale and suspension of all trade if we want to see palestinian state we must do something now to prevent its erasure the history book will not be kind to this government unless we use every form of leverage at our disposal and our grandchild will ask why we effectively stand by while people be eradicate by bomb bullet starvation and no doubt the further ethnic cleansing that be still to come this should shame we all thank my hon friend for her question of course it be her request for an urgent question this morning that lead to this statement do not agree with the whole premise of her question but assure she that we will continue to convene international partner to increase pressure and to take further step as long as this catastrophic situation remain we have take step since we be first elect we announce further step on may when the foreign secretary be at the dispatch box and we will take further step which we be clear about in the joint statement between the uk france and canada until the situation improve call the liberal democrat spokesperson be grateful to the minister for advance sight of his statement speak yesterday with british surgeon who have regularly visit gaza to deliver emergency medical aid he first report case of malnutrition month ago and be deeply anxious about what he will find when he arrive at nasser hospital in southern gaza later this month people in gaza be on the brink of starvation other be die daily from gunshot wound inflict as they queue for food the situation be intolerable and it be deliberate the policy of netanyahu government amount to an indiscriminate assault on the palestinian people we must get the aid in we must get the hostage out and we must stop the violent force displacement of palestinians in gaza and in the west bank that be the only path back to ceasefire the time for timidity be over liberal democrats have consistently call for the government to take firm action and they must do so today we call for the sanctioning of the extremist ministers ben gvir and smotrich month ago will the minister finally commit to implement those sanction show that we will no long tolerate call for palestinian dispossession will the government make it clear that unless the israeli government change course the uk will expand sanction to those ministers and members of the knesset who support continuation of the blockade and the current military action will the government finally ban the export of all uk arm to israel in his response early the prime minister say that the government be work with ally to get aid into gaza can the minister expand on what option be under consideration and when they could be implement last week announcement of new settlement in the west bank the large expansion in year be intolerable the uk should have no part in this so will minister introduce legislation now to ban all uk trade with the illegal settlement will the government use the conference later this month together with ally such as france finally to recognise the state of palestine show beyond doubt the uk commitment to palestinians right to self determination and two state solution the liberal democrat spokesperson allude to some of the commentary of some israeli government ministers want to be clear that the uk government issue be with netanyahu government it be with the statement and action of many of those ministers as member will know will not discuss from this dispatch box sanction that we might take but what will say be that we watch very closely the statement that have come out we have condemn they repeatedly and they have not stop they have continue we keep this under very close review call the chair of the international development committee the gaza humanitarian foundation be no such thing it be group of trigger happy private security employee under international law israel as the occupier have duty to the people in gaza the international court of justice issue an advisory opinion on july state that israel policy and practice be contrary to the prohibition of forcible transfer of the protect population under article of the fourth geneva convention the government have still not give their response to this and if be to be very uncharitable and hopefully very wrong would say that this have create limbo whereby the government be not use their full toolbox of sanction prohibition and legal accountability to hold israel and indeed hamas to account when will the government act and acknowledge that they have duty under this advisory opinion we continue to consider the icj advisory opinion with the seriousness that it deserve want to reassure the house that the power of the foreign office be not set by our view on an advisory opinion which be just that advisory we abide by international law in all that we do and our option be not constrain by the fact that we have not yet pronounce view on the advisory opinion as the hon member for liverpool wavertree paula barker indicate we be all frankly get bit feed up with the theatric in this chamber and if be honest with the minister it feel like the whole house be be play he show up and mouth the word full of condemnation and say he be appalled and very occasionally the government leak out just enough sanction in order frankly be afraid to say this colleague to keep the labour benches from open revolt and yet since the minister last appear here as other have mention new settlement have be announce and the israeli government have replace the united nations relief and works agency distribution system with shoot gallery an abattoir where starve people be lure out through combat zone to be shoot at if the situation be reverse we would now quite rightly be mobilise the british armed force as part of an international protection force so here be my question what be the difference hope the right hon member will forgive he talk of theatric whereby come to the house and provide an update and he deliver speech say that we should do more remind he and the house that the labour government have profoundly different position towards these issue than the conservative government before we we have take series of step most recently on may not single thing have change nothing they be ignore you now be sorry but they be kill dozen every day order call the minister we have take step and we will continue to take step we have lead the international community in the most recent of those step be and we be under no illusion about the severity of the situation that we face welcome the minister comment that israel newly introduce measure for aid delivery be inhumane foster desperation and endanger civilian indeed in just eight day palestinians seek food have be kill and have be injure what discussion be the minister have with his israeli counterpart about ensure the protection of innocent civilian who be access lifesave aid regret to inform the house that there be fundamental disagreement between the british and israeli government about the nature of aid that need to get into gaza we have speak to they and we have be clear that the united nations be ready with system that work and that be able to deliver aid at the scale require to try to address some of the horrific desperation that we see the israeli government be clearly commit to the gaza humanitarian foundation with all of the problem that we have see over the last three day the policy of successive uk government have be that the united kingdom will recognise the state of palestine when it be conducive to the peace process and the ultimate realisation of the two state solution up to this point have accept the argument that the minister and his predecessor have make that that moment have not yet come but have not the balance shift decisively with succession of move to great territorial change in the west bank by increase settlement activity and by increasingly blunt and frequent statement from member of the israeli government that they be go to restrict palestinians to sub set of gaza or restrict they from gaza all together that be what have change my mind such that now believe that it be necessary for the uk hopefully in conjunction with other to recognise the state of palestine urgently why have it not yet change the government mind the right hon and learn member make very powerful point one reason that the traditional position of uk government and many other government across the world have be that the recognition of palestinian state should come at the end or during two state solution process be the hope that we would move towards two state solution many mind have be change like the right hon and learn gentleman because of the rhetoric of the israeli government the clear statement by so many that they be no long commit to two state solution we see in the press many representative of the israeli government criticise other for consider their position in relation to palestinian state exactly as the right hon and learn member say it be the action of this israeli government that have make so many include ourselves review their position on these matter the time have come for we to stop arm israel in any way whatsoever this collaborative pool of item that be gather under the auspex of nato seem to be route by which israel can be supply be it not possible for we to withdraw the right for anything we supply to that collaborative pool to be pass on to israel or even to influence our partner in that pool to stop provide any form of weaponry to israel via that route let first address my hon friend question about arm more broadly and then turn to the we have take step to ensure that weapon directly for use in gaza have be suspend as my hon friend have outline there be provision in the programme for global spare pool the operation of which we do not control understand the argument sometimes make in this house that in fact we could control the final destination of those part but that be point that we refute it be be debate in the court and judgment be forthcoming on the question of whether or not the final destination of part could indeed be determine be afraid that have nothing further to add on that point however want to be clear to the house as my right hon friend the minister for trade policy and economic security be on monday evening that the arm suspension that we have introduce be far reach some report have suggest that we have not take far reach action and that significant arm be still reach the israel defence forces but that be simply factually not true the sale of item that be control by the arm licensing criterion continue as we still judge that many military grade item for example body armour for non governmental organisation be appropriate to be trade with israel because they will go to ngos that be go in it be also true that we be trade component that will end up in use outside of israel in the arsenal of nato ally for example of the million of export licence that have be approve subsequent to our decision million of they be for component for nato ally not for israel there be considerable confusion about that point so want to take the opportunity to clarify it secure ceasefire be vital secure the release of the remain hostage be vital and get aid through to the suffer people of gaza be an absolute moral imperative the israeli government need to ensure the safe delivery of that aid and if they do not the member of that government should suffer immediate and severe consequence no more prevarication will the minister also make an assessment of what the impact of cut to the united kingdom aid budget have be on the ability to deliver aid in gaza and elsewhere and will he work with his un colleague to ensure that all the resource that this government could possibly provide to the united nations get through so that aid get through and stop the dying and the suffering to be clear the issue with aid get into gaza be not the availability of aid the cut we have announce have have no bearing on whether or not aid can get into gaza know that because have see our aid with my very own eye in warehouse in al arish we must remain focused on the central issue which be neither the availability of aid nor the availability of partner such as the united nations that be prepared to go in and deliver it it be that the israeli government have effectively put in place blockade that be the central issue that must be address almost eight month ago the un commission of inquiry find that israel have implement concerted effort to dismantle the healthcare system in gaza and that the killing and disappearance of healthcare worker amount to the crime of extermination uk doctor in gaza describe it as slaughterhouse with the grow mountain of evidence detail war crime take place and our diplomatic effort be totally ignore by the israeli government it be time to sanction benjamin netanyahu and the other murderous figure who be responsible word be not enough so today here now in this chamber would like the minister to give we concrete date for when we can expect this government to impose sanction hear the frustration of the house be sure that other member will also raise the deeply distressing report that there have be in recent day and indeed go even far back in both the west bank and in gaza let be clear as the prime minister be clear with france and canada if israel do not cease the renew military offensive and lift its restriction on humanitarian aid we will take further concrete action in this place hon member when will not say from the dispatch box today when that might be concur entirely with the view express by the two privy counsellors on the conservative back benches who have already speak my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse and my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright for week we have be listen to fine word from government front benchers and we have see lot of handwringing and vast amount of inactivity the question that everybody in this chamber be ask of the minister be when yesterday as he know four of we try to deliver letter to downing street call for the immediate recognition of the state of palestine we be not even allow to deliver that letter the time have come to act now there be route from larnaca in cyprus straight into gaza use it let we save these child thank the right hon gentleman for the force of his remark hear so many colleague say that they be feed up with my word which be gentle but on may we announce concrete action be tell the house this afternoon that further action will come if there be not change hon member when will return to the house when be in position to do so hear everybody frustration but let we not pretend that the uk position have not change that it have not continue to change it will continue to change while the situation remain as it be genocide case against israel be before the international court of justice and the international criminal court have issue arrest warrant against prime minister netanyahu and other in its judgment the icj make it clear that nation duty to prevent genocide begin when it become aware that there be serious risk on monday in response to my write question the minister confirm that almost all of gaza face critical risk of famine with half million innocent people face starvation we know that be cause by israel months long blockade of aid so have the minister be satisfactorily notify that there be serious risk of genocide occur in palestine and will he ensure that the government take all step to meet our obligation to prevent genocide we abide by all of our international legal obligation and keep these matter under rapid review my hon friend rightly highlight the risk of malnutrition and famine in gaza as identify by the integrate food security phase classification we take very serious note of all of these report as they come out can not help but feel that the minister be treat member with significant level of contempt by tell we that something will happen but not tell we what that will be or when it will happen on more acute point can he perhaps clarify for the house why he believe it be consistent for his government to condemn the israeli government for starve civilian population while at the same time provide they with the component part to bomb civilian population be surprised that the right hon member think that there be any question as to why foreign office ministers might need to leave some degree of ambiguity about when they take action include all the one that have be discuss this afternoon such as sanction these principle of why we might want to do thing without pre notify the house of each and every step be relatively well establish think but be happy to discuss in further detail why we do that on the point about component where we know that they be go to israel we be suspend that it be only because we be not able to control the onward transmission of the global spare pool that this at least theoretical risk exist thank the minister for all the work he be do and the endless number of statement he have have to make on these horrific issue absolutely agree with he and support he in call for both israel and hamas to make sure that all humanitarian aid be available and get to innocent palestinians who desperately need it the good way that we can solve this problem be through ceasefire will he join in express regret that after israel accept the witkoff framework proposal for ceasefire hamas decide to turn they down we must put as much pressure as possible on hamas to move forward with the ceasefire as soon as possible on sunday be clear that hamas should engage in ceasefire talk should return to the table and should release all hostage ceasefire be desperately need and be the only route forward studied ambiguity of what and when have have no impact on israeli policy we want to know and israel need to know precisely what the government mean by further step the right hon member will appreciate that in our private discussion with israel we have be clear about the depth of feeling across the whole country and indeed in this house and we have be clear about the nature of further step come be sure the minister can sense the frustration across the house and from all party support their frustration we be at meeting yesterday with the former un secretary general for human right andrew gilmour he say that the lack of action that the international community be take now on this issue remind he of the lack of action during the rwandan genocide in the that be lesson we all should closely heed will not ask the minister everything that everybody else have ask about sanction and recognition he know where stand on that will ask he about the coalition of the willing for palestine as we have coalition of the willing for ukraine how be we build up our international ally to ensure that recognition and everything else that need to happen have an international consensus again we be look at day not week and month just want to acknowledge for my hon friend that we recognise that this conflict be be measure in hour and day not week and month and it be on those timeline that we seek to take action on the question of coalition of the willing we be work with our ally as be sure she be aware we convene the statement of on humanitarian action and the leader statement of three to which refer early in my statement we will continue to work broadly can confirm that even today have be work on those question the uk government have an obligation under international law to do everything possible to prevent genocide yet we see genocide occur in gaza the minister assure the house month ago that he be conduct risk assessment on genocide in gaza will he give clear unambiguous straight answer today will he publish his most recent genocide risk assessment without delay as this house have hear from before the question that we assess in relation to international humanitarian law be whether there real risk of breach of ihl that be the assessment we make when we first enter government that be considerably low bar than the question to which the hon member refer we continue to make those assessment which cover the entirety of international humanitarian law we have update the house on that initial assessment which be at rather low bar than she be suggest and the assessment broadly remain in place we will not provide further update but if the position change will be sure to return to the house appreciate the minister come back to the chamber but as he can see from the strength of number here this be an issue that will not go away the minister just outline to my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams the chair of the work and pensions committee that we be measure this in hour and day not week and month there be only one kidney dialysis unit leave in gaza and the world health organisation report that the number of machine have decrease with just leave in northern gaza my late mum have renal failure she be on dialysis three time week it be not hour and day it be minute minister people be literally survive or die within minute many people woman and child be still bury under rubble number of we have speak about the lack of aid go in and the fact that aid be be use as weapon of punishment what more do we need to say for we to see concrete and more visible action from this government we be get email from our constituent we need to see an end to some of the weapon go through process which the uk be still support we need clear guidance on sanction because israel be not listen to we recognise that when we talk in this chamber about aid restriction it can seem like an abstract concept my hon friend be right about what that look like person to person there be terrible shortage of all kind of desperately need item that preserve life and dignity and nothing about the last few day indicate that the new aid measure be do anywhere near enough to try to avert that tragedy we not only make our own assessment but pay careful heed to the assessment of other be diplomat before the international committee of the red cross be sober organisation that be not prone to strong statement and the statement that it have make in recent day about the condition in gaza be sober reading we be under no illusion about the urgency and the gravity of the situation be pleased to be with the foreign secretary on may when he announce further measure we have be clear that further measure will come we be try as the shadow foreign secretary the right hon member for witham priti patel have ask we to persuade the israelis to change course if they do not we will return to this house listen carefully to the answer that the minister give to the right and proper question from the hon member for high peak jon pearce just now will the minister not accept that simply call for hamas to go back to the negotiating table be nowhere near strong enough for there to be accuracy in this debate it must be publicly and clearly acknowledge that the only blocker to ceasefire deal that will get the hostage out and the body return of those hostage who have die be hamas we have condemn hamas have condemn hamas repeatedly and we will continue to do so ceasefire clearly require two party we welcome israel return to the ceasefire negotiation we call on hamas to do the same we be glad to hear that there seem to have be some progress we will continue to press all side on this point until we have ceasefire yesterday the united nations human right chief volker türk this must have break everyone heart in this place say palestinians have be present the grim of choice die from starvation or risk be kill while try to access the meagre food that be be make available through israel militarise humanitarian assistance mechanism feel like broken record what concrete action will we take in this place so that the minister stand at the dispatch box and do something to change israel psyche so that it listen to the world my hon friend ask to change the government of israel psyche we have be clear with the israeli government about the extent of our disagreement anyone who have closely follow the communication between and my israeli counterpart will see that there be profound disagreement in approach we do everything we can to try to persuade our long stand ally why the step that it be take be such grave mistake not just for the region and for the palestinians but ultimately for the israelis themselves our disagreement be with the government not the israeli themselves it will be with regret if return shortly to this house to announce further step but will do so give the strength of our feeling on these matter as the minister have acknowledge israel alternative aid scheme be dangerous unworkable and profoundly insufficient there be aid wait on the border uk aid that my constituent have pay for you know the palestinian people desperation you have hear the desperation order the hon lady say you twice the minister have hear the palestinian people desperation he have hear the desperation in this chamber what new pressure will he bring to bear on israel to open the aid route what be the alternative plan the minister have ask for an independent inquiry into what go on in rafah will he insist that the israeli government let the bbc and independent journalist into gaza so that we know what be go on the hon lady make an important point about the lack of international medium in gaza and the hotly contest nature of event there it be not just who have call for an independent investigation the un secretary general have as well that reflect the degree of concern within the united nations system about enable the medium to their job minister if we do not recognise palestine it will cease to exist and commend my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker israel have approve another settlement site in the occupy west bank the big expansion in decade it violate international law minister louis theroux incredible documentary the settlers which will be show today he be in parliament today highlight the grim reality of the settler mindset minister you must agree that it be time that we have strong debate you can not persuade order the hon lady be well than that the passion be overtake madam deputy speaker minister do you not agree that we order people keep address the minister as minister they should be ask their question through the chair the hon lady should say do he agree absolutely madam deputy speaker do the minister agree that it have go far enough and that we must have this debate and say we will apply sanction to israel no more arm should go to israel we must see the palestinians as people and help they to survive be grateful to my hon friend who be just try to make as new member of the house feel that everybody make mistake be also grateful for that important question as my hon friend know we have take action against the settler in the documentary and other recognise that the situation in gaza and the west bank remain awful we have condemn the settlement that be announce over the recess we have be clear that further step will be take and will be happy to return to the house when be in position to do so the minister say he hear the frustration of the house but do the government hear the cry of gaza orphan child and the cry of the child who have have their love one literally blow to bit in front of they who will be maim for life have be at many of these statement before be grateful for what the minister say and also put on the record that be grateful for what the shadow foreign secretary say but the reality be that aid be not get through there be un station before but there be now only handful they be in combat zone and people be unable to access the aid every single day man woman and child be be impact through lack of food access to aid access to medical supply and access to fuel so that they can actually cook some of the food some very practical issue do not support the new way of deliver aid it should be do by the un but if that be go to be the case what more can the minister do with the americans to ensure that there be more aid station in more place so that more people can access aid in order to save life be grateful for the right hon gentleman word there be clearly profound issue with the new aid distribution mechanism that be not just the view of the british government it be clearly the view of the ghf itself give that it have suspend operation after three very bloody day exactly as the right hon gentleman say there be insufficient aid distribution centre and very dangerous crowd and we have see terrible violence associate with the distribution would be very happy if there be mechanism in place at this moment that could provide aid properly but wait on the outskirt of gaza in al arish and elsewhere be united nations operation with more than month experience of do that and make sure that everybody get the aid they need we must not delay we have both the aid and the delivery partner we should let they in the barbarism of benjamin netanyahu government against the palestinian people be beyond belief we should not be negotiate trade deal with the israeli government we should not have trade envoy on the ground and we should not delay recognition of the state of palestine the business and trade committee back by my hon friend the members for slough mr dhesi and for rotherham sarah champion be determined to get to the bottom of uk arm export be grateful to the business minister for confirm last night that he will appear before the committee before the summer recess can the minister confirm tonight that foreign office minister will be alongside he make it habit not to confirm the schedule of my ministerial colleague of course it be the minister for europe who have responsibility for the overall licensing regime who have appear before my right hon friend committee let be clear to the house there be no effort to conceal our position on arm licence we have set it out to this house on number of occasion the minister for trade my right hon friend the member for lothian east mr alexander set out some of the number on monday we have take exceptional measure to try to show more transparency than be usual about the arm licensing regime we be have that discussion not just in this place but in the court there be no effort on the part of this government to be anything other than transparent not only with this house but with the israeli government themselves about the nature of our decision we can all see that genocide be happen in gaza and it be about time that this government call it out for what it be we be witness the systematic dismantling of gaza healthcare system and the red cross have describe the situation as hell on earth what be this government do to prevent gaza healthcare system from be decimate far and to re establish hospital and lifesave medical service the truth be that while the aid blockade remain in place there be very little that any outside partner can do to ensure proper health service in gaza will not mislead the house by suggest that there be the aid that have come in from the ghf be far too little and far too geographically concentrated to be able to provide the kind of provision to which gazans be entitle and that they should have and it be clear necessity under international humanitarian law on may the foreign secretary inform this house that free trade agreement with israel be be suspend less than week after that announcement the uk trade envoy to israel be in israel the minister in his opening statement say we call for an immediate and independent investigation into these event and for the perpetrator to be hold to account we know who the perpetrator be what evidence do he need from an independent inquiry why do he not take action by suspend the uk trade envoy to prevent he from go to israel why do he not back the lawyer retire senior judge and academic who write to the prime minister early this week to ask for article of the united nations charter to be invoke and for israel to be expel as member state of the united nations the call for an independent investigation begin with the un secretary general give as say early his concern about aid provision the uk support the vital humanitarian role of the un and that be why we have echo his call on the question of the trade envoy visit let be clear that we suspend negotiation on future free trade agreement with israel but we do not suspend all trade with israel as think the house know the trade envoy have no schedule meeting with israeli official but make his visit as part of his regular duty because trade continue between israel and the uk be not sure it be entirely fair to link the visit of trade envoy with the horrific event at aid distribution centre in recent day the minister will be well aware that hamas have threaten to execute any palestinian who dare to take aid from the gaza humanitarian foundation he will also probably be aware that there be strong report that desperate palestinians be break into hamas control warehouse that be stock to the eave with the aid we have provide we all want to see the aid provide to the palestinian people so what plan do he have to convince the israeli government that if aid be flood into gaza it will actually reach the people who need it rather than be take away and stockpile by hamas we be clear that in our view the united nations and its partner have clear mechanism to ensure that humanitarian need be meet and to prevent diversion to hamas we obviously condemn any credible report of hamas divert aid but those report should not be reason why aid be not provide to the palestinian people there be try trust and credible mechanism for distribute the aid that be wait to get in as it should the international red cross chief have say that gaza be bad than hell on earth be it any wonder that he do when those child who have escape bomb face death from starvation the united nations have say that one in five people in gaza face starvation because of the blockade do the minister agree with that the gaza humanitarian foundation be clearly incapable of address the starvation in gaza that be now very clear and that israel should immediately hand over any aid operation to the united nations thank my hon friend for the question think have be clear on that point but yes the united nations should deliver the aid in the principled way that it have previously ward jalal be six year old palestinian girl who last week crawl out of burn school leave behind her mother and two sibling who burn to death mention ward because she be palestinian last month there be al haq case against the government by september innocent palestinian man woman and child like ward and her family be kill the government review case and find one possible breach of international law which be the killing of volunteer at the world central kitchen do the government have any regard for child like ward and the palestinian people of course we have regard to and concern for palestinian people the question at issue in the assessment of risk be complicated legal one they be complicated because the corpus of international humanitarian law end up rely great deal on what be in the mind of commander when they make decision international humanitarian law be tightly constrain and it be difficult to make conclusion about what be in the mind of commander who will not share their thought with we that be why when we make determination we consider other limb of international humanitarian law we be not say that in all the case the action be proportional and necessary to meet the military objective but where we can not determine that we can look to other limb those limb include the obligation on an occupy power relate to the provision of aid and the treatment of detainee those be easy test to meet because they do not require know what be the mind of commander rise order be plan to run this statement for further minute but member should think carefully about how many of their colleague they wish to help to get in and ask short question and short response please let we be short and frank then for many of we in this house this be no long complicate time have run out for claim ambiguity of action since may we have see more settlement it be deliberately make dangerous for people to access aid and the israel defence forces have declare the road to the aid distribution centre combat zone the minister say that the government have raise concern and have call for immediate independent investigation but those have not happen not just in this incident but repeatedly he will not tell we what he will do this be on the conscience of we all so we have to ask he to be clear will he tell we what be not on the table will he rule out thing he have tell we that he be talk about the future but will he rule out immediate recognition of palestine which many of we have be call for the sanction that many of we have be call for and final resolution of the farce if he do at least we will get sense of where this be go order during statement we need briefer question will return to this house when have further announcement parishioner in the matlaske benefice have raise over to support the people of gaza they be visit last year by priest from bethlehem who share how this conflict be impact people there they hope for the return of the hostage and for peace for the palestinian people will not ask the minister to repeat his answer to the question when but will he confirm to they that the tool that he be consider use as next step include sanction against extremist government ministers and formal recognition of palestinian state pay tribute to the work of the hon member constituent so many of our constituent include mine in lincoln be do so much to keep these issue in people mind and to raise fund will not be draw on what further step may be take we be clear in the leader statement that they could include target sanction so he can assure his constituent that that remain under review member have try to reach for the right word to describe what the palestinians be face it be incredibly difficult to convey that within the constraint of parliamentary and diplomatic language will not go over any of the ground that colleague have cover but do the minister agree that it be completely unacceptable on every level to pair aid with military objective will he assure the house that when we as government consider where next we go on israel the unacceptability of those tactic will be take on board thank my hon friend who have raise these issue with many time and be very focused on they completely agree with what he say aid must be deliver in principled way that be vital not just in the middle east but across the entire world we take these issue very seriously and we raise they with force with the israeli government in or year none of we want to look back and say that we could have do more as of december there be licence for the export of military equipment to israel few than half of they be for the idf and the israeli government what comfort do the minister have that the military equipment go to israel be not be use to expand settlement on the west bank be not be use by the civilian staff work at aid centre and be not be use to worsen the situation for the palestinian people thank the hon member for that important question we take these issue very seriously our arm export licensing criterion and system be among the tough in the world and we work very carefully to ensure that the word that the foreign secretary the prime minister and say at this dispatch box be follow all the way through in every decision that we make in some case it be absolutely obvious from the licence that the export could not be use in the way that the hon member describe for example component for submarine can not be use in gaza but we do take enormous care over these question noble friend from the other place remind of conversation that she overhear have with my hon friend the member for coventry south zarah sultana in october israel have begin bomb the civilian population in the gaza strip and my hon friend ask when will they say something as often do say the first thing that come to my mind when they level it to the ground have to ask the minister if that be the change that we be wait for because have ask what our red line be and it seem that we have none history will not look kindly on those who perpetuate genocide or those who assist it whether through the sale of arm or through sheer inaction do the minister accept that this be now we the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse point to action that we might take have to ask why be these action not good enough for the people of palestine how many more people will have to die before we do something my hon friend ask if accept that this be we do not accept that this be we we be in very serious disagreement with the israeli government about the conduct of the conflict that disagreement be ongoing and be strongly feel their policy on gaza and the west bank be not the british government policy not only have condemn it but the prime minister and the foreign secretary have do so repeatedly hear the frustration of the house about further measure but let we accept that the british and israeli government disagree profoundly on this question that the disagreement between we be deeply feel and that british policy be as it be and be not what the netanyahu government be do hundred of my constituent have write to express their desperation and horror at the hellish scene come out of gaza so speak here on their behalf it be clear that the israeli government aspire to wipe palestine off the map as they expand their settlement ambition with impunity they do not care that ministers in whitehall be watch their statement until palestine be recognise as state the dispossession of land and home by israel will continue why will the government not stand up now and alongside our ally spain norway and ireland recognise palestine as state recognise the concern of many constituent across the country include in the hon lady constituency we be obviously in close touch with our counterpart be talk to my spanish counterpart on sunday and at the madrid conference be with my irish counterpart and those from the other nation the hon lady mention and from whole set of state that have recognise palestinian state recognise the desire right across this house think for further step in that area whatever we do be sure that this house will press on the continue horror in gaza in everything we do we be focus on try to make an impact on the scene that our constituent be see we be consider these matter but we be focus on try to reduce the suffering in gaza today welcome the minister update to the house but he will know that we see not only the horror and inhumane violence of the israeli government in gaza but aggression on the west bank welcome the government condemnation of the new settlement and look forward to hear word about the force transfer from palestinian village that we be see this week the minister recognise the anger and frustration in this house what more would he need to see happen before we take further action on sanction against extremist ministers and take action to recognise palestine at the un conference in come week the settlement be not only appalling but illegal we put in place sanction against individual and organisation on may clearly that have not deter minister smotrich and other from continue to try to expand settlement on the west bank the viability of two state solution and of the two state live side by side be be undermine and we will continue to take action to avert that the minister rightly call for an independent inquiry into israel behaviour in deny food medicine and vital aid to the people of gaza in the same spirit would he welcome an independent inquiry into the british government policy in relation to jet part for example because this seem to be become ever more mysterious apparently they be sell into the global supply chain but we have no control over what happen to they they might end up in the hand of israel or they might not be he seriously expect the house to believe that the manufacturer of these component do not trace they do not track they do not label they do not identify they think the government know exactly where those part be go and exactly that they be enable those jet to bomb gaza and take part in act of genocide do this not deserve an independent inquiry we have talk about these issue many time they be in the high court be discuss in judicial review at the moment do not see that this could be any far scrutinise and litigate or what an independent inquiry on the position of the part would achieve be very proud to join thousand of protester surround parliament today demand to know what this government red line be can the minister tell this house what his red line be and when he will stop arm israel and stop bomber drop bomb on school and kill innocent child think have address most of those substantive point already we be clear in our position we have set it out repeatedly privately and publicly and no doubt will be back in the house shortly under the uk strategic export licence criterion licence be prohibit when there be clear risk that item would undermine peace and security or under criterion where the control item might be divert for such us can the minister confirm that the export of all item both those with licence and those that sit outside the rule or that have authorise exemption be be review so that for instance drone for decoy and surveillance use against civilian and aid convoy will fall under the restriction and not go under the radar hesitate in my answer because there be quite few clause in the question and do not want to get it wrong the effect of what have say in parliament bind all our export licence there be not an asterisk or footnote that allow some way around this be full reach approach that have be set out repeatedly in parliament and have be scrutinise by the business and trade committee and the court there be no attempt to fudge the position it be as have set out recognise the minister personal dedication to this issue and his effort in achieve ceasefire but it be impossible to conclude that this be anything less than genocide on that basis will he reflect the will of this house to the foreign secretary and the cabinet that sanction be impose immediately on netanyahu and his genocidal regime know my right hon friend be commit to these issue determination of genocide be for competent court can confirm as do to the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller that we be consider far target sanction in line with the three leader statement of recent week dr al najjar along with nine of his child be murder when an israeli bomb hit their home all this happen while his wife another doctor serve at nasser hospital we all know and we have all see the many thousand of man woman and child line up in cage for food shot as if it be some sort of hunting game we know also that former president biden spokesman mr miller say to sky during an interview that he have no doubt there be war crime but that he do not say so even though he be aware of it when biden be in power do the minister fear that he find himself in the same position and if he do not why do he not do what the thousand encircle this parliament have ask to be do and stop the arm to israel with respect and appreciate the hon gentleman commitment to these issue it be not the badge or the protest that stop the arm to gaza it be the labour government that be the effect of vote for labour government and have labour government interruption hear the frustration of the house have set out what we have do so far have be clear that we will go far the badge be nice but action be what matter and that be what the labour government have do the president of the international committee of the red cross have describe the situation in gaza today as bad than hell on earth but the minister have come to the house today with message that be exactly the same as it be two week ago he condemn the settlement but settlement good be still be sell in our shop he support two state solution but he have not recognise palestinian state he disagree with the israeli government but he will not sanction their extremist minister it be clear that the government of benjamin netanyahu be not listen to the minister word in the context of the slaughter and starvation we be see in gaza the government position be frankly not good enough when will there be further action would not want the house to have the impression that foreign office ministers and the whole of the government be not focus on these issue during the recess we make statement on sunday we be work closely with our partner we make clear statement on may think to the israeli government that there would be further consequence should the situation not improve and will return to this house when be in position to make further announcement can the minister tell how many more child must die before the government finally ban the sale and export of all uk arm include component part to the murderous netanyahu government have see child in gaza my department be able to get two of they out of gaza last week interruption understand the frustration of the house but do not give the impression that what this government be do be not deeply focused on the fate of child in gaza hear those on the opposition benches laugh of course get two child out of gaza be not enough we hear the report across the house but we be do everything we can and we will continue to do so the minister refer to the joint statement with france and canada on may thing have get bad since that point food distribution have be block entirely hunger be be use as weapon and innocent palestinians be pay the price if that statement be to hold up will the minister say what action he will be take with france and canada can not bind the french and canadian government from the dispatch box but we be clear that target sanction would follow among other action if there be not an improvement can commit to the house that that remain under review and will return to this place to provide further announcement the prime minister fail today to answer the question ask by the hon member for argyll bute and south lochaber brendan do the government believe israel be commit genocide yes or no it be long stand position that that be for competent court to determine the approach of the so call gaza humanitarian foundation fly in the face of every establish principle of humane and effective aid delivery as have become quickly apparent the head of the organisation have resign and at least palestinians have be kill kill for simply try to feed their starve family that be an affront to all of we and to the basic principle of human dignity and respect do the minister agree that there have to be full accountability for these atrocity my hon friend be an aid worker and she understand well than most the vital importance of those principle not just in the middle east but right across the world join she and the secretary general in their call man woman and child in gaza do not care that our government have profound disagreement with the israeli government the israeli government do not care either because they be continue to act with impunity it be quite simple there be genocide in gaza be commit by the israeli government we be complicit in that genocide we have the power to act and we be not act what be we wait for why have we not sanction israel for its war crime why have we not implement full arm embargo include on fighter jet part why have we not recognise the state of palestine we can do it because rightly we do it for ukraine why be we not treat palestinian life as equal thank my hon friend for the question she mention ukraine our action have consequence understand that the house may disagree about the position the government have set out about the global spare pool but it be the strongly hold view of this government include the ministry of defence that we can not stop sale to the global spare pool without harm the defence of nato ally at moment of critical vulnerability for european security the government have to act responsibly across all their interest where part be go directly to israel they be suspend but we want the programme to continue not only for reason of our own national security but that of our ally include ukraine the horrific historic tragedy of the palestinian people and particularly the people of gaza be that they be at the mercy of two set of extremist the extremist of hamas but also the extremist of this israeli government national security minister ben gvir say give aid to gaza be mistake delay our victory finance minister smotrich say we be liberate gaza and settle it the minister talk about further step surely now be the time for we to sanction those individual in the israeli government to prove that we do not endorse such extremism let be clear from this dispatch box we do not endorse such extremism will not speculate about sanction from the dispatch box but it be clear that should the situation not improve target sanction will be consider appreciate that as minister of state my hon friend be limit in what he can say from the dispatch box but will he convey back to the foreign secretary and the prime minister the extreme disquiet and unease across the house particularly on the labour benches about the position the government be adopt will he ask the prime minister to come back next week to update the government position tell we that more sanction will be consider and that the recognition of the palestinian state be also now on the agenda and will be forward the whole government from the prime minister down know the extent of concern be not sure that they necessarily watch all these appearance but do not be under any illusion the whole government understand the strength of feeling about these issue in this house in our constituency and across the country as if this situation could not get any bad we now have damn report that israeli fire be kill palestinians try to access aid at militarise distribution centre that be not sanction by the un it show complete disregard for human life do the minister agree that enough be enough and that now be the time to take immediate strong further action against the israeli government share my hon friend concern over event at the rafah crossing and beyond the scene from gaza be intolerable will return to this house when be in position to do so it be clear that this house have no confidence in the government handling of the programme ask the minister the following question what be to stop the government withdraw from the programme and then bilaterally sell the part to country exclude israel this would ensure that we be compliant with international humanitarian law and that no component manufacture in the uk be use to bomb innocent civilian in gaza unilateral withdrawal from the programme would have the effect of fully suspend the programme at time it be require for global peace and security it be disgrace that the foreign secretary be not here but it be unsurprising the majority of the british public support full arm embargo on israel yet this labour government have continue to supply arm export include component for lethal fighter jet thereby enable genocide those jet be not use in ukraine so ministers need to stop say that at the dispatch box the government have also defend this indefensible policy in court claim they have see no evidence of genocide the evidence be overwhelming we know it the minister know it and the government know it do the minister understand that through the decision he make every single day he be personally complicit in genocide would like to address the point about not be use in ukraine the importance of the programme to ukraine be that the deployment of allow redeployment of which be use in the defence of ukraine convenient though it would be to the house it be not possible to divide up defence and national security in that way be confident in what say from the dispatch box the programme help to protect ukraine welcome the minister statement and his effort but he must sense our frustration at the inability to arrest the situation we be see in gaza and the occupy territory in the past few day we have see people kill and many more injure in and around the ghf aid distribution site those of we who have participate in un operation in the past know that this should have be foresee it confirm all our fear about what happen when humanitarian principle be disregarded let we be clear israel be continually and deliberately undermine the institution of international law and we need to respond more strongly israel be not listen when will the government announce sanction on israel extremist government thank my hon and gallant friend who serve for long time in the raf as well as in the united nations these issue be desperate as he know we have take action against israeli settler and extremist and we have be clear that if the israeli government do not change course there will be further measure include target sanction it be clear to all that the action of the israeli government be morally abhorrent welcome the further sanction announce by the secretary of state two week ago but plead with the minister now we must go far on sanction and consider trade measure like the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright now believe it be time to recognise the palestinian state be willing to accept the government position on it but can not any long beg the minister come back to this house extremely soon tomorrow or next week with further concrete measure have hear the force of my hon friend intervention and recognise the feeling right across the house on the need to see the situation in gaza change it be an urgency that be feel by government it be increasingly accept that israel military operation in gaza have forcibly displace and starve million of palestinians and kill ten of thousand amount to genocide the late feature of that be its aid distribution process which today do not deliver aid instead it be dehumanising death trap that see child receive treatment in tent be shoot in the head through the side of the tent for the uk to end its complicity it must pull all the lever to stop israel military action immediately there need to be shift away from condemnation and demand for israel compliance with international humanitarian law to clear unequivocal commitment that if israel do not comply it will be force to comply by whatever mean will the minister make that commitment my hon friend have long commitment to these issue and we be discuss they through the recess clearly the situation in relation to aid in gaza remain absolutely desperate we condemn those scene we do so on sunday we have be clear in our view about the new aid mechanism but let we not escape from the fundamental position of the british government which be that we oppose this operation in gaza we be call on all those involve to return to ceasefire that be what we be work towards colleague from right across the house have express their frustration with the contradictory thing that the minister have say in response to our question we have hear that there will be change when there be change and that there will be new step when new step be available yet in the same statement he have outline how israel newly introduce measure for aid delivery be inhumane foster desperation and endanger civilian surely this week have show that there have be yet another change and that now be the time for action and for change our response do not think that what have say have be incoherent on may we announce leader level statement set out our position on may the foreign secretary come to the dispatch box to announce concrete new measure hear that member would have like to come to the house this afternoon to announce further measure we have be clear at the level of prime minister alongside our ally as one of three with france and canada and with partner about the need for change hear that the house would have like further measure announce this afternoon have commit to return when be in position to do so must take issue with the minister when he say that the people outside this place wear badge and marching be not make difference all that member of the public can do be wear badge and march whereas ministers in government can bring sanction end arm sale and hold the war criminal netanyahu to account quite rightly this government have label russia action in ukraine as war crime and accordingly they bring in significant widespread sanction when will they do the same in relation to israel otherwise this reek of double standard and netanyahu will see the minister and this government as weak weak weak pushover and joke let be clear be not seek to disparage the effort of activist or protester my hon friend ask when we will suspend arm to gaza we have suspend arm to gaza hear the frustration of the house but the labour government take step and be proud of the step that we have take hear the frustration that member want we to go far but let we not pretend that this government have do nothing the scene in gaza be deeply distressing the government have be clear as have be clear this afternoon that we will take further step if thing do not change but we have take measure and we will continue to do so rise that be the end of the statement which have be go on for about minute on point of order madam deputy speaker we have have an hour and half of question it be very unusual for almost every member in this house to be speak with one voice wonder whether she could give some guidance when something be the preserve of the executive mean that it be only the government who can take action for example on international sanction on arm sale and on many of the point we have be discuss today in relation to netanyahu or other ministers in the israeli government how can member in this house who have speak with one voice today ensure that actual change be make in this case it be the responsibility not of this house but of the government and they do not seem to be listen at the moment the hon member have most definitely put her point on the record and those on the treasury bench will have be listen it be not matter for the chair but there be many opportunity that she can

official about decision take in relation to uk involvement and for connected purpose in the aftermath of the iraq war several attempt be make to establish an inquiry surround the conduct of british military operation the government of the day spend many year resist those attempt and demand for an inquiry however they could not prevent the inevitable and in we have the publication of the chilcot inquiry which sir john chilcot have undertake over several year the report find serious failing within the british government who ignore the warning of million of ordinary people who have be protest on the street against the invasion be the leader of the labour party when the report come out and apologise on behalf of the labour party for the catastrophic decision to go to war in iraq history be

international criminal court for crime against humanity britain have play highly influential role in israel military operation first britain have be supply weapon to israel that be be use to bomb the people of palestine this of course start with the previous conservative government but it have continue with the current labour government in fact between october and december alone more arm export licence be grant than be approve by the previous government for the whole of and in september the government suspend some licence but continue to allow the supply of component to the global pool the foreign secretary have accept the fact that jet be be use in violation of international humanitarian law yet at the same time he admit that those part go into the global supply chain and could therefore go to israel the government know full well the implication by justify the continued licensing of those part our government be admit their complicity in what be quite clearly war crime find it truly astounding that they be tell we loud and clear that their participation in this programme be more important than uphold international law and the convention on genocide it be very simple until this government end the sale of weapon to israel they will remain complicit in the mass murder of palestinians in gaza at the present time secondly many of we have repeatedly ask for the truth regard the role of british military basis in cyprus since october military cargo have be airlift from raf akrotiri to israel that cargo have often travel to cyprus from us military basis in other part of europe meanwhile raf shadow aircraft have be conduct nightly surveillance flight over gaza when the prime minister visit raf akrotiri last december he tell troop the whole world and everyone back

that the uk government be engage in military action without be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and that these action implicate its institution and official in the grave breach of international law over the past month our question have be meet with evasion obstruction and silence leave the public in the dark over the way in which the responsibility of government have be discharge transparency and accountability be the cornerstone of democracy the public deserve to know the scale of uk complicity in these atrocity any meaningful inquiry would require the co operation of both government conservative and labour involve in decision making process since october the inquiry need to ask the follow question what arm have be supply to israel which of those weapon have be use in gaza and the west bank be the government position that they can not or will not bring the programme into line with the uk legal obligation what be raf akrotiri be use for be it be use as route for weapon that be be deploy in gaza how many us air force flight have fly from raf akrotiri to israel since october have israel jet be store and repair at raf basis whether akrotiri or anywhere else what video footage do the government have of the war zone from raf flight will they release that footage what intelligence have be pass on to israel what legal advice have the government receive over an assessment of genocide when will they publish that advice finish by remind the house that in october many of we call for an immediate ceasefire for the bombing to stop and for the release of all hostage we condemn those attack but express alarm over the wholly disproportionate nature of the response we warn that we be witness the beginning of the total annihilation of gaza and we plead with political leader on both side to call for peace today some politician have finally begin to backtrack bit perhaps they be frightened of the consequence and of their own inhumanity if there be any integrity in this all those who support the operation of the military there would weep for the palestinian life lose bury under the rubble and the moral cowardice of politician in this country and other who have allow it to go on today we teach child about history bad war crime against humanity they be ask to reflect about how those crime ever come about our future history book will report with shame those who have the opportunity to stop the carnage but fail to act to achieve it we will continue our campaign in the house and outside because we be appal at what be happen our demonstration and the huge

briefly to new clause which be probe amendment that seek to establish couple of fact will start however by thank the minister for his time yesterday and for engage with on the matter know that he take the matter of how we protect ceramic in the uk and indeed how we can enhance that protection as seriously as do new clause be short amendment that simply ask the government to explore and consider how we can well protect ceramic from counterfeit production ensure that when we buy something that purport to have be make in the uk that be in fact the case most ceramic have something call backstamp if we turn over any piece of tableware or giftware in the uk we normally see stamp show the company that make it and the country of origin most notably for most piece it state either make in england or even well make in stoke on trent in staffordshire yes that be in staffordshire as my hon friend say there be factory in newcastle under lyme as well we be however see proliferation of company that seek to pass off material not make in the uk its firing will have take place overseas and it will then be import into the uk with the decorate and final glost fire or hand decorate stage happen in the uk and with simply the word england put on to it that way the consumer think that the thing they be buy be uk make product when in fact it be not there be many great company in stoke on trent which know hon friend will reference in their speech will speak briefly of duchess churchill steelite emma bridgewater and the company that proudly put make in england on the back of their product because everything they do be make in england the clay be first mould first fire glaze decorate second fire and sell in the uk it be genuinely british product and there be value in that product we know from the export market to south korea and america in particular that those customer want to buy product that be make in the uk there be some company that quite honestly import from overseas and they be very clear about that plate make by some company in my constituency such as portmeirion quite clearly state that they have be make in china but they sit alongside product make in the uk the company be very up front about that it do not seem to hide it or to try to confuse the consumer it be clear about the fact that it import some of its ware from overseas some company however simply seek to put the word england on the back of their product that will be because the company be probably english register or it be one of the uk historical brand that have long affinity with stoke on trent even if the manufacturing process no long take place there consumer will turn that product over and see the name of one of our historical company and date normally from the or and they will see the word england underneath it it be completely and utterly understandable for they to look at that and think this be product make in england but often it be not new clause ask the government to come forward with an investigation to consider whether there be merit in protect thing that be make in the uk by have that country of origin stamp specifically for ceramic know that the liberal democrats have table similar amendment today that would do this for whole host of product be glad that we be use similar language on this because whether it be food or any other product unrelated to ceramic if they have be make in the uk they should clearly say so my new clause specifically look at ceramic and will not deviate into the speech that be sure will come from the liberal democrat benches another aspect that the minister graciously make time to discuss yesterday be the company particularly chinese company that now seek to copy the backstamp we have some great example from company call dunoon in staffordshire that make excellent ware if consumer buy an item from the company shop it will have make in the uk write on the bottom and little sticker on it that say make in the uk have in my office some chinese copy that have copy the make in the uk sticker and the make in the uk backstamp these be sell through drop ship company online so trace where they actually come from be very difficult any consumer who collect that sort of material would be forgive for think that they be buy something online that have be make in the uk it will have make in the uk backstamp and sticker and all the design element match almost perfectly the one that be make in the uk but the consumer will have no idea where it be make they will also have no idea whether there be element of mercury and cadmium in the glaze that have be use whether the pigment use to decorate it meet the standard we have in the uk or whether it meet the food contact regulation that be require in the uk for item use for drink or eat off the consumer will have no idea about the quality of the clay or what have be add to the clay before fire sometimes in product that be import into the uk from less good manufacturer the clay will have be mix with material that can have harmful effect on the consumer new clause simply ask the government to consider the merit of country of origin mark scheme for ceramic it do not commit the government to bring forward such scheme have ten minute rule bill which be currently wait for free friday when it can get an airing and we can discuss that in more detail this be about try to establish the principle that there be thing that be make in the uk that we value and that if we know they have value because they be make in the uk we should do all we can to try and protect that be pleased to have put my name to the new clause table by my neighbour in stoke on trent central do he agree notwithstanding his comment that much of this be also about pride it be about pride in our people pride in the skill of our people and pride in the vital ceramic industry not just in stoke on trent central and newcastle under lyme but in many other part of staffordshire as he have note as always my hon friend be absolutely right we in stoke on trent can talk at length about that pride but will not do so today promise although we can talk about our pride that be associate with our industrial heritage rob flello who once serve in this place and be now the chief executive of ceramics uk tell when first meet he that in stoke on trent people think we have slip in our vein slip be the wet clay use for mould cast that be because the ceramics industry in the city be intrinsic to who we be it be an incredibly important part of our heritage but it be also really important part of our future we can make industrial ceramic include those strategic ceramic that go into nuclear submarine and into joint for hip and elbow as well as some of the technical ceramic that be need in steel and glass making in the uk steel and glass can not be make in the uk without ceramic refractory grade ceramic be need because it can withstand heat that would ordinarily melt glass or metal know the minister be well verse on this because have bend his ear on the subject on more occasion that he may have care for the ceramics sector be have tough time but there be hope on the horizon be sure that the industrial strategy will give some relief on energy cost we be keen to encourage people to buy british manufacture good with pride in order to support job in the locality where the industry be dominant new clause simply ask the government to consider the merit of country of origin mark in my constituency there be pride in every piece make in fact in some factory people who make and decorate piece put their initial on the bottom along with the company stamp quite often they can identify their own work in shop because their way of paint and apply transfer be unique to they it become fingerprint new clause encourage people to buy british as my hon friend the members for stoke on trent north david williams for stoke on trent south dr gardner and for newcastle under lyme adam jogee have be the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley of course when people go out and buy that piece of tableware or giftware and be try to do their bit to support our industry if they turn it over and see make in england or make in stoke on trent they should have absolutely confidence that what they be buy be make in those place new clause be purely for probe purpose it be table to get the minister attention and his time yesterday allow to do that know it will not go much far than this but be grateful to the government for their discussion with know the minister have great consideration for the importance of place in the industrial strategy and know from our conversation that he understand why we be push the ceramics line hard in stoke on trent all will say be that as future bills progress we will aim to bring be provision back in other format and way because while this bill may not be the most appropriate place for it there will be other opportunity for it hope that when that time come the government may feel able to support we agree and endorse what the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell say he make logical and coherent point and the bill could be use as vehicle for his suggestion therefore support his new clause and new clause which be of similar ilk however aspect of the bill be democratically dangerous because it gift to government unbridle capacity to make regulation with virtually no oversight from this elect house on matter which touch on not just the sanctity of our product production but the sovereignty of this nation this bill with little attempt at subtlety enable government if so minded this one fear might be to sabotage brexit in many way stand to be correct but do not think single member of this government vote for brexit which be the settle and declare will of the people great number of people who ever participate in democratic vote in this nation yet in the bill we have the capacity particularly through clause to dynamically align all our regulation with those of the eu without have recourse to this house at the whim of the executive whatever the subject matter that surely be most unhealthy situation the hon and learn member be make an important point which be why will support the opposition amendment in this vein today do he agree that the report from the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee in the house of lords be important in bring to light just how skeletal the bill be and be that not reason why we should pay attention we should not always leave it to the house of lords to do our work for we we should have those debate about the future on the floor of this house rather than have thing do by ministerial diktat agree absolutely the house of lords have do some very informative and useful work on the bill only hope that it be not waste on this government but that be my fear have the hon and learn member have time to look at amendment under which if there be any backsliding by the government the matter would be bring back to this house for determination suspect that he like would not accuse ministers of be capable of abuse henry viii power at the moment but those in some future government might that be why we need amendment particularly to ensure that retain eu legislation third of which the previous government bin can and get rid of do not start creep back over month and year take we back to where we begin prior to and effectively take the public for fool agree absolutely no member of this house should glibly pass over clause because it expressly and emphatically set out that regulation which can be make without recourse to this house can provide that product requirement be to be treat as meet if it meet the relevant eu regulation that be indisputably bold platform for dynamically realign this united kingdom in all its regulation with the eu so that we become rule taker that be what fundamentally object to in the bill this house lack of scrutiny power on these matter be make bad by the fact that we no long have the european scrutiny committee if we have that committee we would at least have that opportunity for scrutiny that be why welcome new clause which would require the authority of this house to explore and hopefully ultimately establish committee to scrutinise the regulation be make surely the minimum expectation of anyone democratically elect to this house be that we should have the capacity for oversight challenge and scrutiny of law be make in the name of those we represent although make exclusively by the executive without the consent or process of this house that seem so fundamental to that it would be very sad commentary indeed on the intent behind the bill if new clause be not acceptable to the government if it be not they be say that they want unbridled unchallenged unchallengeable power to make whatever regulation they like despite and in the face of this house the government have say throughout the passage of this legislation that it be not about the european union yet as the hon and learn member make clear it be only the european union that we can align with through regulation make under it do that not fundamentally undermine the government entire argument and show why these amendment be so vital to protect this house absolutely the government tell we when we make trade deal we may be able to ensure the requisite alignment but this bill provide for alignment only with the eu which rather let the cat out of the bag the bill be not about facilitate international trade so that we could in the relevant circumstance align with the united states japan or whoever we be make deal with because it be exclusively and singularly focus on alignment with the eu suspect that be because the purpose of the bill be to advance at the speed of the government choose and without the restraint of this house down the road of dynamic alignment to new clause be very important amendment be key because it will pull the tooth of clause and protect we from the intended course of action strongly support amendment because it would rein in power that need to be rein in and would remove the threat indeed the allegation that the bill be about realignment with the eu couple of week ago we have the so call reset with the eu but the reset be as nothing compare with this bill this bill be the legislative vehicle whereby brexit can be sabotage that be why it be important to address the core issue in clause if the bill be not about secure dynamic alignment with the eu there would be government support for amendment which would make reference to foreign law and not eu law that amendment would put to bed the concern of those of we who believe that the bill be subterfuge to secure realignment with the eu however fear that the government will not support that amendment the legislation be trojan bill it have very clear direction of travel which be to be secure by ignore the question of what power of scrutiny this house should have and by afford to the executive alone the right to realign dynamically with the eu at pace and time and on the content that they alone approve of the bill need these radical amendment include the surgery that amendment would do at the very least it require the semblance of oversight that new clause would provide it give huge pleasure to call our resident metrology expert adam thompson once again it be great honour to speak about the product regulation and metrology bill today we be focus on the amendment propose follow the public bill committee on which in common with the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden be honour to serve be the resident metrologist in committee we hear extensively from member of the opposition they describe in great depth their concern about the bill implication for international alignment of regulation we have just hear some of those concern from the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister today those concern have once again be present to the house through various amendment to the bill will explain with reference to state of the art metrology why those issue should not be significant cause for concern for right hon and hon member the hon member and serve on the bill committee together think he miss slightly important point that this be not about international alignment as be put forward in the amendment table by the opposition but alignment with the eu and that be why there be such concern from the opposition party thank the right hon member for his intervention as discuss extensively during the bill committee there be misunderstanding here of exactly what the bill be do so fundamentally disagree with the point he make but will go into more detail on it in my speech one of the first thing one learn about as bud metrologist be the concept of perfection in his book exactly simon winchester write of what he refer to as the perfectionist detail the evolution of the science of metrology through time and how precision engineering have be use to create the modern world that we inhabit it be great read cover the history of my science in the popular mindset however do not necessarily agree with winchester in his core thesis he talk about metrology as the science of perfection whereas it be more accurate to think of it as the science of the good enough will elaborate on that shortly in the early day of metrologist training we learn that with more money and more time precision engineer can almost always achieve more precise and accurate result whether straight line smoother surface or well piece of legislation but that strive for true perfection the absence of any fault be always folly our resource be never infinite and in the real world it be always more appropriate to strive for the good enough as oppose to the perfect good enough be the core of modern engineering and the fulcrum on which our world balance be as many colleague will know by trade metrologist but within the broad field be surface metrologist surface metrology revolve around the measurement and characterisation of surface surface texture and surface topography be the one who decide whether the leather steering wheel feel right be the one who ensure that car engine distribute and hold oil in all the right place to keep they run smoothly be the one who ensure that tyre keep we firmly plant on the road as we round corner become surface metrologist involve gain an intimate acquaintance with the very concept of perfection always in engineering hear people ask for product to be make perfectly for the angle of the corner of the table to be exactly or for the surface of the microscope to be infinitely smooth let put it on record that there be no such thing as perfection in reality despite what everyone be think be not go to suggest that be perfection but as mathematician may ask my hon friend to accept that the reason perfection be not achievable in that instance be to do with the infinite the infinite amount of number between and for instance or the infinite amount of number between and order accept that we have some expert in the chamber but remind member that speech and intervention must relate to the business at hand and the amendment thank you madam deputy speaker thank my hon friend for his intervention it be perfect he be absolutely right and will leave the perfection to the mathematician to illustrate my point hear people in engineering ask for product to be make perfectly for the angle of the corner of the table to be exactly or the surface of the microscope to be infinitely smooth to study metrology be to understand the concept of imperfection and uncertainty and apply those to everything if one zoom in close enough the angle be never exactly right and the surface be never perfectly smooth on second reading make reference to the optical mirror use in the james webb space telescope they be incredibly smooth yes but to examine they at the atomic scale one would find deviation from the nominal plane that mirror those in the grand canyon be an engineer involve accept these deviation within the context of the work we undertake towards our goal of constant improvement be that in the creation of say aerospace engine or indeed national legislation my expertise within surface metrology be in the development of ray compute tomography for measure surface alongside my good friend dr andy townsend at the university of huddersfield who make similar discovery at the same point in history phenomenon that be common across science be among the first to be able to use ray to measure the interior surface of part that be otherwise hide to both the eye and the machine ray compute tomography have never previously be good enough to measure surface with the imaging resolution achievable lag significantly behind those require to separate measurement from noise previously such measurement be not really need as to manufacture surface one generally have to access that surface with machine tool so one could similarly access it with measurement tool however with the birth of industrial additive manufacturing often call printing we could suddenly make thing with hidden internal geometry that do not need tool access and could not be measure without measurement though we can not verify that the part we make will function as we require they to as such new technology be require to allow we to create additively manufacture part be they novel much light aeroplane part or new joint replacement finely customise to suit the individual alongside our colleague andy and solve this problem by demonstrate that ray compute tomography have become good enough to measure those surface this bill mirror that good enough paradigm current legislation place we at risk of fall out of alignment with the rest of the world which in turn risk our ability as the british to maintain our position at the forefront of international science in its current unamended form the bill grant the secretary of state the necessary authority to keep pace with the guidance of relevant expert the amendment propose by the opposition would only hinder our ability to stay aligned with the continuous advancement of progress in laud the henry viii power in this bill as an elect member of this house be the hon gentleman at ease with the fact that the bill could see criminal offence create without any scrutiny or input from this house be he at ease with the fact that the liberty of our constituent which think we would be interested in protect could be jeopardise by criminal offence create by the executive alone thank the hon and learn member for his intervention but disagree with his assessment this bill be about provide the secretary of state with the power necessary to ensure that we remain at the forefront of science opposition members have incorrectly claim that the bill hand over authority to foreign power or overly centralise it in the hand of the secretary of state this be not matter of cede control to external entity rather it be about maintain the united kingdom position at the forefront of scientific and regulatory innovation it be about ensure that the british scientist who follow in the footstep of newton franklin and hawking can continue to lead the world in their field these opposition amendment appear to stem from fundamental misunderstanding or perhaps complete lack of understanding of what metrology and standard framework entail and why they be vital urge all member to vote against they and support this bill through its third reading remind member that they be speak to the amendment there be to choose from so please keep your contribution appropriate rise today in support of new clause which deal with country of origin mark for ceramic product and which my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell so eloquently introduce my constituency be home to the great pottery throw down base in the wonderful gladstone pottery museum in longton and be so proud to have many great pottery firm in my constituency those include wedgwood which be fame for its iconic blue jasperware and duchess china which have factory in longton and newstead that be honour to visit recently there meet jason simms who be mph visionary for the future of ceramic in stoke on trent and the world it be really interesting visit duchess found in produce the tableware use in the house of commons it be proud of the fact that its product be make in the uk from clay to table people buy product produce by duchess for example will see that they say on the bottom fine bone china make in staffordshire the phrasing be deliberate it clearly inform the purchaser not only of the product country of origin but the precise part of the country that it come from most of our ceramic product contain these backstamp to mark authenticity and many include reference to stoke and staffordshire as have before invite all colleague to join the turnover club and check the backstamp on the chinaware here they will probably find it be make in stoke my hon friend be make an excellent point just for the record some of the tableware in the members dining room be in fact german hope everyone will get behind campaign to replace it thank my hon friend for that timely and right intervention join he in his campaign we do not always have the level of detail need in this country and we need to address that nuance so that consumer know exactly what they be buy that be important because the pottery industry be at great risk from cheap import which be undermine our british make product and create unfair competition for our well quality product make in our own country this china dumping of product often falsely pretend to be make by our staffordshire firm dunoon be one example must be stop we must back our british industry and our british worker and do what we can to resist such unfair competition have stoke tableware in my home completely understand the argument that the hon member be make so will she join in the lobby in vote for new clause to support uk labelling for manufacture product that be for not just stoke tableware but far afield too the hon member be right to point out that stoke and staffordshire be not the only place that produce wonderful ceramic and other product understand that new clause be broad in scope be speak today to new clause which relate to ceramic hope he will indulge few month ago be proud to meet gmb representative for the british pottery industry here in parliament along with my hon friend the members for stoke on trent north david williams and for stoke on trent central gareth snell that include the formidable sharon yates who be one of my constituent they have real pride real passion and real skill in what they do thank my hon friend and neighbour for give way she be eloquently outline the real skill and talent of our people who make world class ceramic echo her support for new clause bring forward by my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell recently meet the gmb union and worker who have sadly be make redundant at the iconic moorcroft pottery in my constituency of stoke on trent north and kidsgrove collectively the people in that room have more than year of hone skill and expertise do my hon friend agree that we must do all we can to protect our pot include backstampe our ceramic product as outline in new clause commend my hon friend for his outstanding advocacy in particular for the worker of moorcroft know how hard he have be work for they and agree that they be testament to the great skilled craftsman and woman in british manufacturing stoke on trent the potteries and staffordshire be globally renowned for our chinaware and tableware we stand tall among the like of limoges in france and delft in the netherlands and we must ensure that we protect that status we be celebrate stoke on trent anniversary this year and work towards unesco creative city status hence urge ministers and the government to demonstrate their pride and support for this globally renowned industry by support new clause it be pleasure to follow my colleague from stoke who have so powerfully advocate for their local community it be also an absolute pleasure to be part of debate with my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson who genuinely believe should be knight for his service to explain what metrology be to all of we at the very least he should have some kind of bbc four series possibly with my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince as his sidekick be here because have table new clause which have cross party support it be design to be probe amendment hope the minister be reassure about that because these be important parliamentary matter agree with opposition members that this bill be an important piece of legislation although come at it from different perspective because see it as be at the sharp end of brexit to brexit be paperwork because there be multiple regulatory regime our constituent and particularly small business must deal with the ream and ream of paperwork that have come from leave the european union in the way we do and we know that have have an impact on they we know that over small business have give up export to the european union because of all the extra paperwork that one in eight small exporter have temporarily or permanently stop sell to the eu and that another be consider do so because it have become more complicated this piece of legislation will affect over business in our constituency because it will hopefully help to start deal with the paperwork mountain that be the product of brexit it make no sense at all to ask people to follow two set of rule when one of those set be perfectly functional opposition members should be honest and admit that because their own attempt to run two separate regulatory regime fall so flat we see that with the uk conformity assessment which the previous government originally try to introduce in december because it be such disaster and be create so much extra cost and paperwork for small business it keep get delay until may when the then government finally admit defeat and claim that any business in the uk that have meet the european charter mark have also meet the uk charter mark they do that because it would have cost business up to billion over the next decade to try to run two separate lot of conformity assessment for the very product regulation whose operation we be talk about today this bill matter very much for our constituent for small business and for the job that it create but get this right also matter to the government because business need certainty and stability in their regulatory regime and the government need to be functional in their review of they as the hon lady appreciate we come at this bill from different angle we have table some amendment include amendment which would require the secretary of state to come to this house and make statement as the hon lady say small business be see regulatory change happen so swiftly that they can not keep up one issue with the bill be the fact that it will be possible for regulation to be change even more quickly at the stroke of minister pen that could lead to small and medium sized enterprise be disadvantage compare with very large business which can align much more quickly the right hon member have the luxury and benefit of be on the public bill committee do not have the ability to ask the question that he be ask but look at the evidence under the previous administration when there be the ability to diverge what actually happen the reality be that very little divergence happen because it be not in our national interest we can and do fight many thing in this place indeed in british politic but geography really be not one of the thing that it be worth our time argue about give that we do five time more trade with our european union neighbour than with america china and india put together it obviously make sense to have regulatory regime that make that trade as friction free as possible which be where this piece of legislation come in indeed under the previous government there be only five case of active divergence the sort of change that the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden be worried about that might affect small business that be with good reason because if we have sensible regulatory regime it make sense to be align the prime minister have talk about that and it be also what business want the engineering and machinery alliance which represent over firm from different trade association put it very simply it say that our business be trade in european market and be part of european value chain they have european customer and supplier for company operate in highly specialised high value market the uk be unlikely to provide the mass need to develop and successfully market their product they need to be international and that mean work to international standard the eu being almost always the most appropriate do the hon lady agree that the tory reform brexit have be complete disaster for our economy can not even look you in the eye madam deputy speaker because know should not be tempt into quite that level of analysis very practically we be try to deal with the fallout of brexit the hon member will have hear say that we need salvage operation because of the consequence see and the damage do as result of the way that our leave the european union be conduct see this bill as part of that salvage operation we use to be part of write such regulation with our colleague in europe which we do not do any more but we need process to maintain they because of the reality of the supply chain of how we do business and of where divergence have hit small business and it be small business in every single constituency that have pay the price for this version of brexit take that as yes the hon member can take it as yes but he will know that be stick very closely to the amendment because want to come on to how we make such decision first though we need to be clear that this legislation will affect the life of our constituent let give one example be child of the remember the glo worm thank you madam deputy speaker for look surprised hope it be look of surprise but perhaps you be remember the glo worm yourself the point be that the glo worm turn out to be quite dangerous toy because of the chemical it contain regulation help to keep we safe so when we be talk about share regulatory regime and be able to promote market there be good reason why we be seek high standard hope that everyone will hold the glo worm as an example it have now be reissue without those chemical in it thank goodness so that child of the can enjoy those squidgy toy what matter be how we make decision about such regulation and the debate on this bill herald big conversation that we need to have in parliament about how we can be involve in those decision now that we be not part of the european union obviously agrifood and sanitary and phytosanitary good be not include in the bill but the government have now commit to dynamic alignment with eu rule for very common sense reason as the prime minister have say we be currently align in our standard but we do not get the benefit of that we want to continue to have high standard that be what the british public report may vol hope that be the ethos we take in how we use the power in this bill it be certainly what business would like we to do will the hon lady give way will happily give way although promise madam deputy speaker that be about to turn to new clause the hon lady make an important point but on the broad issue of dynamic alignment be there not some issue for example animal welfare which be not cover by the bill on which if we want to maintain high standard we will want to go far than our eu ally not dynamically align with they the right hon member seem to believe the regulatory regime we have be ceiling rather than floor there be nothing to prevent we from have high standard they be about maintain standard he and be on different side of the debate about nutrient neutrality but the concern be about the high standard when it come to protect our river and sea from algae that be at risk under the previous government the right hon member be right though to raise the question of how we maintain standard which be where new clause come in it be about the concept of how we take back control which frankly be at the heart of all the brexit debate be sure the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister be surprised that have become the stop clock for he this be one point in his political career that may be right there be challenge here that we need to address and those of we who come to the brexit debate from different direction can all agree that it be good and healthy to have such discussion also want to say as parliamentarian that the government should be direct to do something that have consequence for parliament as well that be where new clause be come from it be probe amendment to raise more general concern about how we make good legislation at the beginning of this parliament the government decide not to re establish the european scrutiny committee which have exist since to scrutinise european document that affect uk policy or law in the debate the leader of the house say that the principal job of the committee to examine the document produce by the eu institution that the government would automatically take on board be no long require official report july vol the challenge for many of we be that this bill and indeed the deal we now have with the european union mean that that test be be set again there be now need for some form of dedicated scrutiny mechanism with specialist expert staff to consider relevant eu law and rule that be not confine to the issue arise from this bill it be broad point about what be happen now the esc work primarily by examine proposal from the european commission and give an opinion on their implication and when they would affect matter of principle policy or law in the uk recognise that since that committee be abolish some work on these issue have be do by other committees and that be welcome however with this bill and the reset deal we be move to volume of european law and regulation with such technical complexity that we in this place would be well serve by have that specialist expertise let be honest many of these thing be beyond our individual pay grade and we will want some expert assistance put simply if pram be pass in its current form where the government choose to recognise eu product regulation there will again be document produce by eu institution that the government would automatically take on board the government dashboard of assimilate eu law show that there be item in the area of product safety and standard that derive from european law and could under pram be influence by proposal of the european commission to update eu law clearly document alone would likely mean we exceed the ability of any one individual departmental select committee to devote sufficient time to the require level of scrutiny give their other priority many of we have run in with the previous member for stone for some reason he never quite welcome my interest in his work but my interest and concern in scrutiny in this place be genuine and heartfelt because do think that at our good we can help ministers although know that some on the front bench maybe on both side of the chamber will be raise an eyebrow at that suggestion aside from the democratic merit of parliamentary scrutiny in its own right and the cry to take back control there be number of benefit to the government of ensure that regulation derive from eu law be scrutinise closely not least because if those regulation derive from eu law be later the subject of judicial review the quality of parliamentary scrutiny of the relevant secondary legislation would be factor into court think on the adequacy of the government decision making we might also pick up thing in the process that have be miss it be indeed the question of perfection as my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson say to argue that any government or any individual scrutiny process through statutory instrument could ever be perfect do not believe we should set that standard as psychologist believe in compete opinion and view there be always merit in have second pair of eye that be what this process be get at that be how we get close to perfection if have understand my lesson in metrology correctly the point also fit within the broad debate about how as we reset our relationship with europe we make sure that we show the british public our homework that be ultimately what good scrutiny do it defeat the naysayer who claim that there be backroom fix it allow the disinfectant of sunlight to be pour on every single document to its dull degree as the prime minister tell the house in present the european deal we will be take co operation with europe far step by step and alignment will be an important part of that welcome that because it be in the interest of the british public we be already commit to dynamic alignment on the sps deal to free we from those dire border check and all the extra paperwork that mean that there be truck stick at sevington food inflation have increase and our constituent have pay the price we be also look at dynamic alignment on emission trading to allow we to remove energy tariff in key industry include steel that mean that when those deal be complete there will be much large volume of eu rule that directly affect uk law and policy that will probably be good thing but it be right for this place to be able to debate discuss and scrutinise how that work hope the minister will recognise that every single political party in this house have support new clause because they want not to batter the government but to engage with the government on these issue and that he will talk about how we can see the appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny in this piece of legislation recognise that not many piece of legislation will be affect by the pram proposal directly but there be that broad point about how we take back control how we have that conversation about the way in which we at our good can assist the government to get the good out of regulation so that our business can keep trading our consumer can keep buy and our glo worms can keep glow be grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly in this debate be not sure that would depend on timing of the business of the house have the pleasure today of welcome doreen and eric moyse to parliament this year they both celebrate their birthday and be sure colleague will join in send our good wish to they there be five mps from north staffordshire and we be all here proud member of the turnover club and champion of our ceramics industry we have all contribute to the debate both through make speech and in intervention and be grateful to you madam deputy speaker for your guidance on the amendment and for remind we to speak to they be very grateful to the hon gentleman just want to make sure that all five member from north staffordshire make their voice know on the record support he wholeheartedly in his speech that be my kind of friend be very grateful to the right hon lady for her intervention which speak to the cross party support for our ceramics industry grateful to she for place that on the record there be two adams in the parliamentary labour party my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson and he be old than but there be only one metrologist so although enjoy his speech will not attempt to repeat it but do enjoy he share his experience of test leather standard madam deputy speaker laughter will leave that there will speak briefly in support of new clause which stand in the name of my hon friend and constituency neighbour the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell and in the name of our hon friend the members for stafford leigh ingham for stoke on trent north david williams for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier for stoke on trent south dr gardner and for amber valley linsey farnsworth we hear very good speech from my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central be grateful to he for take my intervention in which focus on pride that be what will talk about very briefly now the home of the ceramic industry in staffordshire be something that local people in newcastle under lyme and across the county be very proud of man and woman who have show their skill prowess knowledge and talent since the century on occasion madam deputy speaker we hear the odd speech in this chamber that remind we of the century recently be very lucky to have the opportunity to visit silverdale bathrooms which specialise in the high quality handmade ceramic and be base in my constituency the skill to produce the work have be pass down through many generation the quality of british ceramic be the good in the world and we should not be afraid to claim it show it off and celebrate it all year round that be why new clause be so important notwithstanding my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central confirm that it be more of probe amendment intend to get some time with the minister that be excellent advice for new back bencher like madam deputy speaker so shall leave the chamber to start draft some of my own probe amendment to the various bills before parliament new clause be an amendment that hope few colleague will disagree with proudly wear the flag of our united kingdom on my lapel from what have gather think be make in the united kingdom that detailed conversation have obviously never take place and want the same for the ceramics industry design produce and root in newcastle under lyme and staffordshire interruption too right stop right there too pay tribute to my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north for the work he have do to support the worker at moorcroft new clause speak to our ceramics industry we need this labour government to step up and deliver real support for our ceramics industry from crippling energy and gas cost to ensure the ceramics industry be at the heart of our approach to trade we have much to do step up with action not word will be good for the job and livelihood of the people of newcastle under lyme and across the county of staffordshire good for uk plc and good for our ceramics industry new clause be step in the right direction and it have my support it be an honour to speak in this debate on the product regulation and metrology bill and in particular the amendment table by the public bill committee be not on the committee some might say do not measure up interruption my parliamentary assistant have ask to point out that write that joke not she pay tribute to my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson follow his contribution on second reading do take away his slide on metrology and find they particularly interesting as former math teacher be sure he will recognise that without math there would be no metrology wish to speak to number of amendment as be our role in this house will briefly touch on new clause because want to pay tribute to my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell every time the ceramics industry be mention by anyone in the house know there be an intervention come in all sincerity his passion in stand up for the ceramics industry in stoke should be respect by member across the house business claim that they make their product in england or in stoke when they do not be not only dishonest they also damage the industry that do make their product there we all want to support our local industry wherever possible sadly do not go around buy lot of fibre optic cable although if do would do so proudly as the fibre optic cable be invent by george hockham and charles kao in my constituency of harlow the bill be an important piece of legislation that will update the uk product safety regulation and metrology framework some be sceptical on second reading but clause point out that it will not stop have pint or for my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson cubic decimetre of beer at the willow the white admiral or any of the other moth relate pub in harlow regulation be only effective with enforcement so welcome the inclusion of the clause on enforcement would also welcome little more detail from the minister in his sum up if possible on the regulation and how we will ensure it be effective would also be grateful if the minister could touch on cost recovery which be obviously important for the relevant authority to impose these regulation will briefly touch on new clause for which my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy advocate so well she be correct to say that stability be hugely important for uk business and she be also right to say that we do five time as much trade with the eu as with any of our other trading partner as say in recent opposition day debate business in harlow would absolutely welcome breaking down of those barrier to trade with the eu also welcome my hon friend comment on the importance of scrutiny by this house joke with mr speaker yesterday that do come to this chamber quite often to talk about thing in my constituency believe it or not but one of the most important role of elect official whether on the government or opposition benches be scrutiny the hon member for epping forest dr hudson know how much scrutinise legislation be grateful to my constituency neighbour for give way what we have in common be that he will stand up for his business in harlow and will try to stand up for my business in epping forest much of the debate today and some of the amendment touch on scrutiny the hon gentleman be move on to the power of this house to scrutinise regulation small and medium sized business in our country be face huge pressure and not just with regulation but with the economic climate set by this labour government through the job tax measure such as new clause be seek to rein in some of the power that the executive be try to take on board which will enable they to change regulation on whim and then create more uncertainty for business do the hon gentleman agree that these sensible amendment would enable more scrutiny from this house and actually make the climate well for the business that we really want to champion thank my neighbour for his intervention we both recognise the importance of championing business in our constituency although be sure he would recognise that business in harlow be well than those in epping forest that be joke apology madam deputy speaker would the hon gentleman just correct the record on that will pre empt the point of order business in epping forest and in harlow be equally very good and very successful will now move on disagree slightly with the hon gentleman on the reason for the economic challenge when have speak to business in harlow it be clear that we need to break down the barrier to trade with the eu that have be create however as also say in recent debate do not intend to rehash the same old argument we have have over brexit it be about how we work with where we be at the moment and think the trade deal that the prime minister and the business secretary have secure on that be really positive this be part of that alignment and think it be very positive just to finish will welcome the response from the minister on some of the point that have be raise today have absolute confidence in the secretary of state to ensure that he get the good for british business business in epping forest and in harlow call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be real pleasure to take part in this debate on product regulation and metrology not least because it give the opportunity to highlight the work do by my former colleague at the national physical laboratory in teddington which be the uk home of metrology would like to set the mind of the hon member for erewash adam thompson at rest he be still as far as know the only metrologist with whom have work in finance department but nevertheless as non scientist it give real admiration for the work of scientist in this particular area in teddington they be set the standard they be develop and maintain the primary measurement standard for the uk and across the world what would like to say to the chamber this afternoon and to my constituent in the neighbouring constituency of richmond park be that if they have be inspire by the hon member for erewash and have have fire ignite in they for the science of metrology the national physical laboratory be have its open day this friday june and everyone should go along be grateful to the hon lady for give way it be lovely to hear of her experience be aware that she be previously at the national physical laboratory indeed recall how excited my field be when she be first elect would just like to place strongly on the record how much agree with her colleague excellent contribution to science follow that hymn of praise to metrology will now turn to the amendment the liberal democrats welcome many of the measure propose in the bill the legislation seek to balance consumer safety economic growth and regulatory flexibility ensure that uk law can keep pace with technological advancement we support enhance consumer protection for those product that pose safety risk to consumer as well as the importance of corporate responsibility for business operate in online marketplace the liberal democrats support the need to update the regulatory framework and we be glad that the bill take step to address this however step must be take to level the play field between online and high street business and to protect consumer as such we have table new clause and and amendment which work toward that aim equally the liberal democrats remain concerned by the bill reliance on secondary legislation and the overuse of henry viii power give ministers excessive discretion to repeal or amend primary legislation through regulation all product and metrology regulation should be subject to the affirmative procedure and we seek to ensure that the bill be ambitious in provide proper parliamentary scrutiny there should also be great engagement and consultation requirement mean that key stakeholder may not be adequately consider in regulatory change this lack of consultation feed more broadly into our apprehension about the burden that some measure will place on small business and as such we have table new clause and which acknowledge this and would provide support to small and local business wish to speak in favour of new clause which would place requirement on large supermarket to inform customer when the quantity of good within the product have decrease result in price increase per unit of measurement research by compare the market find that product such as digestive biscuit have become small yet the price have rise by compare with decade ago outrageous it be outrageous yes similar situation have be see with popular household item such as coco pops butter and crisp we be glad to see that while the bill be in the other chamber the government accept liberal democrat amendment prevent change to the pint as recognise measurement for beer cider and milk through regulation under the bill however hope the government will go far and expand this safeguard to protect consumer by accept this amendment also wish to speak in favour of new clause which would require the government to undertake review into the feasibility of ask large hospitality business to disclose the country of origin of meat product on menu the farming industry have be push for clear labelling of the origin of food for some time previous research by the national farmers union have show that of consumer be more likely to visit venue that claim that its ingredient be source from british farmer and almost of consumer agree it be important that the sourcing of food in venue be transparent farmer across the country be grapple with the punitive family farm tax introduce by this government and continue to cope with the challenge impose by trade deal under the last conservative government well labelling of british produce on the menu of large restaurant would give crucial support to farmer and their business and hope that the government will support this new clause as step towards achieve that more broadly urge the government to support new clause which intend to push to vote thank the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell and his neighbouring staffordshire mps really enjoy listen to he speak about the manufacture of ceramic he speak eloquently about the importance of uk manufacturing and most importantly the sense of place that it evoke and the pride that local people can feel in product produce in their town city region or neighbourhood so many consumer want labelling of uk product because they know that would be quality mark and as the hon gentleman say it would allow the expression of pride in their town and city if the government accept our new clause it would require they to establish voluntary labelling scheme under which good be clearly mark as be produce or manufacture in the uk that would help the consumer to make an informed choice and make it easy for the government to support domestic producer the new clause would also set up promotional campaign to ensure that consumer be aware of the scheme have spend the last five year grapple with the bureaucracy of brexit increase trading cost and the ongoing cost of living crisis business owner will be deeply concerned by the additional challenge come from washington we need to bring the country together and collectively show that we will not take trump tariff lie down but will rally behind our business at home and work with our commonwealth and european ally abroad as specify in new clause in set up the campaign we urge the government to consult with british business and trade group such as industry leader make in britain which recently say that it have see surge in membership follow the introduction of tariff as more business be focus on british manufacturing representation and promotion countless people across the uk wish to buy british champion our local business and support our high street and this new clause would be key step in support they to do so would very much welcome all staffordshire mps join we in the voting lobby this afternoon thank the hon lady for her kind word about the amendment and the work that my colleague be do my only point be that the final paragraph under subsection of new clause would allow such labelling where the final significant production process occur in the uk but that be one of the thing that we be try to clamp down on in ceramic production product that be bisque fire outside the uk then bring into the uk for gloss firing be pass off as be make in the uk we argue that this should not be the case the full process from clay to table should take place in the uk while have absolute sympathy with she on her new clause that subsection unfortunately would not address the issue in fact it could do further damage to our industry if she be happy to we could discuss that outside this place be sure that there be area of commonality on which we could work together thank the hon gentleman for that further information about the ceramics industry which now feel so much well inform about he make valuable point when we talk about thing be make in the uk what exactly do that mean how can we use that valuable designation to well support our domestic industry thank he for that further clarification liberal democrats support the need to update the regulatory framework for the uk marketplace to reduce trade friction and give business and consumer confidence in their product we be glad that many of the measure in the bill will have that effect but we remain concerned about the excessive ministerial discretion in this legislation and the reliance on secondary legislation we will continue to push the government to strengthen scrutiny mechanism and for fairer regulation for online marketplace crucially hope the government will take this opportunity to support british business by support new clause give consumer great transparency and british business the boost that they need call the shadow minister may say what an interesting debate this have be have huge amount of sympathy for the case that have be put for new clause which be make in very coherent way also have great sympathy for the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy and her propose new clause will explain how our amendment would address some of the issue she have speak about the liberal democrat amendment and new clause in particular make great deal of sense the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister table range of amendment that cover point make in his majesty loyal opposition amendment which will come to we should ask ourselves why this relatively small and technical bill have attract nearly amendment on report it be because as be say it be trojan horse bill we table our amendment because the bill do lot more behind the scene than appear on the surface when in the voter of britain on an turnout vote to leave the european union it create an opportunity for the country to tailor our regulatory regime to good fit british industry and to set global standard so that it be easy to do business the uk product regulation and metrology as we hear from our resident metrologist the hon member for erewash adam thompson once set the standard for the world and indeed have the chance to do so again when in government the conservatives start the work of capitalise on that opportunity we see the bill as terrible step back and trojan horse because it will tie we to eu red tape on which we have no say the hon member for harlow chris vince speak about his hope for business in harlow through this trojan horse bill labour will restrict britain innovator with over burdensome regulation mean that british industry will fall behind international competitor as we hear the liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for richmond park sarah olney say when speak to her amendment it be prime example of skeleton bill there be two major area of concern for his majesty loyal opposition the use of sweep henry viii power and the ability to dynamically align by the back door with the european union will speak to the amendment we have table to address those concern when the bill start its passage the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee in the other place find that the power in the bill particularly in clause be excessive and it recommend that they be remove many of our amendment address those element of clause in the other place the government water down the bill follow those criticism but afterwards the bill be still describe as skeleton bill that shift power to an unacceptable extent as recently as february the committee in the other place say that the amendment make in the other place be limited change that do not address the fundamental concern we have about the skeletal nature of this bill the government have not take the opportunity to add flesh to the bone of this skeleton bill it remain the case that the bill provide for almost all of the substance of the regulatory regime for product safety and metrology to be provide for by ministers in regulation while we acknowledge that the current secretary of state may act responsibly we do not want to put thing on the statute book that future minister might treat differently we all agree that strong consistent product safety rule be need and we acknowledge the risk from online marketplace and unsafe import but we do not think that the bill be the right way to deal with that we also think that parliament must retain proper oversight so amendment and seek to remove the broad power grant to the secretary of state in clause clause be of equal concern because it grant the secretary of state sweep power to create new criminal offence create new complexity in our criminal justice system it also allow ministers to create civil sanction for non compliance with product and metrology regulation through secondary legislation reduce parliamentary scrutiny of an issue that be incredibly important for our constituent freedom the clause also allow the government to introduce new penalty and even prison sentence new power of entry and new fine on business which will drive up the cost of do business our amendment seek to change those element we believe that such serious offence should be subject to considerably more parliamentary scrutiny that be why amendment seek to ensure that new criminal offence that could have consequence for the ministry of justice and the criminal justice system be not create through new product regulation under the bill do the hon lady agree that it be quite astounding that among the criminal offence that be anticipate be make by the minister without parliamentary scrutiny be indictable offence which could result in people lose their liberty for whatever period be specify in the offence be that not retrograde departure from the standard of oversight that any citizen would expect member elect to this house to exercise agree we all know the type of people be let of prison by this government it be total scandal that suddenly person can be imprison for perhaps inadvertently have product in stock that have not follow dynamic alignment process that have not be very visible to parliament that be why hope that the whole house will support amendment in the lobby amendment and seek clarification of the function that may be confer on relevant authority and the power that may be grant to inspector the phrase relevant authority be use throughout the bill and it be not entirely clear what all such authority might be in clause we once again see henry viii power be use despite the concern raise in the other place amendment would therefore add to clause and require that any regulation make under the legislation that amend or replace primary legislation be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure be sure all parliamentarian will want to support that amendment be sure the minister will come back on that point and say you can trust we and you can trust this government do the shadow minister agree however that this government may not always be in power and that the power they be create for themselves may be hand down to someone less responsible in future wholeheartedly endorse that it be the principle we do not know what executive we will hand this power to in future the current executive be ask for the power but we be democracy and the executive can change at every single election it would be wrong for parliament to give away its power in the way that be propose in this legislation that be why hope that everyone will support our amendment remember sit through many debate on bills in the last parliament in which member of the labour party then in opposition talk about the importance of parliamentary scrutiny do my hon friend agree that the amendment table by his majesty opposition be all about improve and bolster parliamentary scrutiny and that government members have nothing to fear by give more power to this house my hon friend be so wise and so insightful in fact the secretary of state for business and trade himself say in opposition we must bear in mind that the use of delegate power carry risk of abuse by the executive which be not something the opposition could ever support rather it be our duty at this stage to check the power of the executive and ensure that we be not give they carte blanche to change the balance of power permanently in their favour official report taxation cross border trade public bill committee public bill committee february that be exactly what they be ask for in this bill and why we urge member to support our amendment it be not just the secretary of state who say this let we listen to what our friend the attorney general of this great united kingdom lord hermer another member of his majesty government have say on henry viii clause skeleton legislation and delegate power he say that they strike not only at the rule of law but also at the cardinal principle of accessibility and legal certainty and yet we be be ask this evening to allow criminal sanction and the possibility of imprisonment to go through use those power amendment would remove the ability for product regulation to provide that product requirement be meet if the requirement of relevant eu law be meet we believe that the uk as an independent nation should set its own product regulation to foster innovation and support domestic industry and not automatically align with eu rule over which we no long have any influence and do not help to shape the second area in which we have table further amendment be that of dynamic alignment we have hear the hon member for harlow chris vince admit that that be the very purpose of this bill we believe that dynamic alignment with eu regulation should be decision for the house to make and that interpretation must only be undertake by uk court not by international court such as the european commission or the court of justice of the european union we take back those very power but in this bill the secretary of state be take the power to give they away our amendment would remove the secretary of state ability to make regulation about the marketing or use of product in the united kingdom which correspond or be similar to provision of relevant eu law for the purpose of reduce or mitigate the environmental impact of product our amendment to would specifically require parliamentary approval for align product regulation with eu law our amendment state that interpretation and enforcement of any regulation must only be undertake by uk court we as his majesty loyal opposition also want to ensure that regulation under this bill do not damage any other international agreement that the government may wish to strike so our new clause on international agreement would ensure that any regulation make under the bill power do not undermine the uk exist or future trade deal include with key partner such as the us india japan australia and canada that be pragmatic and necessary step towards maintain the strength of the uk trade relationship and protect the long term prosperity of our business the government have talk many time about growth be their top priority so this new clause would ensure that regulation make under the bill prioritise economic growth amendment would require the secretary of state to actively promote investment innovation and economic growth through product regulation it embed forward look vision position the uk as global leader in innovation and ensure that our regulatory framework support prosperity and not just compliance when this bill leave the other place the lead minister in the other place lord leong say we have take the bill from its early state to where it be today and obviously it will now go to the other place be sure that the noble lord be right there will be further deliberation on the bill and hopefully we will get it to well place official report house of lords march vol and yet there have not be significant change in committee therefore recommend that the house support our amendment in the lobby this evening thank all hon member for contribute to the debate my hon friend the members for stoke on trent central gareth snell for stoke on trent south dr gardner for newcastle under lyme adam jogee for walthamstow ms creasy for harlow chris vince for erewash adam thompson the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for richmond park sarah olney and the shadow minister the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin will address many of the point they raise during the debate welcome the liberal democrat spokesperson to her new role do not know whether it be promotion or demotion but welcome she all the same as always it be pleasure to hear from my hon friend the member for erewash and his great technical insight indeed we have our own professor yaffle in his house those of certain age will know who be refer to his expertise be greatly appreciate in bill committee and again today amendment and would remove clause from the bill of course that be the central power to keep consumer safe and our product regulation update as say in committee our product regulation framework be extensive we have hundred of often technical regulation remove clause would freeze our regulation in time we would be unable to respond to new risk product or business model can not accept an amendment that would stop we from protect consumer and business from product relate harm the minister talk about protect consumer that be exactly what new clause would do by make they aware when product get small but the price remain the same shrinkflation so will he work with we and get that clause into law will address new clause in due course that be more consumer relate issue than product safety one but understand the intent behind it we have hear lot of concern many of they misplace about the breadth of power contain within the bill in the other place we do increase the measure that will be subject to the affirmative procedure we remove several henry viii clause and add statutory consultation requirement we also publish code of conduct available in the library of the house which set out exactly how the power under the bill will be use now believe the bill strike the right balance of appropriate parliamentary scrutiny without clog up parliamentary time with highly technical product regulation gutte the bill by remove the central power would leave consumer unprotected amendment to to and all relate to eu law want to be absolutely clear yet again that the power in the bill give the uk the flexibility to manage its own product regulatory framework part of that be of course ensure that the uk can respond to relevant development in eu law it do not mean that the uk be beholden to eu change and all regulation will be subject to parliament oversight also wish to reassure the house that the government remain committed to our obligation under the windsor framework the reason the bill explicitly reference the eu rather than other jurisdiction be that most of our product regulation be of course inherit from eu law the uk continue to recognise certain eu product requirement policy that be of course enact under the previous government only month ago the bill power allow we to continue or end such recognition base on the uk interest on case by case basis decision on whether to diverge or align will be make as they come along and will only be implement by lay statutory instrument in parliament recognition of eu product requirement would be state in uk law and could only be enforce by uk authority the bill do not grant jurisdiction to foreign court find amendment which would prevent ce recognition an odd amendment to be push by the conservatives give that they introduce regulation only year ago that do the absolute opposite new clause and and amendment and deal with theme of eu law parliamentary scrutiny and oversight these amendment duplicate the robust safeguard already in the bill and the statutory and non statutory control that we have publish in our code of conduct those include the statutory requirement for consultation and assessment under the well regulation framework the government value parliament role in scrutinise legislation so we will continue to consult all the devolve government as appropriate to ensure that regulation work for the whole of the uk let turn to amendment and on parliamentary scrutiny the bill as introduce already apply the affirmative procedure in key area include the creation of criminal offence contrary to what have be say this afternoon and amend primary legislation however in response to matter raise by the dprrc we have add additional area which be set out in clause for the avoidance of doubt can confirm that the affirmative procedure apply to the following the creation of criminal offence the first use of regulation cover online marketplace the first time duty be impose on new supply chain actor regulation confer power of entry search or inspection regulation to disapply requirement in response to an emergency regulation cover the sharing of information between person regulation on cost recovery regulation amend or repeal the gun barrel proof act consequential amendment to primary legislation and regulation amend the definition of online marketplace do the minister agree that online marketplace should have great responsibility to ensure the safety and authenticity of the product they sell just like retailer on our high street absolutely agree and that be one reason why the bill have be introduce we absolutely need to keep up to date with development in the online marketplace world which be why we have introduce this legislation it be not as have be suggest an unbridled use of power it set out clear set of principle and provide for the use of the affirmative procedure in most case there be already number of regulation that will be transpose as they stand there be about page of product regulation include to do with noise level emit from certain type of machinery and the ergonomic design of personal protective equipment increase the list of regulation subject to the affirmative procedure to cover such matter risk mire parliament in level of technicality that think only my hon friend the member for erewash could follow do not think that be good use of parliamentary time and believe the opposition use to think that too which be why the power in the consumer protection act which be similar to what we be deal with today remain in place under successive government will deal now with new clause table by my hon friend the member for walthamstow she raise some important point and thank she for set out the rationale behind her new clause so clearly first reassure the house that we be not look at the same level of regulatory change that be necessitate when we leave the eu we anticipate no more than half dozen us of the power year that be because the fundamental of the regulatory framework be already in uk law thousand of page as have refer to and many of those provision have be through previous scrutiny process the majority of future change use the power in the bill will be small and technical recognise the concern raise though when we be member of the eu directive enact major regulatory change be regularly transpose into uk law use the negative procedure our bill contain many more safeguard than be in place before mean that the affirmative procedure will be use far more often as have set out careful consideration be give in the development of the power to ensure that we strike the right balance between good use of parliamentary time and the processing of highly technical change we listen to the concern raise by member of the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee and go far broaden the area require scrutiny as have set out as lord pannick say the practical reality be that technical regulation of the breadth and complexity that will be produce can not sensibly be enact by primary legislation if we use primary legislation every time we want to do something on product safety we would have little time for anything else however to provide maximum transparency in this space we also publish code of conduct set out the statutory and non statutory guardrail in place before regulation can be make that include statement on how we will engage and consult with wide range of stakeholder to ensure that their view be consider we will continue to review and update the code of conduct and of course we will be happy to take suggestion on how we can be clear about parliament role in the scrutiny of regulation give those assurance believe we have strike the right balance between scrutiny the appropriate use of parliamentary time and the flexibility need to keep our product and metrology regulation up to date hope that give my hon friend the member for walthamstow some reassurance thank the minister for set that out it be incredibly helpful and reassure to many of we to hear that in this instance just handful of regulation would be affect hope that business ministers have hear the wide call for we to look at the issue across the piece in fact be sure that the minister will want to feed that in what he say be very welcome and be sure that all hon member who support my new clause will be reassure accordingly be sure that ministers across government will have hear the important point that my hon friend have make today amendment on consumer protection could have unintended consequence as product safety be not one dimensional it require consideration of multiple risk and consumer and business need for example we be undertake significant programme of work consider furniture safety and the balance between fire risk and the possible effect of exposure to chemical flame retardant be the amendment adopt we would be open to challenge by any interest group unhappy with how regulation balance those factor indeed when give that example in committee the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson say that it be compelling reason for not accept the amendment so hope the hon member for richmond park will not move that amendment amendment and on the circular economy be unnecessary as the environment act already require the government to consider the environmental impact of any new policy and the consumer rights act include provision on right to repair on new clause the government be commit to meet our obligation on the uk trade agreement and nothing in the bill will contradict that new clause and relate to small and medium sized business the purpose of new clause be already meet through exist practice and that of new clause be also meet as all regulation will be assess in line with the well regulation framework principle similarly amendment on economic growth be unnecessary all regulation will be subject to statutory consultation and require an impact assessment as per the well regulation framework ensure that business need be fully consider the bill will allow great simplification and clarity on product requirement which should ease burden on industry let turn to amendment and new clause on online marketplace and supply chain agree that all relevant actor must be capture by our regulatory framework that be why we have explicitly recognise and define online marketplace in the bill as well as include clause to ensure that any other person engage in activity relate to product can be bring within scope include those work in fulfilment house at the early opportunity we intend to consult on requirement apply to online marketplace that protect consumer and be proportionate to the range of marketplace business model the bill give we the opportunity to develop appropriate requirement follow consultation that be well than require the introduction of specific obligation irrespective of the outcome of consultation and consideration of proportionality new clause relate to online marketplace be hold liable for product purchase via their platform we agree that there be scope for improvement to be make in this area which be why have ask the law commission to conduct full and comprehensive review of product liability legislation and make suggestion for reform follow its report which we anticipate will be release next year we will legislate if necessary to ensure that our product liability law be up to date and fit for the future turn briefly to new clause the bill power cover various product category include lithium ion battery although concern about battery safety be valid the bill must remain broad to address evolve product effectively to improve lithium ion battery safety we have publish research from the warwick manufacturing group that highlight risk such as compatibility and design issue those finding will guide intervention include regulatory standard and improve guidance we be committed to collaborate with stakeholder to determine what action should be take forward amendment to would render unenforceable many requirement introduce in regulation under the bill remove power to create enforcement function would make requirement introduce in new regulation ineffective particularly for new supply chain actor without power to effectively enforce new requirement good business will be undermine by those who ignore their duty and responsibility assure the house that the use of those power already have precedent in comparable matter the building safety act be recent example of primary legislation that create similar power new clause and amendment relate to product recall procedure supply chain actor be already under duty to report incident to enforcement authority and the public can already access an online database of recall the product safety alert report and recall database furthermore there be legislative route for consumer to pursue their right include right to repair replace or refund through various legislation such as the consumer protection act and the consumer protection from unfair trading regulations the government be review product recall as well as the full range of exist enforcement power for product safety and metrology so that the power can be target and effective the consultation follow royal assent will seek view on the structure of such power turn to new clause local authority do vital work across several area of consumer protection this bill be not the appropriate vehicle for broad review of enforcement capability for consumer protection legislation as it be limit to product and metrology regulation however it will help local authority by simplify product safety legislation and allow the government to consolidate enforcement power it will also provide for cost recovery power to be obtain by local authority something raise by my hon friend the member for harlow new clause to relate to product labelling we will not be accept they but thank my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central for table new clause and for shin light as he always do on an important uk sector that be very important to his part of the world manufacturer can already indicate the country of origin on the labelling of their good as long as the information be accurate falsely claim that product be make in the uk be an offence under exist uk consumer law which prohibit trader from mislead consumer understand that my hon friend have private member bill on the country of origin for ceramic which be introduce on april and be list for second reading next week will be interested to hear that debate and be always willing to engage with he on this important issue for his constituent new clause to relate to matter where separate legislation already apply new clause on the price of good fall under the price marking order which include requirement for unit pricing to be clearly label there be development in this area the competition and markets authority publish report in july on the use of unit pricing in store and online in the grocery sector follow this it make recommendation to reform unit pricing legislation and propose reform to the price marking order amendment to the order will come into force next april and will introduce additional requirement for retailer such as consistency in unit pricing that mean that all unit price for product sell by weight or volume must in future be display in either kilogram or litre there will be strict criterion on pricing legibility and the change will also provide clarity on how item in multibuy or loyalty card offer should be display we believe that these change will allow retailer to provide the information that customer need to make informed purchasing choice finally new clause and relate to country of origin information this be already require for certain pre pack food include beef origin label for food product however be well beyond the intend focus of the bill it be the case that current rule do not prevent british product from be label as british and this be often do voluntarily indeed the hon member for richmond park make reference to the make in britain campaign that be already in place we do not believe it be necessary to legislate to set up voluntary system when voluntary system be already in place in the light of that ask that the new clause be withdraw and all other amendment be not move beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause clause by leave withdraw new clause labelling for uk produce or manufacture product the secretary of state must establish voluntary labelling system to indicate when product have be produce or manufacture in the united kingdom the label must be display clearly on the front face packaging of applicable good standardise in appearance include nationally recognise symbol or wording indicate uk origin and legible visible and no small in font size than the unit price display or equivalent information on the product product qualify for the label if it be wholly or substantially produce manufacture grow or rear in the united kingdom and it meet any additional criterion as set out by regulation make by the secretary of state the secretary of state must consult food producer retailer consumer group and relevant trade association before set the criterion for qualifying product and the design of the label the secretary of state must undertake promotional campaign to ensure consumer be aware of the new labelling system regulation under this section must be make within month of the passing of this act in this section product include food drink and manufactured good available for retail sale produce or manufacture in the united kingdom include good where the final significant production process occur in the olney this new clause would require the government to introduce voluntary labelling system clearly mark good produce or manufacture in the uk help consumer make informed choice and support domestic producer bring up and read the first time question put that the clause be read second time

steve yemm daniel zeichner vicky foxcroft anna turley the house divide ayes noes question accordingly negative third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time this bill will help to preserve the united kingdom position as global leader in product regulation support business protect consumer and ensure fair and level playing field across our economy whether on the high street or on online marketplace it be design to future proof our approach to product regulation and metrology ensure that we can respond effectively to emerge technology tackle modern day safety challenge and create the condition for safe innovation and sustainable economic growth by strengthen the system that underpin confidence in our good market we be reinforce one of the core pillar of productive and competitive economy as hon member will know the majority of the uk product safety and metrology law have their root in eu legislation develop over the past year that framework serve we well in many respect but of course we have leave the european union so we have responsibility and an opportunity to tailor our rule to the uk own need circumstance and ambition we have hear argument today as we do in committee that this measure bill be some mysterious route back into the eu do the minister agree that far from discover trojan horse the opposition be try to flog dead one and that their argument have be make up on the hoof give my hon friend out of for ingenuity have hear so many reference to horse during the passage of the bill that at time feel be at the aintree racecourse we can be clear that the bill will not lead to dynamic alignment by default we have hear lot of myth about the bill the other myth that have be parrot be that the bill will see the end of the great british pint do the minister agree that actually it secure the great british pint look forward to enjoy one with he in the next few month indeed the bill do secure the great british pint thank to an amendment in the other place it will hopefully be enshrine in law look forward to join my hon friend in enjoy one at some point in the not too distant future the pace of change in both consumer behaviour and product innovation be only accelerate from connected device and artificial intelligence to new material and manufacturing method the nature of risk and regulation be constantly shift we must ensure that our regulator be equip with the right tool to act quickly and proportionately so that we can both manage and harness the hazard and the economic potential of new technology the bill provide the power to do just that it give parliament the ability to update and strengthen product regulation and legal metrology in coherent consistent way do the minister agree that the bill be instrumental in keep the uk at the forefront of science internationally thank my hon friend for his intervention he have certainly get the measure of this bill hon member oh will not give up the day job and we will not have division on that either this be framework that support business by reduce unnecessary burden support consumer by keep dangerous good off the market and support the uk economy by make our regulatory system more agile more responsive and more transparent in short the bill will help to ensure that every product on the uk market whether make in the united kingdom or import from abroad meet the expectation of safety fairness and quality that the public rightly demand the minister rightly point out that the bill will allow for new regulation to come on board to keep we safe but the safety element of that come about through the enforcement of those new rule can he say little about the conversation happen across government to ensure that our enforcement agency be properly resource to enforce the new regulation that be so vital my hon friend make an important point the ministry of housing communities and local government will be primarily responsible for enforcement at the local level but the bill also increase the power of local trading standard to enforce measure the bill affect the whole of the uk we have work closely and constructively with devolved government on policy development through regular engagement and throughout the bill passage at both ministerial and official level therefore thank the devolved government ministers and their team for work so constructively with we in committee we table an amendment that place statutory requirement on the secretary of state to obtain the consent of the devolve government where regulation contain provision within their devolved competence we believe that provide for the most effective and appropriate role for the devolved government in way that respect the individual devolution settlement be pleased to report that the senedd pass legislative consent motion for the bill yesterday have also have constructive discussion with the scottish government and the northern ireland executive and both have recommend legislative consent to their respective legislature we will continue to work collaboratively with those body to develop product regulation that good support business and consumer across the whole of the uk will provide quick recap of some of the change make to the bill by the government since it be introduce last year in addition to the devolution amendment because there have be some misconception about what the bill do and do not do we have add statutory consultation mechanism to ensure that stakeholder can shape product and metrology regulation we have extend the affirmative procedure to part of the bill to far boost parliamentary scrutiny for the avoidance of doubt they be detail in clause the affirmative procedure therefore now apply to the creation of criminal offence the first use of regulation cover online marketplace the first time duty be impose on new supply chain actor regulation confer power of entry search or inspection regulation to disapply requirement in response to an emergency regulation cover the sharing of information between person regulation on cost recovery which have already refer to in my response to the intervention from my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central regulation amend or repeal the gun barrel proof act regulation on consequential amendment to primary legislation and regulation amend the definition of online marketplace as member will be aware from the response on report there be number of reason that we want flexibility with regard to online marketplace which we believe will develop in way that we can not predict can confirm that aviation safety product be exempt from the bill as they be cover in exist legislation the government have publish code of conduct that set out the statutory and non statutory guardrail to ensure that regulation make under this legislation be proportionate and well design it be also worth address the criticism that this be skeletal bill and point out that the proportion of skeletal bills triple in compare with indeed in the former period some separate bills be describe as skeletal by the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee do the minister agree that far from be skeletal bill this legislation provide an adaptable framework for product regulation and consumer safety my hon friend be right indeed this go well beyond the measure in place when we be in the eu when it come to parliamentary involvement will briefly refer to contribution make by hon member during the passage of the bill thank my counterpart in the other place lord leong for shepherd the bill through the lords with support from lord hunt of king heath also thank the hon member for west worcestershire who have be alongside we throughout the passage of this bill in the public bill committee the hon member for wokingham clive jones for chippenham and for richmond park who represent the liberal democrats in committee and in the chamber be trio that we will never forget hope that the short passage of this bill be not reflection of the high turnover in liberal democrat spokespeople they have engage with the bill in constructive manner thank hon member who engage in the bill committee and the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes and my right hon friend the member for walsall and bloxwich valerie vaz who chair that committee with great expertise it be probably worth mention my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central again he have champion the ceramics industry both today and on second reading and we recognise his great contribution finally pay special tribute to my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson who as the first elect metrologist to this house have bring deeply technical and knowledgeable perspective to our debate which we all appreciate although do not think we could ever be ask to take quiz on the fine detail of his work on that point could the minister elaborate on how the bill support the advancement of british science suspect that my hon friend would be far well at do that himself his speech on second reading be fantastic example of how we explain legislation matter and practice it be important that we have certainty and consistency in how we measure thing and that we have clear legislative framework for the measurement that underpin all science he give we historical sweep of those issue when he speak on second reading it be important for to pass on my gratitude to all those official who have support we in the passage of the bill as well as the parliamentary staff who have enable it to come through swiftly and smoothly it will return to the other place for consideration of the amendment we have make in this place and be confident that in the spirit of constructive scrutiny and co operation that have characterise its progress so far it will continue on its way this legislation be an important step in strengthen our domestic regulatory regime and ensure that it be robust future face and fit for purpose in post brexit economy look forward to work with colleague in the other place to ensure that the bill finally reach the statute book as swiftly as possible call the shadow secretary of state let place on record my thank to my hon friend the member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin my right hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr holden and my hon friend the members for bognor regis and littlehampton alison griffiths and for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth for their work in hold the government to account on this bill on second reading say that the bill be the archetype of everything that be sometimes wrong with westminster but now after month of debate in both houses fear that it be even bad in the now prime minister say that his party would respect the outcome of the referendum in which million people vote to leave the european union britain have now fall victim to labour eu surrender summit give up our fishing right and our ability to make our own law be happy to concede that this be no long trojan horse of surrender bill because it be now in plain sight it be absurd that any government would give up the power to shape our own regulation and meet the need of our own consumer elector and business those economy that will succeed in the future be those that be agile that can adjust dynamically to event and that can tailor their own rulebook to their own particular need while this government track record be frankly disastrous still give they the benefit of the doubt when they say they wish for growth but for the benefit of labour members who rather suspect have not read the detail of this bill they have be whip into support it let spell out what it do the dynamic alignment clause in the bill would mean that every time the eu tweak its standard shape by the interest of other state with their own different mix of business often in competition with our britain would have to follow suit there would be no more bespoke trade deal around the world as the prime minister and his team would be lame duck negotiator with the eu president hold the real string the government boast of three trade deal in three week but that be hollow boast when not single one be back up by any detail the trade secretary who be noticeably absent today be no doubt try to make true what his prime minister have already announce the paymaster general confirm to in write answer this afternoon that british business exporter traveller and tourist will not benefit from gate as we be promise yet the government in all their naivety be legislate to hand control of our product regulation back to brussels at every stage of scrutiny this bill have be find want the mild mannered delegated powers and regulatory reform committee in the other place deliver an uncharacteristically scathing rebuke brand it skeleton bill that grotesquely shift legislative power from parliament to ministers it shackle british business already bleed out to eu standard stifle innovation it be solution in search of problem and under the bill under the measure be bring forward by the government today there be no room for the sort of robust scrutiny that we be send here by our constituent to do and no accountability it be all in the hand of ministers who keep break their promise let we be clear labour pattern of broken promise do not just set britain back it erode the trust that people have in politic this house have duty to restore faith in our democracy to protect our hard fought sovereignty and to say no to the overreach of blank cheque ministerial power such as those in the bill this house must tonight reject the bill as we will seek to do to stop the government from forsake britain ability to carve and determine its own future question put the house proceed to division will the serjeant at arm investigate the delay in the aye lobby diane abbott jack abbott debbie

to have secure this adjournment debate on an issue that might not be right at the top of the political agenda but affect the life of hundred of people in my constituency every day street parking on residential estate in bracknell it be topic that come up on the doorstep perhaps more than any other particularly in part of bracknell where we have old estate it be real challenge for people it affect not only their ability to get around our fantastic community but in some case their safety one of the core challenge we face be the mismatch between old estate design and modern car ownership bracknell be an old new town it celebrate its birthday last year and while it be design with an excellent active travel network which be build into its dna it be also design around the car it be an easy place to get around by car we be lucky that we do not see massive issue with traffic jam and the like but people still rely on their car as be the case in many town across the country the challenge be that many estate across bracknell particularly in wildridings great hollands and easthampstead be build when household typically have one small vehicle if that now many household have more than one car and the car be large to boot also because of the nature of the housing market we increasingly see more generation live in the same family home which only far compound the issue the garage build alongside the estate that be talk about in bracknell forest be build for different kind of car they be narrow and many no long fit car of the size that people drive today the obvious conclusion to all this be exactly what we see vehicle spill out on to road verge and pavement where household do not have driveway it cause huge challenge around space my hon friend be make an excellent speech and think he be about to describe the incredible pressure that many resident feel because of parking problem whether that be difficulty parking near their home difficulty walk along pavement because of pavement parking or one of many other problem it drive people absolutely crazy there be real pressure on community up and down the country in my experience do he agree that to help ease some of this the government should have new look at exist regulation at further refining resident parking scheme and at the more tricky issue such as case where one person or group of people park again and again on an unrestricted road in my constituency have have issue when people commute to work have park on the same road time and again which can be frustrating for resident as my hon friend say the basic problem be that there be many more vehicle nowadays and it be difficult to accommodate parking need but we must try thank my hon friend for that insightful intervention in bracknell forest we have few permit parking zone because they simply would not work for our community the point that he make be absolutely correct and will come back time and again in this debate to the need for local area to come up with local solution to these local problem ultimately community like his in reading and mine in bracknell forest know well what the solution be to some of these endemic issue thank my hon friend for the speech he be make this issue plague resident in my area too two particular problem be parking around school pick up and drop off wonder whether he have find the same and in unadopted estate real difficulty with enforcement when there be dangerous parking do this issue need to be address by local authority as well as the government absolutely my hon friend point about the challenge around school be well make we all want to see more young people and family walk and cycle to school but in some community that just be not possible also we have to be realistic in some community it just do not happen the end result be what we often see in street such as staplehurst in great hollands where there be lot of conflict between those go to pick up their kid from school and the family who live there who just need to get out without have their movement dictate by the timing of the school day it be real challenge in those situation local solution need to be the vehicle that take we forward if the house will pardon the pun enforcement be really important part of the puzzle on some street in bracknell forest at any hour of any day traffic warden could litter all the car with ticket frankly if there be not the parking infrastructure to allow car to park enforcement can only go so far so although it be absolutely part of the solution it be not the only part thank my constituency neighbour for give way and congratulate he on secure this adjournment debate as he know binfield in my constituency be part of bracknell forest an issue in binfield be commercial business be run from residential property which often create increase demand for parking really support the hon gentleman call for localise support and action to target this issue would he like to work together with bracknell forest and to come up with solution that sound like an excellent campaign have to say that have not necessarily identify that issue in my part of bracknell forest but perhaps the hon gentleman and could have further discussion in the tea room on that very important issue speak to the hon gentleman before the debate and congratulate he on bring forward this issue in my constituency of strangford which be very similar to his there be estate where the house be build in the and the road be narrow and be never build for household with two or more car and the situation be aggravate when young people learn to drive the department back home come up with the idea of enable those who have driveway to have white line put across they so that car can not park in front that be okay in theory but it do not work because car have to go in and out and there be problem when car park beyond the line as the hon gentleman know that lead to frustration anger and fisticuff and to neighbour fall out if there be to be an initiative from this house we look to the minister for that it have to start with legislation or direction from this place then council can have responsibility for take it to the next stage again well do to the hon gentleman for bring forward this issue there be not one of we in this house who do not agree with he may say what an honour it be to be intervene on by the hon member will take his suggestion and flip it on its head feel that local solution be the good way to tackle what be often local issue and part of the reason for that be exactly what we have hear today from member across the house in every community and on almost every street different issue cause the parking woe to which the hon member so powerfully refer parking be perhaps the great example of an issue that must be tackle from the bottom up and this place can empower local leader to come forward with common sense answer and strategy to address these very real issue in our community in bracknell forest there be estate where large number of home without driveway be once council house they be now in private ownership but the estate themselves have be transfer to the social housing association abri that make the issue even tricky to address bracknell forest council be work hard to tackle this issue in exactly the proactive and practical way to which have refer and it have be undertake scheme to convert grass verge into additional parking space almost road by road the council be identify underused grass verge and convert they into usable and safe parking bay and that be be do in partnership with abri it be an excellent example of what can be achieve when council and housing association work collaboratively to address share challenge that have not always be easy and it have involve complex legal issue around transfer ownership from social housing provider to the council but thank both the council and abri for work proactively together to address the concern also make it clear that this be not silver bullet such scheme be make real difference in part of bracknell forest but be fully aware that this be not enough and challenge remain it would be fantastic to see government take more action to support local authority to work with social housing provider in deliver such small scale locally target infrastructure improvement it be not about massive investment or complex solution but an obvious common sense one unlock exist local potential by simplify the process of course recognise that convert grass verge may be anathema to some let be clear support access to green space and do not want to see every corner of bracknell forest tarmacke over again my hon friend be make an excellent point may remind he that there be great deal of underused brownfield land that can sometimes be make available for parking in my constituency work previously as councillor on scheme to tarmac an unadopted road which my hon friend the member for norwich north alice macdonald mention and unadopted road and other area of hardstanding that be not formally use for parking can be convert without any loss of green space that be fantastic point and it again reinforce the local need for find solution as in bracknell forest where car be already park on grass verge because of the lack of parking space tear up the grass and in some case cause safety concern such as block blind corner it be also common sense to convert some of the verge in safe way into proper parking space rather than take away valuable green space it ensure that we well protect the grass verge that we do need another grow pressure on our estate which be very much on the government radar be the need to transition to electric vehicle as thing stand ev charging on housing estate with roadside only parking be almost impossible for many resident without driveway or off street bay there be nowhere to install home charger charge cable trail across pavement be serious safety concern for pedestrian wheelchair user and family alike bracknell forest council have be lead the way in instal charge infrastructure in council car park and there be good coverage for those who need to charge however there be challenge it can not be right that household with driveway who be more likely to be affluent already can access cheap and easy ev charging at home without pay vat while household without driveway struggle to access charge at home and have to pay above the odd at rapid charging station it be not just bracknell issue it be national challenge it be critical barrier to equitable access to evs particularly for those live in old estate thank my hon friend for raise these very important issue and his constituent will be delighted that he be do so on their behalf in ealing electric vehicle charging point have be major concern for the council to ensure they meet the need there be currently electric vehicle charge point throughout the borough but we need by the council have be consult on an electric vehicle roll out strategy to take strategic approach to the issue do he agree that other area would benefit from take similar strategic approach to the roll out of electric vehicle charging point absolutely that again go to the point about local solution be important thank the government for their work on reform set out by the national energy system operator to improve the speed at which ev charge infrastructure can be add to the grid will press on because be conscious that we be fast approach the witching hour another technical but very real issue that make it hard for local authority up and down the country to introduce parking restriction be that even simple localise restriction can cost up to in advertising fee because of the requirement under the road traffic regulation act to publicise they in local newspaper that be money not go towards tarmac or signage but simply to advertising cost as result resident can wait for month for minor change that could immediately improve safety and accessibility finally shall touch on pavement parking which know be divisive subject many member have argue that it should be illegal to park on pavement and understand why they hold such view recognise how difficult it be for people with pushchair as well as disabled people especially blind people to navigate pavement when car be park have also meet and hear from fantastic charity sustrans on this issue but the reality be that if we enforce total ban on pavement parking in bracknell forest there will simply be nowhere leave to park on many narrow estate pavement parking be the only way the road can remain passable that be why support give local authority the power to decide where to ban pavement parking base on local need and knowledge again this be about local flexibility council know their community well and community know what be good for they let we trust they to make the right call and empower they to tackle this really significant issue face so many family in bracknell forest and across the country thank my hon friend the member for bracknell peter swallow for raise this important matter with the government and congratulate he on secure this debate have hear his concern regard the inadequate provision of parking across his constituency and recognise the issue he raise on the accessibility of parking these be important issue which have direct link to the welfare of local community and the economic prosperity of our town let cover some of the main point raise in his remark and other intervention as my hon friend will be all too aware competition for parking space especially for accessible street parking across this country be already substantial the government recognise the provision of accessible and reliable parking be particularly important outside of the major metropolitan area where public transportation be often limit and where people need to be able to drive to access basic service and economic centre although the government understand the benefit of private car use for individual up and down the country with many across our community rely on private vehicle as key part of their life also recognise that many estate be simply not equipped to deal with the number of car on our road that be most keenly feel by resident in old estate this problem have be exacerbate by the fact that modern car have grow not only in number but in size as my hon friend rightly reference in his remark as result the grow demand for the provision of parking risk become unmanageable that will not only be frustrating to resident who own vehicle but can also lead to irresponsible or even dangerous parking in prohibit area my department be aware of the complaint many resident of bracknell forest have raise about park vehicle prevent the flow of traffic and welcome the measure the council have now put in place to prevent this while the government recognise the importance of adequate provision of street parking for local community in line with the government position on localism parking be ultimately the responsibility of local authority and it be for they to determine what be appropriate in their area and local authority already have power to implement and enforce parking restriction the government understand that bracknell forest council have acknowledge the pressure with street parking in the community and be in the process of implement parking strategy with the objective of support the provision of parking in the borough note the concern my hon friend raise regard the council progress to date however it be right that local authority have autonomy over the nature and scope of parking policy within their local area as he rightly recognise when he speak about local solution local authority be well place to balance the need of resident emergency service local business and those who work in and visit their area of course the government be commit to invest in local community and improve local transport infrastructure the department for transport recently allocate to bracknell forest council from the local transport resource funding scheme under the scheme local transport authority can use this funding to build their capability and capacity to develop ambitious transport scheme develop and update local transport plan deliver local delivery plan fund individual project and retain the transport expertise to do this on pavement parking well understand that this can be real problem for pedestrian wheelchair user those with pram and buggy and especially people with mobility or visual impairment we be mindful of the concern many people have raise about inconsiderate pavement parking as my hon friend be likely already aware the department for transport hold consultation back in on the complex problem of pavement parking this government intend to publish formal response to that consultation later this year which will summarise the view receive and announce the government next step for pavement parking policy in the meantime highway authority may introduce specific local pavement parking restriction use their exist tro make power traffic regulation order and these can be enforce by council use their civil parking enforcement power my hon friend also raise the topic of electric vehicle charge on housing estate with roadside parking the government be commit to make ev charge infrastructure more affordable and accessible particularly for those without off street parking most electric vehicle driver charge overnight at home which be often the most convenient and cost effective option to support those without on street parking the government offer grant for home to purchase charge point when pair with cross pavement charging solution the department be aware of at least trial and hundred of individual installation of cross pavement solution across the uk the government be also work with local authority to encourage this technology in december the government publish cross pavement guidance to help local authority understand what they need to consider for the roll out of cross pavement solution that include relevant planning permission minimum exist standard responsibility and case study of trial for private land such as the residential estate my hon friend mention the landowner or private car park operator be responsible for parking provision and enforcement be pleased to hear that bracknell forest council be work with local landowner include housing association to deliver more parking capacity across the community housing association be private body and must make their own decision on how they run their business but the neighbourhood and community standard be clear that provider must co operate with partner to promote social environmental and economic wellbeing the standard include specific expectation that housing association co operate with local authority to support they in achieve their objective however the regulator of social housing do not dictate how individual housing association demonstrate how they comply with this duty welcome the co operation my hon friend mention be glad to hear his local authority be work collaboratively with abri the housing association in question and be pleased by bracknell forest council commitment through its parking strategy to work with housing association generally to help alleviate the pressure on parking to conclude thank my hon friend once again for raise this matter with the government we recognise the significant concern many community particularly those reside in old estate face regard the accessibility and availability of parking this essential resource be under increase pressure and we fully support local council in their endeavour to mitigate the challenge as say local council be well position to lead the initiative as they possess the intimate knowledge of their area and can effectively consider factor such as traffic flow capacity road safety and the diverse need of resident visitor and business but hope have give my hon friend sense of what the government be do to support they question put and agree to house adjourn
