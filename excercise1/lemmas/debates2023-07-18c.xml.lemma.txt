host major event in london focus on prevent child from starve to death and on prevent malnutrition and food insecurity it be all good and well that the uk be host event but the reality be that the amount of money it have to invest in food security be decline because of cut to the aid budget and now because of the home office use of official development assistance to house refugee if the home office really want people not to come here on small boat perhaps it would be well to spend that money on famine relief and food security so that people do not flee their country in the first place the

have be well how do my right hon friend the minister intend to achieve the consensual approach that be clearly his aspiration for international development and do he agree have hear many example this morning that nutrition and combat hunger must be at the heart of any strategy be extremely grateful to my right hon friend for his comment as he know we will hold summit specifically on stop child starve to death in november hope that the white paper will be announce at that summit but of course he be right this be cross party white paper design to ensure that we reach the sustainable development goal which be way off target at this midway point and do something to combat the appalling danger that the world face and which we have see so graphically in recent day on climate change for more than year the house have be highlight the threat of atrocity crime return to sudan as the minister have hear again today cross party last week we see more mass graf and widespread and systematic identity base targeting of community how much evidence do the government need before they acknowledge those crime against humanity and act on their own policy to take effective action to prevent and respond to atrocity the hon lady be entirely right in the language that she use about the atrocity take place in sudan and darfur that point have be extensively ventilate at this question time all can say to she to add to what have say already be that we be work very closely with our ally particularly the americans on precisely the subject that she have identify murder rape and pillage continue on massive scale across sudan as well as ensure that humanitarian aid get to those on the border and the financial sanction that we introduce last week will the ministerial team look far at way to cut off the source of funding for this violence in particular by sanction al khaleej bank and omdurman national bank which be associate with the two war general my right hon friend who know lot about the subject can rest assure that we be look at all possible sanction and other measure that we can take she refer to humanitarian access she will know that humanitarian worker have be murder during the course of the violence but we will do everything that we can to ensure that what she want to see happen happen the department travel advice be highly respect with observance consider mandatory by many business what advice will the minister give to british organisation that need to send an employee to uganda advice that protect the right of that employee and their privacy while also protect employee in this country from exposure in uganda to its cruel homosexuality act which criminalise intimacy and freedom of expression the hon lady be absolutely right the british government and the whole house be appal by the law that have be pass by uganda we make very strong representation our high commission there work closely with affected group and we always keep travel advice under sharp and close review child be able to play be something we take for grant yet minister will know from their travel that it be not something that all child around the world get to do play instil confidence build life skill enhance resilience and restore hope so will minister commit to the house that they will take lead role in the forthcoming un general assembly to support the resolution for an international day of play which be spearhead by coalition of organisation such as lego and ikea to ensure that every child right to play be protect the idea of an international day of play be very important and we take it seriously will pick the matter up with the noble lord ahmad and keep in touch with my hon friend in the past decade more than billion people have be affect by climate disaster through displacement drought and food insecurity the climate crisis be both create and aggravating humanitarian emergency where be the ambitious strategy for uk aid to build resilience and offset the implication of climate breakdown the hon lady be right to identify climate change as the great existential crisis of this era two week ago we have the hot temperature see in the world ever on the monday it be then exceed on wednesday and exceed again on thursday one way we have change how humanitarian work be do be by build in more adaptation and resilience when we deploy humanitarian support and we will go on do that evidence suggest that malaria be on the move it have appear in part of the us and be creep across europe can the foreign office please confirm that it be serious about eradicate malaria and neglect tropical disease across the world and say what plan be be take if any to keep british people safe my hon friend be entirely right be recently in mozambique where they have manage to cut malaria infection by but we see that climate change be now lead to its increase again we will do everything we can to make sure that what have previously be successful policy of malaria eradication get back on track as soon as possible loophole in the sanction regime have see russian steel process in turkey and export to the uk the increase in russian steel export to turkey in the last year alone show the extent of the problem the government have belatedly introduce ban on import of such steel but without enforcement the ban will be meaningless can the minister tell the house what the government plan be to enforce the ban on import of russian steel process in turkey as have say we continue to work on our sanction policy to ensure that we get to grip with any potential circumvention but it would not be appropriate for to announce any future plan yet whether it be the accession to the trans pacific partnership the first free trade agreement with malaysia and brunei our foreign secretary at the association of southeast asian nations summit or the joint economic trade committee with indonesia on thursday the government be rightly do all they can to bring alive the benefit of our trans pacific and indo pacific pivot do my right hon friend agree that we in this house should all do everything we can to bring alive the potential for business in our nation whether in design frigate cyber edtech or anything else mr graham do not push it too far be not be funny it be totally unfair some member be not go to get in now my hon friend be right the opportunity the indo pacific bring for uk citizen and business be enormous and we look forward to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership be one more new opportunity for they to discover one of the most exciting part of the world follow up the question from my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah billingham constituent be regularly in touch with her ugandan girlfriend live in fear of her life every day as new law have see more and more people persecute what more can the government do with our ally to help people such as my constituent girlfriend and protect activist and human right defender in uganda we be make representation as often as we can there be limit to what we can do but we be seek to stretch those limit as far as possible speak to the ugandan foreign minister on may to underline our opposition to the anti homosexuality act and highlight its impact on the safety of people in uganda both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have speak to the ugandan foreign minister and the ugandan high commissioner in london the environment food and rural affairs committee be finalise our report on food security which have come into sharp focus because of the pandemic and the war in ukraine with russia regrettably pull out of the black sea grain deal will my right hon friend reassure the house that the uk government be work closely with the un and nato ally such as turkey to restore that deal which be so important for food security across europe and in develop country my hon friend be absolutely right of course we should make it clear that what russia be do be lead directly to people starve in africa everyone should understand that as well as the atrocious action that russia have take in invade neighbouring country the minister be aware of the arrest of yasin malik kashmiri political prisoner whose only crime be oppose the indian military occupation of kashmir what talk have be have with the indian government about his death penalty as say in response to an early question the uk oppose the death penalty in every country in the world include india post office horizon it scandal compensation urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make statement on the interim report of the post office horizon it scandal inquiry relate to compensation thank the right hon member for his question and his tireless campaign on this issue be also grateful to sir wyn williams for his work and for publish his interim report we will of course consider that properly in the come day and provide formal response to the house sir wyn report recap the progress make in deliver compensation he note our repeat commitment which reiterate again that that compensation should be full and fair he note allegation from some lawyer that there be impediment to provide such compensation but say that he can not see any legal reason why we can not deliver our commitment he be right and that commitment will be deliver sir wyn first four recommendation deal with the advisory board of which the right hon gentleman be member as he know the board be establish at the instigation of my department and its composition and remit be extend as result of discussion between ministers official himself and the rest of the board it have already perform very valuable service notably its last meeting make recommendation about an appeal process independent of the post office we be consider that recommendation and will reply in due course sir wyn also refer to the tax treatment of compensation payment the right hon member will acknowledge that when we work with he and the board on that matter it result in million of additional payment in the historic shortfall scheme and exemption from income tax capital gain tax and national insurance contribution sir wyn also suggest that we should legislate to extend the deadline for the group litigation order compensation scheme as we have state we will not let an arbitrary date stand in the way of pay full and fair compensation to postmaster as compensation be be deliver under the sole authority of the appropriation act spend on it be limit to two year window that close in august next year the government be determined to deliver compensation by that date that remain perfectly possible but challenging if it seem likely that we will not be able to compensate everyone in time we shall of course consider legislation as sir wyn recommend want to deliver by that date not for some legalistic reason but in the interest of postmaster who have wait too long for justice may start by declare an interest as member of the horizon compensation advisory board thank the minister for his remark and for the positive and constructive approach with which he have address this issue also thank sir wyn and the inquiry for their ongoing work agree with many of sir wyn recommendation would be interested to know exactly when they will be respond to especially because lot of they be in the note that the advisory board send to the minister at the last meeting the three compensation scheme have become unwieldy but the fundamental point be that equal and fair compensation have to be pay to all the people across the three scheme would be interested to know from the minister when the recommendation will be address particularly on extend the remit of the advisory board accept what he say our aim and certainly his be to get compensation to people as quickly as possible the elephant in the room that need to be address be the continued obstructive role of the post office find it remarkable that yesterday on bbc radio the chief executive nick read say that the sheer scale of the problem have go above and beyond anything that anybody could realistically expect that beg the question of what he have be do for the last four year and why he have be accept bonus for his and his management role in the inquiry the inquiry be stall last week because again the post office fail to disclose document to it when be this issue go to be deal with it either get deal with or nick read and the entire board have to be sack the minister know because he have meet many of the people who be wait for compensation that they have go through lot they need justice and they need action ill conceive comment from the present chief executive of the post office be rub salt in the wound of the victim either he have to go or something have to radically change at the post office be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his work he be right to say that there be three scheme which might be describe as suboptimal as sir wyn have say on this occasion and previous occasion we be where we find ourselves and we must push on that be the easy way and the good way to get compensation for those affect refer in my initial remark to the request that the right hon gentleman have make for an appeal mechanism we be consider that carefully think he would acknowledge that whenever he have come to with something that he think we should consider we have always do that and be keen to deliver the mechanism that the board require the delay in disclosure be unacceptable without question and the post office have apologise for that you be only as good as your last game and the post office have to up its game there be no doubt about it we have governance review into early issue around remuneration and the metric regard bonus which be find to be completely inappropriate we be wait for that report which should receive by the end of this month we will take that under advisement as we do any other evidence we receive about the operation of the board of the post office thank my hon friend for the update some individual have suffer incredible destitution and injustice for far too long this have go on for more than year and some people have die during this process will he ensure that the post office own up to what it have do and that the individual who be responsible for cover this up year ago be bring to justice rather than this leave stain on the reputation of the postmaster and postmistress who be totally innocent of any crime be grateful to my hon friend for his work on this issue he be right people have pass away while await compensation it be simply unacceptable my department be look at creative way of accelerate the process of provide compensation to the victim agree with my hon friend about the need for people to be hold to account and speak about that on number of occasion from the back benches it be right that people be hold to account it be also right that due process be follow sir wyn williams inquiry be there to identify what go wrong and why and who be responsible and once that be do we should make judgment about what happen to those people but be keen like my hon friend that people be hold to account call the shadow minister nine hundred prosecution all the postmaster involve have their own story of dream crush career ruin family destroy reputation smash and life lose innocent people have be bankrupt and imprison this may well be the large miscarriage of justice in our country history and pay tribute to member on all side of this house who have work for justice none more so than my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones also thank the advisory board and sir wyn for their work as well as the minister for the constructive approach he have take on this issue to date however as sir wyn interim report make clear the compensation scheme for postmaster be mess the commitment to give fair compensation should apply to all postmaster sir wyn specifically recommend that term of reference should enable the monitoring of individual case can the minister say that he will act on that recommendation and when can we expect he to respond in full to the report recommendation include maximise the use of the horizon compensation advisory board and provide clarity about the tax status of compensation payment can he also provide final figure for claim that have be make to the historical shortfall scheme and how much the government anticipate the final compensation will cost also ask the minister what he be go to do about post office management as the only shareholder in the post office do his department take responsibility for address those management issue the leadership team accept bonus for their work on the inquiry which be just unacceptable when will the minister deal with this sub postmaster have have their life ruin they must be confident that lesson will be learn from those failure sadly it seem that the post office have fail to do so add my thank to the advisory board and the right hon member for north durham but also to lord arbuthnot who be tremendous campaigner in this area and other individual such as professor moorhead who we be keen to include on the advisory board also thank campaigner on both side of this house who make sure that the issue come to light and that action be take to address these horrendous situation on individual case as say to the right hon member for north durham we be look at sir wyn recommendation there be an appeal mechanism and condition of the term of reference do not prevent we from look to make sure that claim have be settle fairly and fully that be something we be look at and we will respond in due course on the tax position as say early we have provide an extra million to address that we be keen to make sure that not only all the settlement but all the tax treatment of those settlement be fair across the board on the total for the historical shortfall scheme we have make offer total over million in value and million have be accept so we have make good progress but we be keen to make further progress on the remain claim that be yet to be accept on the post office management there have be number of unacceptable matter relate to what have happen in the governance of the post office that be why we put in place governance review which be be conduct by very competent legal firm it be due to report by the end of this month we will study that review carefully and respond accordingly the minister in place at the moment will realise that former colleague have stand at the dispatch box and give excuse the procrastination from his department have be terrible and the effect be ongoing fulsome and full compensation be to be welcome but the word that be miss from the minister statement be timely therefore the first part of my question be this why two year why not two month or two week pay the compensation to the postmaster affect the second part of my question be about the senior management team so far they have get away with it they need to be hold to account as do their it consultant when will something positively be do to bring those people to book again know my hon friend be one of the key campaigner on this particular issue can not speak for previous ministers although have great regard for my immediate predecessor certainly who have deal with this issue have not see any procrastination and we be drive this as quickly as possible within the department on why not two week rather than two year settle compensation claim be complicated it be about specific instance of pecuniary loss and non pecuniary loss it be complicated we be keen to get that money out the door as quickly as possible and as have say we be look at creative way to do that be just as ambitious as my hon friend be to get that money into the hand of the people who need it there have be interim payment of around million on both outstanding scheme the glo and overturned conviction scheme nevertheless full and fair compensation be what we desire on people be hold to account refer my hon friend to what say early we need to see the result of the inquiry that be what sir wyn williams be there for and we need to see the outcome of his inquiry and where he can identify blame we be very keen to make sure those people be hold to account call the snp spokesperson do not know where to start there be so much but here go the snp welcome sir wyn williams interim report on compensation his recommendation would go huge way to ensure that victim be fully and fairly compensate and it be about time the enhanced role for the horizon compensation advisory board be welcome as well but the question as one hon member have already say be when be this all go to happen know the minister can not give we an answer to that today but he update something have in my note it be now claimant who have die without receive full and fair compensation we need to move this on funnily enough we have meeting of the all party parliamentary group on post office this morning at which the chief executive officer of post office ltd appear and answer some question the culture at post office ltd have not change since the new ceo take on his role in he promise to change the culture he have not yet do so we be mire in obfuscation still and we can not get to the truth of stuff because of the delay in provide evidence to sir wyn inquiry will the minister agree to put pressure on the ceo to get this do the hon lady be one of the members of parliament engage with more often than not in this place and she do fantastic job not least in chair the all party parliamentary group on post office so thank she for her work agree with everything she say about the pace of delivery the quality of delivery from the post office and make sure it meet its obligation we have this constantly under review and we be drive this issue we be determined to look at creative way to accelerate compensation for all those affect by this so we can finally draw line under the matter accept we will not draw line under it until we have hold people to account for what have go wrong so that be something we be extremely keen to do where there have be such grave miscarriage of justice it strike that we should be pull out all the stop to ensure that justice be do and in timely fashion so perhaps the government might consider bring criminal charge against the post office and its it adviser as way of accelerate the process on pull out all the stop could not agree more and that be definitely what we be do in the department my day be never without one or other post office issue which be not the situation we want on bring forward criminal charge of course the government do not do that but when our enforcement agency determine that there have be criminal action wherever those criminal action have emanate from we would of course expect they to take action call the chair of the business and trade committee the victim of the post office horizon scandal should be fully compensate so that they be put back into the position they would have be in have they not be victim of this miscarriage of justice in the first place the minister have agree with that statement from the dispatch box before but it be not happen can say that it be not complicated process to be able to quantify their loss and to be able to compensate they fully my committee understand the advisory board and the statutory inquiry have suggest that one way to try to improve this be to remove the post office entirely from this process and to make it an independent process properly budget with the requirement to fully compensate the victim in the way have describe why will the government not just do that thank the hon member for his work in challenge we in this area would probably push back bit it be complicated to assess loss both and the right hon member for north durham sit in on long call with the hss panel recently and some eminent lawyer give we lot of confidence that this be be do right on an inquisitorial basis but it be complicated to assess those loss would refer to sir wyn williams comment he basically say that we should carry on what we be do he would not necessarily have advise this route in the first place but what he say now be that the good thing we can do be push on with the framework we have in place there be three different scheme we need to push they on more quickly of course and be very keen to do that as former post office counter clerk myself understand at first hand how the horizon it debacle have devastating impact on postmaster their family and their business will the minister assure the house that lesson have be learn from this terrible case certainly we have learn the lesson in this place to heed those warning more quickly be sure the new management of the post office have see what have go wrong and we be clearly keen to make sure it never happen again do not think we will be able to say we have learn the lesson and this will not happen again until we have receive the final result of the inquiry and then decide what action can be take against the individual responsible because that will be the ultimate deterrent in stop these thing happen again the significance of sir wyn bring forward an interim report of this sort be something that should not be underestimate be with the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows in the appg meeting this morning and it be clear that as far as the chief executive of the post office be concern in deal with historical matter such as this he see it as major barrier to change the culture within the post office whether that be reason or an excuse remain to be see but he have to ensure that that barrier be remove so that there can be no further excuse about change the culture agree and we be determined to play our part in that of course be very grateful for the report and have read the recommendation clearly there be lot of detail in the report that want to study and consider fully but think it be very helpful do not see anything in the recommendation immediately object to as say want to make good study of those thing but number of different process have to take place we have to give due process the time to do its work in make sure that we establish exactly what have go on so that we can put those matter right like many other have sub postmaster who have suffer in this space would just like to thank member across the house most notably the minister his predecessor my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully the hon member for bristol north west darren jones be on the select committee when we be particularly look at this issue and thank he for his time on that and obviously the right hon member for north durham mr jones for his energy there could just reiterate what so many have say and ask the minister to accelerate with all energy the payment to the victim and will he please follow through on the consequence for the post office leadership and its it consultant thank my hon friend for the point in his question and we absolutely agree that we need to accelerate compensation payment as say we have make significant progress on the hss scheme for the two other scheme the glo scheme and the overturn conviction scheme we need to get those payment resolve as quickly as possible there have be around million of interim payment through those scheme but the full and fair compensation the final compensation be where we need to get to on hold people to account he will have hear what say early and absolutely agree with he on that point the report state that there be something like late application to be determine and that there may yet be significantly more late application as well can the minister confirm that those application will be seriously consider and that those victim may be entitle to compensation can he provide an assessment as to whether the number have quote be accurate or be actually high the hon gentleman raise an interesting point as do sir wyn williams and we be look at that recommendation carefully it be our intention that everybody who have be affect by this be fully and fairly compensate and we will look at any further issue that might get in the way of that we be keen to resolve those kind of issue have be involve in the investigation into the post office horizon scandal since my arrival in this house back in represent my constituent mr and mrs rudkin by follow the investigation by ron warmington of forensic accountant second sight and his evidence know that they have be wrongly convict the right hon member for north durham mr jones know and have evidence that they have be wrongly convict the post office have evidence that they have be wrongly convict importantly the government have evidence that they have be wrongly convict will the minister explain why more than nine year after we all know they be innocent they be still wait for full fair compensation and closure on this issue they be the real victim in all this the sub postmaster we certainly agree with that and we should leave it to the williams inquiry to establish who know what when and what could have be do early and hold those people to account get wide compensation out to those affect be the no priority and the why who and when be secondary point to ensure that people be fairly compensate that be the no thing on my agenda and thank the hon gentleman for all his work on this issue over number of year will the minister explain why fujitsu whose it software be at the heart of this scandal continue to win government contract include recent extension to post office contract worth million those decision be make by other not by so can not comment on those specific case the hon lady raise an interesting point to be fair in this country people be still innocent until prove guilty and it be right that due process be follow and guilt establish before we make decision on how we treat company or individual down the line like she would like to see the full result of the williams inquiry as soon as possible so that we can determine blame decent honest people postmaster have have their life ruin and be put in prison and they be now be make to wait year for justice and compensation the public inquiry also expose racism and discrimination at the post office fujitsu run it help desk during the horizon scandal will the minister outline what the government be do with regard to the appropriateness of fujitsu win public contract in future deal with that question second or two ago it be right that the presumption of innocence be follow until prove otherwise and the williams inquiry be look at fujitsu role in this as well as the role of individual in the post office and elsewhere with regard to the document he refer to clearly that be inappropriate and the post office have apologise for it that document among other form part of the horizon inquiry which will need to establish the full fact before we decide what action to take commend the right hon member for north durham mr jones and other who have assiduously pursue this matter and doggedly ensure government response know of postmaster who have lose their shirt because of the dreadful scandal while it might be acceptable to push the date back on paper in reality that could mean more default on payment and loan and further humiliation for those people who have be tar as dishonest when we all know they to be decent and honourable can something be do to ensure that those who need it the most now have access to their reparation as that will help they on the road to recovery from the trauma that they be feel at this moment in time be grateful to the hon gentleman for speak out about this matter on number of occasion one of my constituent sam harrison of nawton near helmsley pass away prior to receive full and fair compensation and that situation should never have be allow to happen interim payment be available so some compensation be available in the terrible situation where somebody have pass away that compensation will still be pay to their estate that be slim comfort of course and the hon gentleman central point that we should get the money out the door as quickly as possible be one totally agree with some individual who have already be compensate have be devastate to find that significant portion of that money have go straight to pay back creditor they be then in the position of have to make second compensation claim suffer additional stress and anxiety what talk have there be about ensure that any payment make be sufficient to cover all expense as well as properly compensate individual for their hardship and loss without the need for additional claim be grateful to the hon lady for her question and be happy to look at any specific case if she be talk about those who be bankruptcy claimant sir wyn in his report agree with our view that insolvency practitioner should not be able to take share of group litigation order compensation we have take advice from specialist counsel on how good to deal with that issue and we will look to take further action on that in due course comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make statement on the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership the secretary of state for business and trade sign the accession protocol to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership on sunday july in auckland the uk will be the first new member since cptpp be create with the uk as member cptpp will have combined gdp of trillion and will account for of global gdp accession to the agreement send powerful signal that the uk be use our post brexit freedom to boost our economy it will secure our place as the second large economy in trade grouping dedicate to free and rule base trade it give we seat at the table in set standard for the global economy the agreement be gateway to the wide indo pacific which be set to account for the majority of global growth and around half of the world middle class consumer in the decade to come that will bring new opportunity for british business abroad and will support job at home more than of current uk good export to cptpp country will be eligible for zero tariff the uk world lead service firm will benefit from modern rule ensure non discriminatory treatment and great transparency that will make it easy for they to provide service to consumer in other cptpp country in an historic first join cptpp will mean that the uk and malaysia be in free trade agreement together for the first time that will give business well access to market worth billion manufacturer of key uk export will be able to make the most of tariff reduction to that thriving market tariff of around on whisky will be eliminate within year and tariff of on car will be eliminate within seven year join cptpp mark key step in the development of the uk independent trade policy our status as an independent trading nation be put the uk in an enviable position membership of that agreement will be welcome addition to our bilateral free trade agreement with more than country pay tribute to the many official and minister who have work on this deal over the past two year some of whom be in the chamber today thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question the government publish write statement yesterday that the cptpp have be sign on july unfortunately member have not have an opportunity to scrutinise the agreement or to ask the secretary of state question about its impact the cptpp contain controversial provision that will potentially undermine british health and safety standard as well as those in place for the environment and animal welfare organisation from trade union to the rspca have express their concern it be apparent that clause in the arrangement will allow large company to sue the uk government behind close door if they believe that their profit have suffer from change to law or regulation palm oil produce in malaysia will have tariff of eliminate include from area that have be deforest there be apparently no mechanism to ensure that import of palm oil have be sustainably produce on food standard the agreement exclude egg as sensitive sector mean that egg product will be allow to be import from country that be cptpp member but where egg production rely heavily on battery cage hen which be outlaw in britain in for other animal product sow stall the use of antibiotic hormone treatment and pesticide that be outlaw here will all potentially be import in great number import that have low production cost but much high animal welfare and environmental one risk undermine our world lead british farmer and food producer the business and trade committee which provide important scrutiny of the process for free trade agreement produce report last week that lament its inability to scrutinise all element of the trade agreement have the follow question for the minister what step be his government take to ensure that the british public can be sure that the food they buy have be produce to the food safety and animal welfare standard that they rightly expect such as those of the british lion code of practice what estimate have he make of the long term impact on british farming of this agreement which will bring an increase to gdp of only over decade be disappointed that the hon lady do not see the opportunity for farmer and for this country as whole from cptpp if she share the confidence in british producer and british service that we have on the government benches she might be able to look at this deal with glass half full rather than glass half empty but know that would be fundamental change of attitude the hon lady be simply wrong in many area it be important that we stop peddle these myth about standard relate to cptpp or any trade deal we be do let we be clear that this deal do not lower any uk product or quality safety requirement the import standard and import rule that we have the day before we join cptpp will be exactly the same the day after the deal do not alter safety standard but give we an opportunity to engage and talk with colleague and friend around the world on how we would like to improve and work on important issue such as the environment which she mention and there be indeed an environment chapter for example the uk be commit to tackle illegal deforestation within uk supply chain and this deal will not change that as part of conclude cptpp the uk and malaysia have issue joint statement to reaffirm and strengthen joint work to support sustainable production particularly of palm oil in our supply chain despite what the naysayer on the opposition benches might say be it not true that this deal benefit county and nation across these isle and give our farmer the opportunity to export to part of the world that will pay premium for their great product my right hon friend be absolutely right as always and thank he for his work in make this deal reality too he be absolutely correct that this deal create opportunity across the whole range of food and beverage include scotch whisky which have already mention this deal should be welcome by scotland for the opportunity it give but in many area of food we be open up market such as in dairy produce he be absolutely right to point out that we estimate that cptpp will bring benefit to every single nation and region of the uk would hope today that we hear about those positive stride on cptpp from all those in the chamber who represent different part of the country call the shadow secretary of state congratulate the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan on secure this urgent question we on the opposition benches be pro trade pro business and pro worker and we welcome the opening up of new market for uk exporter have meet representative from the cptpp signatory and make clear to they our commitment to drive up trade however we now must scrutinise the full detail of this agreement because with this government the devil be always in the detail what provision be in place to ensure the high possible worker right and that uk worker be operate on level playing field the minister mention the sustainability agreement with malaysia can he tell we exactly how that will deal with the concern raise on palm oil can he also tell we whether the government have put in place any side letter as the government of new zealand have do to exclude the operation of the investor state dispute resolution mechanism can he confirm that the agreement will not undermine the windsor framework on china application to join cptpp what approach will the government take to safeguard british interest we have raise the issue of the scrutiny process on free trade agreement many time can he set out what the scrutiny process will be the government own modelling suggest that this accession will add to gdp at the same time the obr predict that export will fall by this year hit of more than billion promise trade deal with the us and india be not even in sight be it not the reality today that we have government out of idea and bad at negotiate and it be the economy that suffer be sorry to hear the opposition yet again never miss an opportunity to talk britain down this be great opportunity for business right across the uk already cptpp country sustain about one in job in the uk and that will only go in one direction it will increase because of the opportunity include in investment that open up the shadow secretary of state mention investor state dispute settlement there be coverage of isds it be good thing and it help ensure confidence in international trading and international investment he mention china he will be well aware that we be not yet fully ratify member of cptpp so it would be inappropriate for we to comment on any individual application however what can say be that we know after two year of negotiation what an incredibly high bar exist on membership of this fantastic organisation do my hon friend agree that this be not only an important trade deal but an important geopolitical event that allow britain share value which the labour prime minister of new zealand and the labour prime minister of australia say they share to be bring to the partnership and to strengthen the partnership as it go forward my right hon friend be make powerful and important point about the importance of pivot to the indo pacific where there be so much global growth we want to be part of that growth thank he for the incredible work he do as one of the prime minister trade envoy as well as more trade this deal will lead to further co operation when we trade with country we talk to they more we have agreement and discussion on whole range of issue some of which go beyond the strict term of trade agreement there be many opportunity to come out of this deal and be pleased that many member on the government benches recognise they call the shadow snp spokesperson it feel unnecessary to repeat this but this government seem willing to sign up to any trade deal my party be in favour of good one and we be against poor one and that be why we oppose this deal interruption the concern that we have despite the heckling from those on the government benches about the lack of mechanism to safeguard worker right and about the potential impact on domestic standard particularly in the agrifood sector do not go away with blustery repetition and flat contradiction which seem to be the stock in trade in all that government front benchers have to say about this deal the secretary of state get aerate whenever it be point out that the government own figure show that gdp be estimate to increase by only over the next year as result of the deal at the same time as the office for budget responsibility forecast hit to gdp through brexit minister have have an awful long time to find out what the figure actually be if they do not believe that figure without reference to vague opportunity the number of middle class consumer in the pacific rim or the gdp of country in the cptpp and without deviation repetition or hesitation what exactly will the impact be on uk gdp as result of this deal again be disappointed to see the hon gentleman talk negatively about deal that will benefit scotland as well as all other part of the united kingdom it will add significant amount we estimate that in the long run at least billion year will be add to the uk economy include in his constituency perhaps he would like to welcome that rather than be negative about it also this be grow area of the world there be likely to be new member so we anticipate considerable opportunity go forward in scotland business be already own by cptpp country employ more than people in scotland perhaps he would like to welcome that as someone who have serve as the prime minister trade envoy for the past seven year in chile colombia peru and argentina warmly welcome this announcement urge the minister to make sure we be use the time between now and finally join cptpp to make sure that in the sector that we think will be hugely beneficial to we we be ramp up that british industry presence and be work with his majesty trade commissioner for the area to identify opportunity thank my hon friend for his work as trade envoy as well as all the trade envoy for the important work they do he make an important point sign the deal be one thing but we need to ensure that it be use the secretary of state have say that again and again we will be make sure that there be full benefit use export support service and all the training trade adviser and so on to promote the deal as we have with the australia and new zealand deal because it be important that we get the full benefit of the deal and maximise those benefit right across the country call the chair of the business and trade committee uk car manufacturer be currently change their supply chain to buy component from either the eu or the uk so that they can continue to export their car into the eu however under cptpp those same company ought to be buy part from vietnam to export their car to mexico that be quite confusing will the department publish guidance for business that highlight the regulatory conflict between trade with the european union under the trade and co operation agreement and trade with member of the cptptpp sorry you know what mean laughter it trip off the tongue eventually the hon gentleman be underestimate the opportunity but he have give the chance to point out one of the key benefit of cptpp which be cumulation with product and part be use of course supply chain can be complex across cptpp and still benefit from the low tariff so there be huge opportunity with cptpp for the reason that he outline congratulate the minister as well as all the ministers who have contribute to this significant moment with the uk strike trade deal with some of the world fast grow economy do he agree that this provide great opportunity for all part of the united kingdom where we have significant strength in term of drive export what action be he plan to take to promote the trade deal all around the uk so that manufacturer food producer and other supplier take the opportunity that he have provide thank my right hon friend again really appreciate the recognition that the deal will benefit all nation and all region of the uk in wales for example there be currently cptpp own business employ more than people and we expect that to go up there be trade opportunity in so many area cover both good and service that be really important point as we negotiate lot of trade deal around the world one thing we notice about many of the deal do by the eu on our behalf be that they do not cover service yet service be over of our economy so it be great that we be now negotiate deal that fit our modern economy even if the world be flat for the benefit of the minister back benchers it be not the pacific would still be very far away compare to europe so how do the deal benefit fresh seafood producer and shellfish producer on the west coast of scotland who can not get their fresh produce into the much close european market as result of brexit how on earth be they suppose to get that fresh produce even more quickly halfway around the world again be sorry to hear hon member conflate different point we have leave the european union that be democratic decision and we have good free trade agreement with the european union that will continue cptpp create opportunity in area of the world with considerable growth where we do not previously have deal surely the hon member must recognise that that be positive thing right across the country include for his constituent this be good news be delighted that the government have sign up to this huge trade partnership we be the first non found member to have do so while it may not be in the convenient party political interest of some opposition members it be very much in the national interest and dare say it in the interest of shropshire business small medium and large who will now be able to export tariff free or towards tariff free to place such as malaysia and vietnam what progress if any have the minister hear about the united states potentially join the partnership as well that of course would be huge boon to everybody my hon friend make an important point about the role that small and medium sized enterprise can play we be work to encourage even more sme to export through export support service and the trade adviser network give the opportunity that this and other deal will present to they he will be aware that the us be not enter into free trade agreement with anybody at the moment have speak to congressman and woman in the us and there be mixed view but many have great enthusiasm for the cptpp despite all the government fanfare the cptpp trade deal will contribute merely to our country gdp over the next decade laughably the secretary of state be now dispute her own department modelling as part of the spring budget the obr forecast say that in due to government incompetence the hard brexit and failure to sign other free trade deal uk export be set to fall by that be staggering billion hit to our economy how exactly will the minister compensate for that loss with respect to the signing of the new cptpp deal again be so disappointed to hear opposition member never miss an opportunity to talk britain down cptpp will benefit every nation and region of the uk to the tune of billion and billion of the hon member say that be tiny but if we put it in his bank account tomorrow he would probably be quite happy we be talk about huge amount of money and lot of job right across the united kingdom it would be great to see the opposition support one of these deal which will benefit their own constituent at some point join other in congratulate the secretary of state her predecessor and all the ministers involve in deliver this excellent deal which as have be say be really good news for the uk it be depressing to hear opposition members comment they clearly have little confidence in british company business in the yorkshire and humber region will certainly benefit from the new deal will the minister elaborate little more on how he see those business be able to take advantage of it thank my hon friend for his work in championing international trade over many year he be right that sign this deal and other deal be one thing but we must ensure that business be aware of the opportunity therefore we will be and be already work through export support service trade adviser and other programme to ensure that we take full advantage of the opportunity available we want business large and small some of whom have probably never export before to realise that there be whole world of opportunity out there in the eu but also way beyond that great emphasis have be place on the diplomatic benefit that the uk will see through join the cptpp what further step be minister take to cultivate positive diplomatic relation in the indo pacific region there be multiple way in which we be do so in fact the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend the member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan be do exactly that right around the indo pacific on an ongoing basis as well as advance our trading opportunity there be many opportunity to have discussion on wide range of issue that concern we and our constituent whether that be the environment labour right or whole bunch of other some of those be part of trade deal but many go beyond they we have discussion across multiple government departments on those issue thank the government for this excellent announcement and congratulate all of those who have make it possible it be beyond question that join the cptpp be absolutely the right thing to do may please ask the minister what message he have for the doomster who think that britain should not have global role who think that britain be in permanent decline and who think that we would be well off back in the european union the message be quite simple life be well with the conservatives in charge let we not be churlish this be good deal and the government deserve some credit for it sometimes despair when hear those negative comment when something be good let we say that it be good in the light of this tremendous deal secure by the business and trade secretary will the minister further outline how his department will work with fcdo ministers to ensure that such deal far the aim and term of our moral duty and international obligation again congratulate the minister and the government on their hard work well achieve and deal do thank the hon member for his always gracious and consider comment he be right that we be committed to ensure that all nation and region of the uk benefit from this deal include northern ireland which be do great thing with export opportunity in fact there be northern ireland investment summit come up and therefore many opportunity we will work constantly with the administrations to make sure we take full advantage of this and all deal congratulate my hon friend and everyone involve in secure this deal the impact of export service across the world be clearly vital will he outline the advantage for the service deal available particularly to london and the digital economy which can be reach from anywhere in the world my hon friend make sensible point that be pivotal to our future trading arrangement we be the second big service exporter in the world those service be increasingly be transport and therefore physical distance do not matter they can be deliver at the press of button we have an excellent reputation on those he make the point about london more than business be own by cptpp member and over job be reliant on those business that will only increase over time it be important to stress that london be benefit from our relationship with cptpp member but more than of the benefit be outside london in contrast to the negativity from the opposition benches that ooze across the chamber positively welcome my hon friend update be there anything comparable in recent history or down the track as good as the agreement and partnership that have be enter into let we bank this agreement for the positive benefit it will bring my hon friend know be yellowbelly and lincolnshire people always talk common sense as do he there be lot of opportunity but this be one of many deal we have already sign and ink more than since we leave the european union we be in negotiation with many area include india switzerland and other importantly we be focus on service as well as good because some of those deal do not cover service at the moment in the european economic community referendum campaign barbara castle ask what kind of internationalism be it that say that henceforth this country must give priority to frenchman over an indian german over an australian an italian over malaysian this be the language of internationalism it be euro jingoism do my hon friend agree that with the signing of the partnership the era of euro jingoism be dead and once more we be truly an international trading power my hon friend speak eloquently and be absolutely right europe will continue to be an important trading partner of the united kingdom but there be whole world out there that we have not yet take full advantage of the government be commit to work on behalf of our constituent to recognise the benefit from around the world through our relationship with commonwealth country and develop country that can significantly benefit from international deal the eu will continue to be important but there be whole new world out there and we want to be part of it defence command paper refresh with permission would like to make statement on the publication of our refresh defence command paper it be just over two year since we publish the original command paper in march in those two year our security have be challenge in so many way this be defence response to more contested and volatile world in the last four year that have be defence secretary have be consistent about the reform have seek to implement want defence to be threat lead understanding and act on the threat face our nation as our sole mission not protect force structure cap badge or much love equipment but ensure that we be focused on challenging threat want the ministry of defence to be campaigning department adopt more proactive posture and our force more forward and present in the world with return to campaign assertively and constantly push back those threat and our adversary want defence to be sustainable in every sense for too long defence be hollow out by both labour and conservative governments leave our force overstretch and underequipped we must match our ambition to our resource our equipment plan to our budget and take care of our people to sustain they in their duty we must never forget the travesty of the snatch land rovers in afghanistan the defence command paper be true to those principle and with some tough choice present an honest plan for what we can and will achieve credible force capable of protect the nation ready to meet the threat of today but invest heavily to modernise for those of the future force in which every major platform would be renew by from armoured vehicle to dreadnought submarine frigate to satellite we do not plan on issue new command paper just two year on many of the conclusion of that command paper remain right russia be and be the great threat to european security and china rapid military modernisation and grow assertiveness in the indo pacific and beyond do pose an increase challenge to we all however have always say that as the situation change we must change with it since the first dcp be release the world have shift once more from competitive age to contested and volatile world the technology advance we predict materialise the threat and challenge we fear have manifest there be no more immediate threat than russia its full scale invasion of ukraine be not simply an assault on proud and sovereign nation but an attack on all our value european security and the open international order on which stability and prosperity have depend for over three quarter of century right now the people of ukraine be suffer the tragic consequence of president putin illegal unprovoked invasion his naked aggression and imperial ambition have play out in tragedy of epic human suffering the brave citizen soldier of the armed force of ukraine be protect their own nation and people quite heroically take on the once mighty russian force the whole house recognise that they fight not just for their freedom but for our they be not just liberate their homeland but defend the rule base system as defence secretary it be important to import the lesson learn from the conflict to our own force while wish such lesson be generate in different way the conflict have become an incubator of new way of war they be prove the way for warfare in the whole of nation internationally partner innovative digitise operate with tempo precision and range requirement and recognition that there be trade off between assurance level and operational impact be proud too of the role the uk be play in support ukraine whether provide equipment training or political support or galvanise european and international ally and industrial partner to do likewise but the return of war to the continent of europe alongside grow threat elsewhere in the world have mean that we must sharpen our approach the integrated review refresh publish in march outline how we would do that it would shape the global strategic environment increase our focus on deterrence and defence address vulnerability that leave our nation expose and invest in the uk unique strength defence be central to all those effort that be why after three decade in which all party have continue draw the post cold war peace dividend this prime minister reverse that trend and provide defence with an additional billion over four year he and the chancellor have go far since in response to the war in ukraine next year we will spend over billion on defence for the first time in our history that be nearly billion year more cash investment than when become defence secretary in real term increase of more than this government have commit to increase spending yet far over the long term to of gdp as we improve the fiscal position and grow our economy our defence plan and the armed force to deliver they must be robust and credible not fantasy force design unfunded gimmick or top trump number as russia have so effectively prove there be no point have parade ground army and massed rank of man and machine if they can not be integrate as single full spectrum force sustain in the field under all the demand of modern warfighting that take professional force well equipped and rapidly adaptable support by critical enabler and vast stockpile of munition that be why in this document hon member will not find shiny new announcement comms lead policy drive unsustainable force design or any major new platform for military enthusiast to put up on their chart on their bedroom wall we stand by the command paper we publish in but we must get there fast do defence differently and get ourselves on to campaign foot to protect the nation and help it prosper as say stand here when be announce we owe it to the man and woman of our armed force to make policy reality the work be just begin in this refresh we have focus on how to drive the lesson of ukraine into our core business and on how to recover the warfighting resilience need to generate credible conventional deterrence the great advantage of have serve in defence for some time be that my ministerial team and have now take proper look under the bonnet consequently we be clear that our strategic advantage derive from four key source which require urgent prioritisation first and foremost be our first class people our man and woman be not just brave and committed but talented and incredibly skilled they be our real battle win capability it be our duty to ensure they be as well support prepared and equip as possible so we be go to invest in they last year commission richard haythornthwaite to conduct the first review of workforce incentivisation for almost year it be such good work that we be incorporate the response into our command paper and today be unveil new employment model and skill framework for our armed force it will offer our people spectrum of service that allow far great career flexibility make it easy for military personnel to zig zag between different role whether regular or reserve or between the civil service and industry we be transform our force overall employment offer by adopt total reward approach to provide much more compelling and competitive incentivisation package since all our armed force personnel deserve the good quality accommodation we be inject furth million to improve our service accommodation in the next two year many of we over christmas will have be frustrate by the poor support our service personnel and their family receive from those task with look after their accommodation it be for that reason that have withhold their profit and use the money to freeze for one year only the rent increase our personnel be due to pay take together alongside such initiative as wraparound childcare they be intend to enrich career and enhance the ability of our most talented people to keep protect the british people and to ensure they be reward and fulfil while they do so our second priority be far strengthen our scientific and technological base we be already world leader in specific area but to continue outmatch our adversary we must stay ahead of the curve in digital datum and emerge scientific field in we say we would invest billion in advanced research and development in fact we be now invest significantly more to stay ahead in the technology prove themselves vital on the battlefield of ukraine such as ai quantum and robotic we be enable culture of innovation across defence pull through those breakthrough to the frontline follow in ukraine footstep we be increasingly source the solution that can stop million threat in their track win both the kinetic and economic exchange of modern warfare of course our ability to do that depend on the quality of our relationship with the industry which be our third priority be push the ministry of defence to form close alliance with our industrial partner genuine partnership to sustain our defence will mean do thing differently ukraine remind we that time wait for no one it be no good hold out for the solution that be obsolete by the time it be launch often be good enough especially if it mean swiftly put kit into the hand of our service personnel capability can be rapidly upgrade spirally develop for the relentless cycle of battlefield adaptation to win the innovation battle instead of stick to acquisition programme that drag on for decade we be set maximum delivery period of five year for hardware and three year for digital programme our fourth priority be productivity and campaigning to face this increasingly contested and volatile world we need to make major change to the machinery of the department and its method we be emphasise an ethos focus ruthlessly on the delivery of real world effect increase the bang for buck in everything we do this approach reach into every part of the defence enterprise from the front line to the back office and involve major redesign of the department we must shift our whole organisational culture away from the previous peacetime mentality to one where we live and operate as we would fight focus more on output than input and achieve well balance between risk and reward that mean empower people to live and operate alongside partner and sometimes to be enable by they when in low threat environment that mean ensure our equipment whether type challenger or typhoons have the infrastructure and supply need to sustain operation more of the time and to deliver real world effect wherever and whenever it be need and it mean work with the relevant regulatory authority for example the military aviation authority to accelerate the experimentation testing and innovating of new technology while remain within legal bound want to emphasise one final aspect of the command paper refresh namely the development of global campaigning approach we start with review of our head office where we break out campaign delivery from policy formation and establish integrated campaign team they have adversary focus not geographic and will drive our endure campaign in the same way operational commander lead our force on deploy operation the indivisibility of operational theatre in today world mean defence must be constantly ready to respond globally to safeguard our interest and those of our ally sometimes it will be to evacuate our citizen in moment of crisis such as in sudan other time it will be to deter an adversary or reassure friend as we have show through our support for ukraine the uk government have the political will but that only matter if it be match by our military agility today we be establish defence global response force ready integrated and lethal it will well cohere exist force from across land sea air space and cyber to get there first in response to unpredictable event around the world crucially today paper also recognise that it be in the interconnected world and that the uk be unlikely to act alone partnership be critical to our security and prosperity in future we will be ally by design and national by exception our support for nato will remain iron clothe but we will continue to prioritise our core relationship we will invest in deepen relationship with our new partner it be why we have invest to expand our global defence network improve communication and co ordinating defence attachés within our intelligence function none of that be headline grab stuff but it be the fine detail that make the difference to our national security to conclude the paper be the result of have several year in the department to understand where it need most attention that continuity in office be improve and be incredibly grateful to the long serve minister for armed forces my right hon friend the member for wells james heappey whose experience in uniform and public office provide the basis for this paper we be grateful to the hundred of individual and group who contribute to the first challenge phase of its drafting from academic to serve personnel and industry representative not to mention the many member of this house most of what we learn from they be encapsulate in the document this be likely to be one of my last appearance at the dispatch box it have be the great privilege to serve as secretary of state for defence for the last four year thank my team civil servant special adviser and members for their support and their challenge all of we here have the common interest of defend this fine country its value and its freedom of all the many function of government defence be the most important and be more important than ever as the next year will be more unstable and insecure the man and woman of our armed force be second to none and britain place in the world be anchor in their professionalism and sacrifice believe we will increasingly call on they in the year ahead we must ensure that they be ready to answer that call wish they and whomever replace well commend the statement to the house thank the defence secretary for the advance draft copy of his statement and welcome some element he announce today that be not in that draft copy such as the improved childcare package and the rent freeze for armed force personnel follow the defence secretary decision to stand down want to start by pay tribute to his time in this house he be political survivor remember that his first job in be as parliamentary private secretary to ken clarke and for the last four year he have be dedicated defence secretary in particular want to recognise his work on ukraine and that of the minister for armed forces the right hon member for wells james heappey his decision on send military support to ukraine get other nation to do more and declassify intelligence have all be beneficial for ukraine and for britain today the defence secretary be present his plan for the future of the british armed force at time when as he tell the house this afternoon we have the return of war to the continent of europe alongside grow threat elsewhere in the world as his own future be now short how long be the shelf life of his plan industry and military leader can not be sure that his successor will agree with his decision will accept his cut will act on his approach and they can not be sure how the strategic defence review plan of both his party and mine after the next election will reboot defence planning it do not have to be this way labour want this to be the nation defence plan not the plan of current conservative defence ministers we offer to work with the government on plan to make britain secure at home and strong abroad this be not such plan it be not good enough response to war in europe it be not enough to accelerate support for ukraine to fulfil in full our nato obligation to halt the hollowing out of our force and to renew the nation moral contract with those who serve and the family who support they why have this defence plan be so delay it be day since putin shatter european security since then other nato nation have reboot defence plan and budget in the time it have take the defence secretary to produce this long trail new defence strategy finland have carry out its own review overturn decade of non alignment increase defence spending by apply to join nato and see its application approve by parliaments before last week nato summit in vilnius that successful nato summit have make the alliance strong and support for ukraine great we fully back nato new regional plan and the long term security commitment to ukraine and if uk military aid be accelerate in the come day that too will have labour full support there be welcome back to basic element in this plan focus on stockpile training service condition and more combat readiness but it be clear that the plan be drive by cost not by threat it be drive by the real cut in day to day resource departmental expenditure limit spend that the defence secretary agree in november and by the failure to secure the billion extra that he say be need in the spring budget just to cover inflation where be the halt in further cut in the army while nato plan an eightfold increase in its high readiness force where be the commitment to fulfil in full our nato obligation where be the action plan for military support to ukraine first promise by the defence secretary in august last year where be the programme to reverse record low level of satisfaction with service life where be the full scale reform of broken defence procurement system for which the defence committee call on the very day the defence secretary announce that he be step down in fact it be hard to tell from his announcement today what have change the billion for defence research and development be promise in the integrated review the global response force and force level cut be announce in the secretary of state defence command paper and the strategic reserve be recommend by lord lancaster in as the right hon gentleman step down as the conservatives long serve defence secretary will he accept that many of the big challenge be be leave to the next defence secretary and to the next government finally as we may not see he again at the dispatch box may on behalf of members in all part of the house wish he well in his post parliamentary career thank the right hon gentleman for his kind comment unfortunately for he will however be here again tomorrow deliver my very last statement understand what the right hon gentleman be say but this be the refresh of the defence command paper it be not complete redrawing of strategic defence and security review we have do those periodically so many time and so many time they have be publish under government of both party and so many time they have not have real funding attach to they so many time we have reach the end of the sdsr period under labour and conservative governments with black hole with unspent money and overspend it have happen time and again but this be report to make we match fit to ensure that whether we have of gdp we have the reform that in my view and hope that of my successor will help we to deal with the grow threat that we face in the decade ahead and will also reflect the lesson that we have see in ukraine the right hon gentleman mention finland defence review he will know that finland and sweden periodically conduct fix in parliament in schedule review that be how it will always be those country ask parliamentary committee to carry out the review and then hand it to their defence ministries to implement that be their process finland review be not trigger by anything specific and the fact that it produce that review before do this refresh be not benchmark it have be predict and profile will say however that long before sweden and finland join nato be the architect of last january security pact between the uk and those country that be because recognise that they be our friend and our ally and while they be not in nato it be inconceivable that we as britain would never come to their aid should more aggressive putin attack they that be the beginning of the process of develop our strong relationship with they the right hon gentleman talk about defence procurement have read the report produce by my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois and thank he for it many of the thing in it we be now do give credit to he obviously for his report but some of its observation have also be mine observation about sro about and about spiral development cost observation that the house have hear from this dispatch box about gold plating and the over speccing that have too often drive price through the roof and be cumbersome thing interruption let say this to the opposition members who be heckle and who have be ministers in this department they will know that of all the departments to serve in this be not one that move at the great speed of reform the process of reform take time and member need only look at the record of every single former minister to know how hard it be that do not undermine their contribution and it do not make any of they less of minister but this department of people department that seek every authority through ministerial chair be not and have serve in number of departments the quick to change no doubt the right hon gentleman if he succeed in his ambition to be the next defence secretary or the one after next will learn that all too well what promise he as will promise my successor be that will not come to this house and pretend that the problem with which my successor be deal be make the week before they be make year before that be the truth of many of the policy and procurement challenge with which we deal in this department believe that the command paper will stand the test of time because it be about face the threat and that be the answer to the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey for the record we be about to lose one of the good defence secretaries we have ever have he will be sorely miss in this house and in the department he know that we have discuss what be wrong with defence procurement on many occasion and he know that the public accounts committee and the defence committee have publish number of report say that it be break the most recent entitle it be broke and it time to fix it be publish only last sunday and on tuesday we see the dcp refresh whose acquisition strategy have effectively accept some of the recommendation in our report within hour humbly submit that that be some kind of world record for select committee report however the proof of the pudding be in the eating let in all seriousness encourage the defence secretary when he do his handover to whoever succeed he accompany by his excellent team of junior ministers to impress on his successor the fact that we really do need to bring about this reform not just for industry and not just for our armed force but for the whole security and defence of the realm and with that we wish he well thank my right hon friend for his work on the report and for his campaigning let also say however that procurement have start to improve in the average time delay on project be it be now the average cost overrun be on project in it be now the direction of travel be improve the number of civil servant at go from to so we be cut away the bureaucracy and the direction of travel be report september vol in my time as secretary of state for defence be also determined to put to bed some of the problem project that we be all inheriting be pleased to say that as speak ajax be back on track and start to be deliver to the unit the unit be start to train in it now we could all have discussion about whether we would have choose ajax all those year ago but fundamentally it have not cost the taxpayer any more money and it be be deliver to our frontline be determined to put that right or take other step to deal with it that should always be the case the other thing that have always try to do which be not in the document but which recommend in defence procurement be to never defer either delete or deliver if you defer it cost hundred of million of pound defer the aircraft carrier cost billion under the labour government defer the cost million deferral create the black hole delete or deliver but do defer call the scottish national party spokesperson too thank the secretary of state for advance sight of draft statement albeit that there be one or two addition on delivery also perhaps pre emptively join in wish he well in whatever come next although have not directly shadow he certainly pass on those thought from my hon friend the member for angus dave doogan who have work closely with he over period now will start on positive note welcome number of the point make very much welcome the fact that people be put front and centre that be absolutely critical in anything we do in defence people be what make it work and if we be not support the man and woman of the force what be we do at all there be probably that more we can do even beyond this while it will not surprise ministers to hear say that we need to support those serve we also need to continue to look at what we be do to support our veteran know that the minister be work on that but it be an area in which we need to try to do more also welcome the recognition of some of the accommodation condition welcome the fact that step be be take and matter look at but that need to be move forward at great pace note that the secretary of state say we be go to spend over billion for the first time next year wonder whether he can tell we how much of that be simply down to inflation create by this government be not try to be awkward but that be clearly quite significant factor we have also hear of the ongoing and long last issue around procurement with report show that roughly billion be waste each year in fail equipment programme and cancel procurement contract be the ministry of defence make the necessary reform to make its procedure well and will they deliver value for money recruitment and retention issue have be flag up the haythornthwaite review clearly highlight those be the right hon gentleman confident that the step be take now on the skill agenda will be the necessary action to address recruitment and retention issue finally the haythornthwaite review highlight cyber capability as major issue be the right hon gentleman confident that the step be take and outline today will do enough to deliver that capability in the way that we all want to see be grateful to the hon gentleman and grateful for his party support on ukraine on the haythornthwaite review and skill right across europe and the west we be see recruitment challenge in the military be with my new zealand counterpart recently and my canadian counterpart and they too have challenge the skill shortage across society be big and it be no different in the armed force which be why we have to adapt rapidly and tackle some of the challenge on procurement as say the figure have start to improve yes there be challenge and we could spend whole day debate the reason for those challenge complex procurement be not as straightforward as many people think and the hon gentleman will know from the scottish government procurement issue that it be not straightforward to deal with certainly believe that if we invest in the people and be prepared to invest in continuity if instead of have the senior responsible owner who help manage our project here today and go tomorrow we ensure that they be there for the long term and link their incentive to success and help they manage our project we will have well chance of deliver well value for money may express my admiration for my right hon friend dedicated and distinguished service as defence secretary it be sad commentary on the state of the special relationship that our american ally do not recognise his suitability to be the next secretary general of nato my right hon friend will remember that successive defence committees well before the invasion of ukraine argue that defence expenditure should never have be allow to fall below of gdp the present chancellor of the exchequer when he be stand for the leadership in even express the wish that it should be at of gdp which would have take we back to the cold war percentage of between and of gdp spend on defence in what way do this refresh allow defence the potential to expand quickly if that extra money be belatedly make available be very grateful to my right hon friend long before be do this job he be campaign for defence to be properly apportion the funding it deserve to keep this country safe and pay tribute to he for that he have fight for that for many year should there be an increase in funding for defence and seriously hope that there will be base on our prime minister pledge and if we invest in our specialty and our skill we can expand our armed force when the threat increase find way to hold those skill on the book even if they be rarely use be why it be important to develop single armed force act currently we have legislation that say that if you want to join the reserve from the regular you have to leave the regular and join separate legal entity the reserve that prevent soldier from go backwards and forwards and people from be mobilise in the way we want we want to introduce single armed force act we think this will help we do that skill be at the core the second thing be the investment in rapid procurement the ability to keep headroom in the budget to respond to the late threat as the adversary change the third be make sure that we invest in sustainability and enabler because there be no point in have all the frontline vehicle if you can not get anywhere know it be consider bad form to speak ill of the dead even the politically dead but frankly the secretary of state contribution be pretty thin and full of clichés and fundamentally an admission of failure of year of continual cut by this government let take just one example which be touch on in the report it be clear from allied exercise that in any major conflict we would run out of artillery munition within week and the ukraine invasion reinforce that so why have it take until this month for the secretary of state to sign the contract to replace those artillery shell it be very clear first the right hon gentleman might actually understand that sometimes the supply chain have to be reinvigorate when we place an order for the nlaw the next generation light anti tank weapon it turn out that the optic have stop be make year before you can ring up all you like and try to place an order the next day but until the manufacturer source the supply chain it be not go to happen but what do be ensure that place the order in the united kingdom in the north of england and in wales that factory will start produce mm shell have give it long term contract of half billion pound to start supply our force by the way the stockpile of our ammunition start deplete around about thank my right hon friend for his clarity his calmness his wisdom and his fortitude we will miss he it be clear that the tectonic plate of geopolitic have shift and make the world much more dangerous place for country such as the united kingdom and other that believe in freedom and democracy how will his new global response force help we and our ally be able to react more quickly and nimbly when crisis arise because we know that they will an important lesson from ukraine be to make sure it be digitally glue together and to make sure its command and control be not as vulnerable as it use to be it should have lot in the rear long way away perhaps thousand of mile away with only its headquarters forward we should make sure we invest in the enablers to move it around the world the continent or wherever it need to be that will help at the moment the provisional layout of the global response force be light brigade and air assault brigade support by logistical support brigade this will give we whole range of opportunity include meet our nato commitment should we wish to do something else with it we will be able to deliver as defence spokesperson and deputy leader of the dup thank the right hon gentleman for his honourable and gallant service to our armed force as the member of parliament for belfast east thank he for reinvigorate shipbuilding in our country and for support harland wolff thank he for his commitment to thales and nlaw and to the utility it have prove in ukraine as member of the defence committee thank the right hon gentleman for use our sub committee report on soft power and for the benefit see in his statement on engage defence attachés more thoroughly and appropriately with the intelligence network we can see that the document before we build on and augment the refresh in recognise the right hon gentleman four year well serve may ask he whether he believe this document will not only give our armed force the good chance to embrace the future but will ensure that his positive contribution leave last legacy this be about make sure the framework be match fit for any expansion and for the future it be also about invest in hole such as re stockpile and make sure that over time we spend billion and then another billion to make sure our stockpile be back where they should be in fact even more money to do that that will be good news for the like of thales and nlaw in belfast for the mm shell factory in washington and north wales and for our industrial base such as mbda in stevenage and bolton it will all be about invest in our sovereign supply chain while at the same time make sure we sometimes make difference not in the obvious thing but in the behind the scene that make our armed force so ready commend my right hon friend for his service and dedication as secretary of state and wish he well for the future as fellow infantryman he will know there be sometimes no substitute for boot on the ground if one want to command that ground give that the defence committee submit paper to the defence command paper refresh express concern about hollow out can he assure we that this hollow out will stop and that cut to the army in particular will stop what assurance can he give that not only will it stop but we will have scope to build on those number ultimately an army of and fall be simply not large enough give our commitment we can argue about size but we have to make sure that whatever we put in the field be properly equip and enable and be effectively that be really important we therefore have to be honest about the size of our defence budget envelope there be no point pretend that we can have huge number without defence budget to match have be determine throughout my tenure that this be not purely number game and know my hon friend get that many of his suggestion be incorporate into this command paper because the lesson of ukraine show that yes we need infantry and tank but also that we can sometimes dominate the ground without even be there the proliferation of cheap drone and the use of highly accurate artillery allow few people to cover or dominate more area go to see frontline corps commander in ukraine and he have nearly cheap unmanned aircraft system at his disposal every day at any one time he might have or up in the air which give he the ability to dominate ground without necessarily have mass get that ultimately the ground have to be take but let we make sure the people who take the ground be properly protect and equip so they can hold it otherwise russian force will take the ground and kill they may first thank the secretary of state for his service we have know each other for plus year and he have always be strong advocate for defence he say in his statement that in he get increase for the defence budget he fail to tell the house that one of the problem he face be the cut from to in the defence budget the command paper say that the first priority be homeland defence and our nato commitment it also announce new global response force how can we commit to do both well without substantially increase the defence budget be grateful for the right hon gentleman comment we both go to washington in to lobby for waiver from the international traffic in arms regulations and we be very close to get it that be my point if you think this department be quick and easy have hair back then if we get the itar waiver over the line it will be one of the thing will be proud of it be possible to have global response force and to dedicate it to nato we allocate our nato force by give they to the supreme allied commander europe but those force be able to be use elsewhere unless he call on they that be often how we do it so it be perfectly possible to have global response force with element of it elsewhere if it be not call upon by the supreme allied commander europe of course if nato call on the force under article or something else that will be the priority our force more often than not be absolutely dedicated to nato and the security of europe thank the secretary of state for his impressive no nonsense leadership it be always great to see minister who know his brief so well it have be year since the levene report give great power to single service but we be now move in the opposite direction with great integration full spectrum effect hybrid war joint effect call it what you will link up the military but also the military and other tool of state power do the secretary of state think levene be still fit for purpose what would he recommend that this house and his department do about it my hon friend make an important observation about levene do not think levene be fit for today part of levene have not work do not see the tlb or the army navy and air force take the responsibility we hop they would take when their programme do not work examine whether joint force design should move back to the centre where these thing will be at the core of the mod will be important on other part of levene it be important to make sure that the centre have role in hold our armed force to account the command paper have commitment to start review that process thank the secretary of state for his service where have agree with he have say so not least on his work to support ukraine but perhaps his big legacy be that he agree to and oversaw huge cut of in the army which believe seriously weaken our armed force want to test whether this document be more than warm word page say we will step up our effort to deliver an integrated air and missile defence approach when will that happen be just look up page which say that to counter these threat we will step up our effort to deliver an integrated air and missile defence approach we be do that across nato integrate with nato and work with the germans and the french we be already start that we have sign up to the process interruption we be start it now last month we start to examine what europe and nato need to have the right integrate air defence to protect its territory the starting point be to find out what we need there be no point in we rush out and buy long range air defence missile if the long range can be do from ship in the channel there be no point rush out and buy very short range if we be not deploy from our basis in tidworth so first we have already start do the overall survey of what need to be do secondly we have start invest in our next generation of gbad ground base air defence our medium range air defence capability and we have recognise that we be short of our long range air defence capability by we be already do it do not know where the hon gentleman have be for the past two year if he actually pay attention to this he would realise that we have start invest in the extend range missile for the type we have start increase the number of battery of our gbad and we have manage to export our gbad to poland in billion export deal so we have start this but the first thing to do be recognise that we put together the right profile of air defence because as he will know it be layered so we have to get the right layer if we do not get the right layer we look like some of those country such as russia which just buy big profile thing that can not talk to each other and then they get whack may begin by thank my right hon friend for his service and leadership do anything in this command paper address the barrier and bureaucracy that be hinder ukrainian defence manufacturer and british defence manufacturer from collaborate effectively together such collaboration would help the ukrainians to liberate their country and enhance our own capability and supply chain there be certainly an odd thing that observe in the department can not understand why the procurement speed and delivery in our kindred our operation to gift and support ukraine can not be normal for we see our procurement in parallel some of that be about assurance if we be go to fly drone over people in this country we require much high level of assurance the civil aviation authority and so on absolutely require that when you be in war some of those level can drop some of it be simply about that but in other area it be one lesson we be look at through defence equipment and support to understand how we can bring that into our main procurement and delivery the secretary of state know that be not defence expert although have great interest in it be bear in the same week as the bad bombing of london which take place not far from here close to the day on which this place be bomb and my father serve in the last war have watch the secretary of state over the year he have be in this house and have lot of regard for he we have become quite good friend which we be still allow to be across party in this house he be not perfect have be consistent critic of our go below man in our army have long track record on that but he be well secretary of state for defence than many have see on those benches do he realise that we be not daft on this issue how could prime minister and government allow man of his stature as defence secretary to go at the critical time when there be war in europe all hell be break out on our planet and we lose good defence secretary what have happen with the prime minister and the little clique around he thank the hon gentleman for his kind comment have always like both spar and discuss defence with he importantly many of we across the house understand that defence be core function of government it be not discretionary spend stick on the end it be ultimately the core responsibility of government know that come the next election the battleground between these two front bench team will probably not see defence in it we all know that many of we around this house who have campaign for more defence will know that the election will come down to school hospital transport and everything else the casualty of that be often defence and we stop make the case to our citizen and our constituent as to why it be important be grateful to the hon gentleman who always remind people on this side of the house and certainly under the previous leadership in his party of the importance of defence have fantastic team and there be plenty of amazing civil servant military leader and everyone else who will do just fine without in this job believe it be president lincoln who say the cemetery be full of indispensable man too pay tribute to my right hon friend be extremely disappointed that he be step down because he have be an excellent defence secretary as he say people be at the centre of our armed force so this refresh with its focus on people be welcome rick haythornthwaite report make some excellent recommendation so be pleased that the defence command paper reflect that can my right hon friend confirm that accommodation be an absolute priority because that be the big thing that every member of the armed force bring up when we go to visit it absolutely be the house have hear say that have take the profit from those company have nationalise more thing than any previous defence secretary so perhaps be put up job interview for the opposite this be absolutely about look after our people be determined to do so if these company could not provide the service why should our people take the hit there be an extra million to go into that some of we will have see the legal test we have try on annington homes to make sure that we re enfranchise this it be all very important if we can not give the people who work for we the skill future and lifestyle they deserve they will not be join we want to start by recognise the secretary of state leadership on ukraine and the wide threat from russia he make reference to the grow range of threat across the globe and how the uk often have to respond to those may invite he to go step far reflect on how the mod can work with other departments in whitehall and how the uk can work with its international partner on early intervention and prevention understand the driver of conflict for example gross human right abuse climate change and lack of international aid and see how we can get ahead of the curve in some situation the original defence command paper absolutely build on that on the resilience building of nation such as sadly mali if we can get in early enough and help those country with security complement aid and complement work on counter radicalisation education and poverty prevention we can help prevent those conflict one message give the treasury be that small amount of investment save we lot of money far along the conflict stability and security fund the foreign office and mod funding be really good piece of work where we often fund range of issue that deal with that be happy to write to the hon gentleman to give he detail of that fund thank the secretary of state for his regular visit to david brown santasalo gears in huddersfield in my constituency which be in the supply chain for the type frigate and for our submarine it also provide world lead gearbox for our armoured vehicle and tank do he agree that it be important to have resilient regional supply chain to deliver the equipment we need to tackle change global threat yes absolutely be delighted to visit david brown it be the famous david brown of the aston martin david brown in huddersfield when one go there one realise the importance of not only keep the skill base go but make sure that we have clear pipeline of order and pathway to incentivise those company to invest in the next generation of machinery if they do not feel incentivise they will not invest and when we need they at time of war there simply will not be anything there as say about some of the rearming of our stockpile restimulate the supply chain take year and it be incredibly important it be also important to recognise that the aerospace industry be pan united kingdom it go across the uk and be everywhere people do not often realise that it be not just in lancashire part of which represent it be in mill town in scotland and in wales it be all over the place the defence pound really do help the british economy and secure british job across the uk include in northern ireland the secretary of state be thoughtful man and today he have announce that we be go to be spend billion on defence at time when every other government department be under financial pressure he have also say that he predict that this country will be at war within seven year do he have any idea or process to bring about more peace and rapprochement in the world and less military threat or be we go to go on year by year increase expenditure on defence and potentially be involve in more and more military conflict do he have any idea different from that the right hon gentleman know fairly well we once spend nice week in iran together with the then member for blackburn be the most pro european of the three remember be not out look for war we be all out here try to defend our nation by avoid war but we do not avoid war by not invest in deterrence sometimes we have to invest in hard power to complement soft power we do not want to use it and we do not go look for it know the right hon gentleman mix with some people who always think this be about warmongere it be not but if country be not take seriously by their adversary that be one of the quick way to provoke war congratulate my right hon friend on an extraordinary four year as secretary of state for defence in which he have do his duty above and beyond he will be sorely miss welcome this refresh particularly the point he make about the global campaign and how it might complement aid with regard to our service personnel who do so much for we in the field of conflict how might we recognise they in term of campaigning when they be away for extended period of time what be the ministry of defence go to do to ensure that they be recognise for the extraordinary service that they provide our man and woman be motivate by lot of thing the state often show its appreciation not only when they be serve by the factor the wraparound but also by medallic recognition one of the thing that have take quite long time in my tenure be the creation of the wide campaign medal be still wait for the final approval by those medal committee but it will recognise people contribution to campaign that keep we safe good example of that could be the continuous at sea deterrent which be an endure campaign campaign that reflect modern war mean that not everyone be on the frontline people hundred of mile away be contribute to keep we safe and they sometimes need to be recognise not just the person pull the trigger or storm the bunker it go all the way back in today military the pyramid be very big and very deep and hopefully wide campaign medal will recognise that pay my own tribute to the secretary of state for his service and thank he for the personal courtesy that he and his official have show on number of occasion he have rightly be focus on the major geopolitical threat and risk to our own security and that of our ally but he will also know the importance of watch the flank and rear whether it be the western balkans the sahel which he mention space the polar region or the non geographical domain in cyber artificial intelligence and those issue he know that the range and diversity of threat be increase give that be he convince that we have the number of personnel right have no doubt about the commitment of our troop in all those area and capacity but the number be simply not there to deliver on that diversity and range of threat agree with the hon gentleman that as the threat rise we should respond and design our force to meet whatever be the threat of the day do think be enough to meet today threat do do think defence need great share of public spending yes and that be what the chancellor say in the autumn statement do think we need of gdp yes that be what have campaign for and what have achieve do not have timeline but know that be the direction should we get the extra money what be important about it be that it will prepare we to have range of choice depend on the threat of the moment the army will still be over people my hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr baron raise the challenge have instruct that the army modernisation require we to protect its budget until it be modernise it be behind the other two service and we will continue to modernise it think the army have currently configure size but do never say never about make it big we should always be prepare to change our course if the threat change thank my right hon friend the defence secretary for his statement and for his fantastic service over many year give the current tempo of commitment face by hm force worldwide be clear as former capability planner that quantity have quality of its own it be also incumbent upon the mod to fulfil all the expectation place upon it both by our nato ally and our own defence task will my right hon friend confirm that post refresh the mod remain committed to fully deployable scalable and sustainable armoured division at readiness yes we be committed to that but we have also be honest about the time need to get to be able to do that our force family be make to live in damp mouldy service accommodation with broken boiler in his statement the secretary of state speak about rent freeze but well over troop already do not pay rent because their accommodation be so bad he say that there would be no unfunded gimmick so be the million in two year for service accommodation new money or be it from exist budget and commitment have listen to the hon lady for example we have take money that be allocate elsewhere and decide that make sure those house be in well state be more of priority we have housing stock that go back many year and be challenge one of the challenge have be that unfortunately have to pay almost house to private finance initiative that gordon brown sign we up to even when those house be empty commend the leadership of the secretary of state over the last four year not just in our response to the war in ukraine but in secure record financial settlement from the treasury welcome the new employment model and skill framework will he outline how that will far facilitate collaboration with employer such as bae systems on the fylde coast and offer new opportunity for recruitment and retention the ministry of defence recognise as do the defence industry that skill be important about two week ago spend great afternoon at the national cyber force up at samlesbury with further education college from around lancashire include blackburn and bolton and greater manchester which come to bring young people amazing opportunity we recognise that if we invest young we will get the skill we need it be absolutely the case that without the skill defence will be starve of the oxygen we need to do our job too wish the secretary of state well and thank he for all that he have do while welcome the billion additional investment in stockpile and the improvement to readiness he will know that unless we have highly train service personnel in place to use they then they be useless the refresh document say people our most important asset in relation to people the uk now have the low number of soldier since the napoleonic war which think be quite dramatic will the secretary of state strategise to increase our strength in number to recruit young and capable people who want to defend this great nation the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland on the plane sit next to guy from belfast who be year old he have sign up to the army for year he want future can we give he that that young man will have an excellent future in the armed force for as long as he wish to stay the army be still recruit we have not all stop everything it be important to remember that we need to embrace our reserve we have talk about that for long time but we have not do it single armed force act would help we do that the army will be over people of whom will be regular but believe the reform in today refresh will make sure we be scalable should we wish to increase it whatever we do and whatever party in this house come with pledge in the next election we must ask ourselves whether it be just about fund people or will we be fund their equipment vehicle house and barrack to go along with they we can not just have people without any of that or we condemn they to pretty miserable time unprotected on the battlefield thank the secretary of state for his statement he have be an outstanding defence secretary and wish he all the good for the future be aware that under the new defence command paper soldier should soon be able easily to transfer between each of the three service as well as into the civil service what step be minister take to ensure that the civil service be more attractive option than the private sector for talented personnel the military could definitely take leaf out of the civil service book look at how senior civil servant can flex do step up and step down take break or sabbatical and think why can we do that for our military why can people if their life circumstance change not step up or step down that be what we be try to do with these change in the haythornthwaite regime if we do that we will match the demand of generation the young generation want more and more different thing it be not just whether they work in defence but whether they work in the civil service or in the private sector all employer face the challenge of how they will do that and keep people long so that they get investment both way into their business or whatever thank the secretary of state for his statement believe that he say he might be return here tomorrow as have number of ministers here wish to take the opportunity to say how important it be that no announcement be make in statement that have not previously be give to the opposition just in case be not in the chair tomorrow will take this opportunity to wish the secretary of state well in whatever he decide to do next afghan resettlement update in march update member of this house on afghan resettlement and relocation to date around individual have be bring to safety in the uk from afghanistan include some british national and their family as well as afghans who loyally serve the united kingdom and other identify as vulnerable and at risk be proud that our generous offer have ensure that all those relocate through safe and legal route have be able to access the vital health education and employment support that they need to integrate into our society include english language training for those who need it on top of that we have also ensure that all arrival have have the immediate right to work as well as access to the benefit system in my last update make it clear that this government do not consider it acceptable that at the time around afghans be still live in temporary bridging accommodation prevent they from put down root in community and build self sufficient life in this country around half of this number have be live in hotel for more than one year it be time to ask our afghan friend to find their own accommodation with the support of this government and to integrate into british society the status quo be not fair to taxpayer and crucially it be not fair to afghans since march we have issue legal notice to quit and individualised communication to household live in hotel and serviced apartment set out when their access to taxpayer fund bridging accommodation will end resident have receive at least three month notice to make arrangement to leave their hotel or serviced apartment and clear guidance on the support that they can access to help they find their own accommodation alongside that we have significantly step up our support for those in bridge accommodation and to local authority back by million of funding to speed up move into settle home we have ensure that enhance multi disciplinary case working team have be present in every bridge hotel and serviced apartment work closely with household to help they navigate the pathway to find their own private rent accommodation for local authority this funding include more than per afghan individual to enable they to support move ons we recognise that local authority will be well place to understand the specific need of individual family and the local housing market that be why we have ensure that this funding can be use flexibly and pragmatically in line with local circumstance over the past three month have meet local government leader and home builder and personally visit bridge hotel up and down the country have be hearten to see at first hand the many individual family and local authority who have hear this message and step up their effort to make use of central government generous offer and identify suitable non hotel accommodation some council be very effectively use this funding to offer significant support package include deposit furniture rental top up and rent advance among many other thing encourage local authority to share this good practice throughout their network as have say before this be national effort and we all need to play our part that be why be also urge landlord to make offer of accommodation by either speak to their local council or make an offer via the online afghanistan housing portal that we have set up this online form have be develop so that landlord and private individual can make offer of accommodation directly which be then share with potential tenant we be interested in property of all size and currently have particular need for one bedroom property and large property to help accommodate family across the uk since my last update we have see many hundred of individual leave their hotel and move into settle housing across the uk although progress have be make there be more to do have outline the generous support package that this government have put in place and example of the commitment and resourcefulness that have see from both afghans and local authority to rise to this challenge in return for this generous offer we expect family to help themselves as far as possible we want to empower afghans to secure their own accommodation and determine where they settle work with the caseworker available in every bridge property to do it within the limit of individual affordability see no reason why anybody live in hotel today should not be able to make use of their right to work and access to benefit and the flexible funding available to local authority to find suitable settle accommodation and live independently of central government support wish to make it clear today that the government remain committed to end access to costly hotel at the end of the notice period that we have issue to afghan individual and family for some this will be at the end of this month everyone will be expect to have leave bridge accommodation by the time their notice period expire there will however be small number for whom time limit contingency accommodation will be provide include where there be need to bridge short gap between the end of notice period and settle accommodation be ready for they to move into and in case of medical need where family member require continue attendance at specific hospital everyone else should be finalise their plan for move on from bridge accommodation repeat my call to our afghan friend and local authority they must access the support that the government have make available before the expiry of their notice period to leave bridge accommodation be write again to all local authority remind they of the funding stream available to help find settle housing solution for afghans who remain in bridge accommodation as well as the new stream of accommodation become available shortly implore they to draw on this support and match as many household into settle accommodation as possible central government be do their part and local government must do its this be the right thing to do both for the taxpayer and for those afghans who risk their life on our behalf and deserve the opportunity to live self sufficiently here in the uk call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement none the less have to say to he that this statement be not up to the quality that this house expect from minister on such an important issue the minister have be send here to update the house but in his statement he have give we no precise number of afghans who be currently in bridge accommodation no number of those he expect to stay in the time limit contingency offer and no estimate or detail madam deputy speaker this be really poor this house deserve well than statement that be light on delivery on such an important programme we need to understand the detail of what the minister be try to explain he be cabinet office minister come to update the house when defence ministers should be here explain why the afghan relocation and assistance policy be fail to deliver when home office ministers should be here explain why the afghan citizen resettlement scheme be fail to deliver and when levelling up housing and communities ministers should be here explain why we do not have sufficient home for those who be be move out of bridge accommodation in the middle of housing crisis the cabinet office minister in the chamber be the bailiff serve the eviction notice this be not good enough fear that he be human shield for the failure across government the statement today confirm what we already know the government be fail to support those people who serve alongside our force in afghanistan in few week time it will be two year since operation pitting begin but there be still backlog of arap application operation warm welcome have become operation cold shoulder with afghans be tell that they will be force out of temporary accommodation by the end of the summer can the minister tell we on what date the notice period expire what day will afghans no long be able to stay in bridge accommodation we owe debt of gratitude to all those afghans who be loyal to britain and who serve british aim in afghanistan and fail to find they appropriate accommodation and then kick they out on to the street be no way to repay that debt the reality be that the government have fail to keep the promise make to our afghan friend and that be shameful since december last year just four arap eligible principal along with dependant have be process and arrive in the uk out of the thousand who be wait that leave thousand of afghans flee the taliban stick in hotel in pakistan without hope or proper support can the minister clarify the exact number of afghans who have be rehouse into settle housing in the uk how many home be available for afghans to move into how many do he expect will be make homeless by the eviction notice that he have serve on these afghans know that the minister personal experience in afghanistan must weigh heavily upon he as the government evict so many afghans from hotel but we owe the people who be be evict debt of gratitude and we owe it to they to keep the promise that we have make minister must fix the broken arap scheme which along with the acrs have be plague by failure people in fear of their life have be leave in afghanistan housing promise have be break and processing staff have be cut from the ballooning backlog to the breach of personal datum and even the ministry of defence tell applicant that they should get the taliban to verify their arap application document the record be shameful the minister for veterans affairs be be use as human shield to deflect failure from the ministry of defence and across government how many arap eligible principal remain in pakistan and how many hotel be still be use as temporary bridging accommodation for afghan family will he publish constituency datum so that all member can understand whether he be evict people in their community he mention the afghan housing portal how many landlord have sign up to it how many have use it to house afghans and what promise by the ministry of defence have be keep in speed up and process arap case do not doubt the minister commitment to the people of afghanistan but this be not good enough the promise that we make as country be serious and solemn those who have flee from afghanistan deserve our support and gratitude eviction notice be not good enough if there be nowhere for they to go so can the minister give we his solemn promise that not single afghan who be currently in bridge accommodation will be homeless when the date of the eviction notice that he have serve upon they expire thank the hon member for his remark clearly do not think that be human shield for the government this be particularly difficult issue pay tribute to my hon friend the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins who grapple with this extraordinarily difficult and complex problem before have to say to the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard that this be one of the most generous offering that this country have ever make to resettle national from foreign country in the united kingdom since under consecutive conservative governments we have welcome more than half million people on country specific and humanitarian safe and legal route so just do not recognise his portrayal of the government attitude towards those who be resettle here we have work with around local authority across the united kingdom to meet the demand for housing as of datum publish on may around people have be support into settle accommodation around have move into home with an additional match but not yet move the hon member be right that from the end of april family start to receive legal notice to move that be accompany by million worth of new funding to enable local authority to provide the increase support for afghan household to move from hotel into settle accommodation the hon member have many question for and will write to he on the one that have miss but the truth be that this be an incredibly complex issue that the entire nation have duty to fulfil we can sling political remark across the dispatch box on this issue but we need all local authority and political leader in this country to pull together to challenge what be very difficult situation and to try to encourage these afghans to move in what be an extremely generous offer from central government into private rent accommodation we all have duty not to use these individual as political pawn but to provide they with life in the uk that we can be truly proud of if we all work together we can achieve that welcome my right hon friend to the dispatch box want to ask one simple question will no afghans to whom we owe debt of gratitude and honour be make homeless during the course of this process also want to ask peculiarly whether he have see the remark of our right hon friend the member for bournemouth east mr ellwood in afghanistan in which he refer to afghanistan as peaceful and stable and say that we should welcome that see that an afghan woman who will remain nameless promptly write on his twitter shocked afghan woman have be throw to the wolf and that be refer to as peace do the minister agree that it be not very welcome statement to have make give the terrible time that those woman have have and the persecution that have take place in afghanistan order can just check that the right hon member for bournemouth east mr ellwood have be inform can not find he well really it be discourteous with respect madam deputy speaker this statement be make in afghanistan and it be relevant to this chamber it have be impossible to contact my right hon friend the member for bournemouth east but hope respectfully that have the right to reference his statement because it have bearing on today ministerial statement if the right hon gentleman intend to refer to another member he should be courteous and inform they of that even by email which be sure be not impossible he be very experienced member of this house and he know that will email he immediately call the minister as have say many time from the dispatch box there be no reason why any of these individual should be homeless at the end of the process give what be on offer clearly we can not march people into accommodation if they choose to present themselves as homeless in an attempt to secure themselves some sort of other accommodation it be very difficult to affect that there be no tangible reason why any afghan family should present as homeless at the end of this process on my right hon friend remark on afghanistan and our right hon friend the member for bournemouth east mr ellwood be clear as be the government that the fall of afghanistan to the taliban be tragedy of epic human proportion fight the taliban myself the taliban murder my friend it be clear that the taliban represent serious threat to human right the treatment of woman and all the thing that we fight for that be the government position that remain unchanged and know that colleague from across the house will join in those sentiment let first clearly associate myself with the word of the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith be sure that the former chair of the defence committee the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis would never have go online and make the public statement that be make early today be dumbfound by they see the former chair of the defence committee present on the government benches thank the minister for advance sight of his statement know from our time together on the defence committee that this subject be close to his heart and that he have go the extra mile to ensure that we do well by those who risk so much alongside the uk armed force he serve in afghanistan as do my brother and government personnel be afraid though that while the minister speak warm word with good intention he have come up rather awkwardly against the fact which he have studiously avoid that accord to office for national statistics figure as think be mention previously only people have be able to apply through his government flagship afghan citizen resettlement scheme perhaps he could come back on that the scheme be mean to provide safe haven to the many thousand of afghans who be eligible to come to the uk but have not be able to do so at the time of operation pitting with the unacceptable backlog of afghans currently in the country along with the demonstrably obstructive barrier to those still suffer under the taliban rule from come here do the minister not agree that it be time for homes for afghans scheme similar to the homes for ukraine scheme which would give central government and local authority the impetus to ensure that permanent accommodation be find for all the afghans whom he seek to remove from hotel thank the hon gentleman for his question on the issue of acrs and arap need to be transparent with he my responsibility which this statement be about be for afghans in bridge accommodation in the uk and get they into accommodation the ministry of defence still own that arap pathway and be sure will have hear his question there be many more than recipient of the acr in this country and be more than happy to write to he to outline where they be at the moment his last point have slip my mind home for afghans yes we be look at similar proposal on home for afghans as we have for ukrainians but they be fundamentally different cohort ukrainians traditionally and in our experience tend to want to go back to ukraine in the future that be not the case with the afghan population we be certainly look at all option we have set up an afghan housing portal where landlord can offer their property and we can accept offer but all those option be in play it be fundamentally different cohort but we can get there in the end right hon friend focus on what central government have do and what local government need to do but there be no mention of third sector organisation what scrutiny have he give to the vulnerable person resettlement scheme to the community sponsorship scheme and to how the charitable sector might be able to step in and assist point in particular to the southampton winchester visitor group which be very active in my constituency but it be crucial that the government be prepared to look at all model to try to find solution so that afghan woman and child in particular who certainly would not find afghanistan peaceful and stable can find peace stability and home here my right hon friend be right if we be to be successful in this space we will have to harness the entire estate not only government local and national but third sector provision to be honest with she the good practice have see when have visit the hotel be where the third sector be deeply embed with the home office liaison team the department for work and pensions and the department for levelling up housing and communities official each of those team be now in those hotel every day and if there be charity out there who be willing to help and get involve ask they to contact their local home office liaison officer run each of the hotel there be lot of goodwill out there for the afghan community and we need to harness it third sector organisation and charity be hugely important part of that recently meet an year old constituent who be look after her old brother and her year old sister they have be separate from their parent for the past two year because in the scrum of the evacuation they make it on to the plane and their parent do not what can tell she and her sibling about the effort the government will be prepare to make to reunite they with their mum and dad the chaos of operation pitting mean that that situation be all too familiar for different family we be committed to reunite family where appropriate if the right hon gentleman write to about that specific case will look at it to restart the professional pipeline of arap applicant out of pakistan and back to the united kingdom it be incumbent on all of we to get afghans out of hotel if we can do that we can reunite family such as theirs and they can live good fulfil life integrate into uk society in may refer to the remarkable programme woman at war afghanistan by the courageous journalist alex crawford recommend that any member of this house who have doubt about the enslavement of woman in afghanistan take look at it refer to the resettlement within britain can the minister give we rough idea how many of the people concern be translator and thus have an adequate command of english suspect the vast majority do not and as third generation member of an immigrant family myself know that the key to successful integration be master the english language be there anything the minister can do to point those people in the direction of service that might be available to help they to do that pay tribute to my right hon friend for his long stand advocacy in this space esol english for speaker of other language course be available to every single person who come forward from operation pitting will be honest with he however the grasp of english be not where would like it to be some of these individual have be in hotel for two year those who have really throw themselves into the process of integration into the united kingdom have good grasp of english and be out work while some unfortunately have not match that effort and consequently can not speak english at this time there be clear measure build into the funding package to ensure that learn english and help this cohort to integrate into society be priority urge afghan family to take up that offer because it will make their life in the united kingdom and get job here so much easy start by thank the minister for his recent engagement and reiterate as one of the co chair in the all party parliamentary group on afghan woman and girl that he would be welcome to attend one of our meeting and speak directly to the woman and girl who join we many of the family unit in accommodation will be head by woman that be the reality of the devastating consequence of the conflict in afghanistan and the brutal taliban regime the minister mention in his remark support for those with medical requirement but give that those woman will have eld and childcare responsibility and their ability to exercise their right to work will be limited can he provide reassurance about what additional support be be give to they by the multidisciplinary team each individual afghan not each family be entitle to additional funding as they move into their receive local authority there be an ongoing programme of support for those individual the idea that this cohort can simply be abandon when we move they out of the hotel be clearly misguided have visit most of the hotel now and have not come across lot of female only lead family have meet one or two but where we see they we will do everything we can to support they hardly need remind the minister as he fight in afghanistan but will take the liberty of remind the house that we lose personnel kill in that theatre and thousand more unfortunately sustain life change injury the right hon member for bournemouth east mr ellwood be abroad on select committee trip but have communicate with he by text to give he notice that intend to mention he in the chamber so have observe the courtesy of the house last night follow visit to afghanistan he post an utterly bizarre video laud the taliban management of the country something fellow member of the defence committee describe to barely an hour ago as wish you be here video in which he make no mention of the fact that the taliban be still attempt to identify and kill afghan citizen who help our armed force or of the fact that young girl in afghanistan do not even have the right to go to school under that government wish to make plain on behalf of the committee that he be speak for himself even though he use the title of chairman of our committee in number of associate article not in our name he be entitle to have whatever bizarre opinion he want but do the minister agree that any select committee chairman who want to remain select committee chairman should be careful to make clear that he speak only for himself and not imply that he speak for number of other people who barely agree with word that he say thank my right hon friend for his moral clarity in this space member must be extremely careful to identify when they be speak for themselves and when they be represent group of individual and elect member of this house as say previously the government position remain unchanged the fall of afghanistan be tragedy we fight the taliban for many year and british service personnel lose their life in afghanistan in pursuit of freedom peace and woman right none of which be find in afghanistan today whenever we speak about that country we should bear that sacrifice in mind because it be an everyday occurrence for family up and down the country as chair of the home affairs committee feel that have well be very careful in how put this question but think that speak on behalf of the committee in november the then minister for afghan resettlement the hon member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins who see be in her place tell the home affairs committee in relation to the resettlement scheme for afghan refugee that the government want to ensure that any scheme we set up be future proof for the people of afghanistan since then the post of minister for afghan resettlement have be scrap and its successor post minister for refugees be currently vacant about afghan refugee have be strand in third country because they be tell that there be no suitable accommodation for they here and between january and march of this year afghan national constitute the majority of those make dangerous channel crossing in small boat up from in be there plan to fill the post of minister for refugees and will the minister confirm that after the enactment of the illegal migration bill afghans who come across in small boat include woman and child face detention and removal to third country possibly rwanda completely refute the characterisation of the work of my hon friend the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins get those afghans into community be incredibly complex and it require many government agency to pull together and deliver that be exactly what the prime minister appoint to do we be all well aware of what have happen under previous government but the issue now be that individual be in hotel which be not the right place for they to be the right hon lady be well aware of the issue that have come about because of prolonged hotel stay the offer that those individual have through the arap pathway be still open there be no requirement to take illegal route to this country the arap pathway can be apply to from third country the illegal migration bill be pass last night and we have numerous debate on that be clear that this be good offer for afghans who serve with british force in afghanistan and we all need to ensure that that offer be take up and that we integrate those people properly into our society may thank my right hon and gallant friend for come to chelmsford and meet the afghan family who be still in the atlantic hotel stay in hotel indefinitely do not give stability or security to any of those family and the government be right to give generous offer to help those family find themselves home nevertheless my chelmsford local authority say that the very generous per person be not enough to find rental accommodation in chelmsford but it be enough to find rental accommodation elsewhere in the country can he confirm that that amount of money can be transfer with the family should they want to go and rent elsewhere and ensure that that process be work for those family in chelmsford first believe that misunderstood the premise of what the chair of the home affairs committee the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson say think that she be give my hon friend the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins hard time but she be not apologise for misunderstanding when it come to chelmsford and various local authority have to be honest have see wildly differ spread in the application of the policy the truth be that in some local authority it be an extraordinary package that be have huge success we be see up front payment for six to month deposit pay and load on to credit card for people to go out and furnish their accommodation on top of that the per afghan not per family move with they to that local authority that be why there be no reason that any afghan should remain in hotel beyond august as say have not always see good application of the policy by local authority my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford will be well aware of what be speak about when take over this brief be very clear with the prime minister that we need to resource the policy correctly and he have resource it correctly we now need to be honest recognise that it be good offer and get those afghans out of hotel and properly integrate into the united kingdom which be the original promise of operation pitting let there be no doubt the situation of woman in afghanistan be dire know that do not have to tell the minister that he know it since the fall of afghanistan and other have be campaign for one particular group of woman former afghan judge and prosecutor who be leave behind and be live in fear of their life hide from the taliban last summer meet those at the fcdo who be very sympathetic to the idea of humanitarian visa for those woman and on may meet the prime minister who think seem very sympathetic to the idea on may be promise meeting by junior minister at the home office but that have not yet happen be there anything that the minister can do bear in mind his knowledge of the country and his appreciation of the issue to assist in put pressure on the home office to deliver humanitarian visa for at least some of those woman let take that away recognise the hon and learn lady concern and she make very valid point my responsibility in this area be clear to get afghans out of hotel and embed and integrate properly into uk society once that be do want to establish professional pathway out of afghanistan to ensure that we fulfil our duty to those we have make promise to that be sequential operation need to move the family refer to first but hear what she say and will take it away what step be my right hon friend take to ensure that those who can not move because of ongoing and acute medical treatment be not leave homeless when the access to hotel cease be that something on which local authority need to do lot more on local authority the truth be that as say in response to my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford there be disparity in the application of the policy across the country have see it do extremely well be in bristol near my hon friend constituency at the beginning of the week and pay tribute to anne james who have an extraordinary record of rehouse vulnerable people come to bristol from across the world that have prove to be really successful small number of individual receive specialist healthcare at hospital close to where they be currently house and there will be contingency for they but that be very small number for the vast majority there be no clear reason why they should not move out of hotel although we have an extremely generous offer we also need to be firm firm for the british taxpayer and for afghans and their family and ensure that we do this integration job properly thank the minister for visit my constituency last week and meet afghans and local official with he will have see clearly the commitment of the welsh government cardiff council and the vale of glamorgan council to work with his official to find solution to this the reality as he hear clearly in that meeting and as hear afterwards be that there have be wildly different experience across the uk of engagement and delivery on the offer that he have promise that be why some people will sadly end up need contingency accommodation as he set out hope that that be small number of people and know that the minister want to do his good to get those people out be that contingency accommodation in hotel will there be time limit on it will there be financial limit on it and will it be in the location where those afghans be currently house pay tribute to the hon gentleman for his engagement in the process we have useful although very short be afraid visit to his constituency to see the challenge there he be absolutely right the disparity in provision be obvious where he be we need to work hard in central government as well as at local government level to ensure that all the benefit of the scheme be play out for the family we be try to serve will have more to say in due course about contingency accommodation but clearly where individual be get specialist help at local hospital it will be in that area we be yet to make decision on precisely what that contingency accommodation will look like but as have say from the very start of the process do not want to see anybody go homeless at the end of the process nobody should be homeless can not march people to private accommodation and give they all the money in the world if they still do not want to live there but there be no reason why afghans should present as homeless at the end of this process while there be clear concern about what the minister have announce today it be important to recognise that there be two tier system in that many ten of thousand of afghans be currently stick in the uk asylum system many of they have be stick there for over two year they too want to move on with their life and be prevent from do so on the approach across government what representation can the minister make to his colleague in the home office to try to get those afghans out of the asylum system bear in mind that many of they will have serve with uk force in afghanistan or otherwise help our force application to the arap scheme by those who serve alongside british force and so on can be make from third country and at any stage the home office be deal with the asylum system at the moment and we have hear lot about that in the last couple of day my responsibility in this area be very clear and that be to get afghans who be already in hotel into their accommodation but be sure the home office will have hear the hon gentleman remark we be aware that this be hugely challenging space but hope that with this scheme the way we have work with local authority and the third sector and the fact that we have build an afghan taskforce for those who have already settle here and have charity work for the government we can set down really clear blueprint for how we do migration that could see we properly integrate people from these vulnerable situation into british society the minister make it sound ever so easy expect refugee to find their own accommodation with three month notice when they have be languish in hotel for nearly two year and this government have do nothing can the minister confirm that no afghan who serve alongside british troop in afghanistan will be make homeless as result of his decision to evict they from bridge hotel in liverpool we have family likely to be put on the street have make request on the floor of the house and in write to the minister to meet to talk about what be happen in liverpool and have not have response be sorry that the hon lady have not have response will look into that directly after this session be more than happy to meet at her early convenience to talk about these issue do not think have ever say that this be easy or will be simple project to achieve it be incredibly complex we have take around afghans out of afghanistan since op pitting that be huge number of people to push into an already overcrowded housing market they now have the most generous offer this country have ever make in the private rented sector and they get an extraordinary amount of assistance pay tribute to all the home office liaison officer and those work at the department for levelling up housing and communities who be on the frontline every day try to house afghan family in united kingdom society be more than happy to meet the hon lady to go over those detail with she where local authority engage with central government and my team we be have huge success and encourage she to do the same this be difficult process so it be inevitable that there will be significant number of afghans who struggle to find accommodation in time how will they be support to make homelessness application or to present as homeless will there be somebody physically evict people from hotel when the time come and if so who and what will then happen to the afghans and their belonging central government will stop pay for these hotel when the eviction notice run out there will then be extra homelessness funding for those who wish to present as homeless there be per family to help local authority look after they and get they out of hotel or homeless accommodation and into the private rent sector come back to this point have be to see some local authority and the no thing they have say to be can we keep the hotel open despite how bad that be for the afghan family and the kid who be not go to school and the challenge it pose in the community we have to move these afghans on we have to get they into private rent accommodation there be no reason why we can not do that and look forward to work with the hon gentleman in the month ahead to achieve that the minister official recently visit my constituency and they will be aware that there be grave concern regard the wellbeing and emotional welfare of the family involve what additional support be the government put in place to help with need that be not simply accommodation related furthermore it have be suggest that some of the same hotel will be stand up as contingency accommodation for asylum seeker can the minister respond be that the case be not in the home office so do not know which hotel will be stand up as contingency option for asylum seeker there be some really good practice go on in chester but there be also some extremely difficult situation the truth be that while some afghans have do an extraordinary job of try to integrate into and relocate to the united kingdom have meet some individual who have property here but choose to live in hotel and be send money back to pakistan and afghanistan while get food and accommodation in this country that be the reality of the situation while the number of those case be small we need to ensure that we be do everything we can to get afghans into sustainable accommodation look forward to work with the hon lady to achieve that objective think the minister for his statement five day ago the government publish their human rights and democracy report in which they refer to pathway and the commitment that be give it be nearly two year since the fall of kabul and month since the opening of pathway in that time few applicant have arrive in the uk many member of this house include the minister fight hard for the establishment of the pathway which be originally intend to support vulnerable group include ethnic and religious minority it be promise that people would be resettle in the uk under the scheme yet it appear that the number bring to the uk so far be minimal and application have not open for the original group give the finding of the hazara inquiry detail the escalate atrocity crime and warning of possible genocide why have the scheme be so slow to open and process people the acrs and arap process do not lie with the piece of work we be discuss today but be more than happy to take those point away in context this have be an extremely generous scheme recognise that there be an appetite to relocate everyone who serve in the afghan armed force for example we simply can not do that that be half million people we have special duty to those who serve alongside we and those in unit and who work with the uk special force community we be do everything we can to fulfil that but we have to be honest and realistic about what we can do in this space all can say to the hon gentleman be that the prime minister be absolutely determined to fulfil our commitment to these people that be what he say to when be ask to take this over and that be what he have demonstrate with the amount of money and resource he have direct at this if we all pull together and work together in local government national government and the third sector there be no reason why we can not successfully integrate this generation of afghans into british society today just last week constituent of mine who be british citizen of afghan descent be tell that after wait year for resolution to his family case due to absurd delay at the home office his five young child and wife would all be prevent from enter the uk he be tell that the document he hold be insufficient despite have provide dna evidence to the home office the reason his require document be not in the form they should have be in be that they be damage in devastating bomb blast at kabul airport something that my parliamentary staff can attest to because they be on the phone at the time of the bomb blast happen and have deal with this case from that awful day my question to the minister be quite simple what be my constituent able to do about that situation how can he work with our government to rightfully bring his family to this country without delay if that individual be eligible under arap or acrs and be approve the hon gentleman should write to about the case and will look into it the status of these individual be determine by the home office so that be question for that department but be more than happy to look into individual case as have say number of time this be an extraordinarily complex situation he allude to what happen at kabul airfield two year ago we be determined to ensure that those we owe duty to are bring back to this country and urge he to write to about that case today thank the minister for his statement the british red cross be deliver information session to afghan refugee on life in the uk digital safety and protection and woman healthcare what step be minister take to ensure that they too provide afghan refugee with the tool they require for successful assimilation in the uk there have be huge amount of work to make sure that afghans have absolutely everything at their disposal in order to integrate into the united kingdom include funding that be flexible enough to for example knock through house that be build together but not sized for the big family that we see in this cohort english course and training replicate the qualification they have in afghanistan and try to get they into the nhs there be wealth of opportunity out there for afghan family in the united kingdom today we must present that alongside compassionate but firm outlook that hotel be not the place for afghan family to reside in the long term that be why we have put so much money and effort into this we be determined to see through our commitment to this cohort and we will get there in the end thank the minister for his statement bill present members of parliament oil and gas companies bill presentation and first reading standing order no richard burgon present bill to require the leader of the house of commons to move motion prohibit member of parliament from receive any financial or other benefit from oil and gas company to require the leader of the house to publish proposal for divestment of the parliamentary contributory pension fund from oil and gas company and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on friday november and to be print bill high income child benefit charge report to parliament motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the chancellor of the exchequer to report to parliament on the likely effect of increase in line with inflation the income threshold for the high income child benefit charge and of determine that threshold by reference to household income instead of individual income thank the house for allow to present this ten minute rule bill give the timescale will attempt to be succinct most member of the house will have an understanding of why the democratic unionist party and other seek to present this bill today it be in the interest of fairness something that be always critical always key to everything do the high income child benefit charge be equal to of family child benefit for every of income that be over each year if an individual income be over the charge will equal the total amount of the child benefit that be how it be work out indeed that be how it have be work out since its introduction in january with not one single change the fact that the threshold for the charge have remain unchanged for year be incredible and not usual when it come to government threshold even the standard personal allowance for tax have rise by almost third during the same period in the interest of fairness should note that income tax threshold have be freeze in cash term since and it be government policy that they will remain frozen up to and include but in tandem with the child benefit freeze that mean that work family find themselves even hard press to pay the bill the question of why we be now face with an immovable child benefit threshold be difficult to answer when we consider that literally every other rate have fluctuate over that timespan the cost of the diesel that people need to get to work be up by litre since well over those who invest in electric car have see the price of electricity consumption increase from an average of in to the current price cap of increase be not limit to those essential use the consumer price index measure of inflation the tremendous staff of the library have work out that average price in the uk rise by from tax year to let we take moment to take that in an increase of that be substantial and wage have not increase at the same rate family wage may well have increase yet they be bad off because the bill they be pay cost more that wage increase may in turn preclude child benefit claim yet it be clear that for work family child benefit be more necessary than ever before the question that the treasury will be work out be this what would the threshold be if they be uprate with inflation as treasury ministers be aware the usual practice be that income tax threshold be uprate base on the annual inflation rate of cpi in the september prior to the start of the come tax year for example the threshold in tax year be determine by cpi inflation in september base on that practice if the threshold have be uprate in line with cpi inflation the low threshold of in would be in and the upper threshold of in would be in that be what the threshold should be but they be not we find ourselves in substantially different position that be one of the reason why have table this ten minute rule bill the government be aware of the issue indeed the minister and have speak about it before she be always very generous in her reply although not always with the answer be hop for hence why have table the bill have raise the issue during budget debate and other debate in westminster hall and the minister be quick to highlight that the charge affect small proportion of child benefit claimant namely those who have relatively high income think we have establish that the threshold be nowhere near the same rate that people be allow to earn when the charge be design in so the government must answer the question of whether it be stealth tax on the work middle class who can not be classify as rich by any stretch of the imagination or to ensure that those who do not need help do not get it the rationale behind apply child benefit threshold have be terribly blur by the refusal to uplift that threshold in line with inflation or indeed with common sense the minister have previously say that in only about individual in the uk declare hicbc liability and the vast majority of those individual have income above the uk high rate income tax threshold of the inference be that those people be rich and do not need help which be quite untrue with cpi increase of that argument do not carry weight for the family who pay per week for hour of childcare in but who now pay that be the inflation that be the cpi that be the problem if that family earn they certainly do not get child tax credit to help they those people be in ordinary job try their good to make their mortgage payment heat their home and educate their child without one penny from government over their child benefit since hicbc be introduce his majesty revenue and customs have also carry out compliance check on those who either do not register for self assessment to pay the charge or pay the incorrect amount on their self assessment tax return we start off with few thousand people be over the threshold but the number have escalate to check on those not register for self assessment and check on those who return the incorrect amount in before the pandemic that be not few family the scale of those compliance check illustrate the difference between the time when the charge be introduce in and the number of people who be now expect to fill out self assessment form without training or guidance they may even be pay an accountant to get it right for they due to their fear of get fine or black mark the bill also highlight the inconsistency of the fact that single income home have threshold of around yet couple in dual income household could be earn each that be in total and still receive their entitlement again this show the inconsistency of the government approach and the reason that this house must believe take the time to review the matter and get it right our middle class be struggle they be the one in every one of our constituency include the minister represent in this place work hard raise their child and try to give they opportunity in their life while all around they price have sky rocket they be the one who be discover how difficult it be to make end meet and who realise that if they gather their courage to ask for reasonable pay rise of couple of thousand pound most of it will be lose in tax and that with the miss child benefit the struggle will continue and they will be no far ahead they be the one that our party ten minute rule bill be advocate for for help and for change we have determine that there be minimum amount that people must have to live and to fill the gap can not for the life of fathom why the only group of people we do not seek to give hand up to be the work backbone of this country and the backbone by the way of every one of the party here as well the sum of be not what it use to be some people will say well actually if only we have that but it be the threshold be refer to we know that the value of money have change that be why everyone who would have earn in january when the charge be introduce now earn almost third more which be still not embrace by the minister and by the department time have change and so too must the child benefit threshold today lie this bill before the house for

government amendment and in lieu of lords amendment lord amendment government motion to disagree and government amendment to to the word so restore to the bill lord amendment to to to and to lord amendment and government consequential amendment to lords amendment be delighted to speak to this bill follow its year long passage through the other place pay tribute to lord caine for his expert stewardship of the bill in that place as well as to all the opposition spokespeople for their patience and engagement on the bill hon and right hon member will know all too well that the legacy of the trouble remain one of the outstanding issue since the belfast good friday agreement be reach in as government we have seek to make realistic assessment of what we can do to well deliver for those affect by the trouble over quarter of century after that agreement and well over year since the trouble begin recognise and know the house recognise that this be hugely difficult task that be reflect in the many valiant attempt make to address this issue since the signing of the belfast good friday agreement all those year ago it be also incumbent on we to ensure that any process for deal with the past focus on measure that can deliver positive outcome for as many of those directly affect by the trouble as possible as well as for society in northern ireland as whole we maintain that the bill before we be the good way of do that the bill contain finely balanced political and moral choice that be uncomfortable for many but we should be honest about what we can realistically deliver for people in northern ireland in circumstance where the prospect of achieve justice in the traditional sense be so vanishingly small the bill seek to deliver an approach that focus on what can practically be achieve to deliver well outcome for all those who suffer include those who serve and it aim to help society look forward together to more shared future the bill leave the house of commons over year ago in that time my ministerial colleague and have hold more than meeting with victim group veteran group northern ireland political party the opposition the irish government academic us interlocutor and member of both houses in an effort to make meaningful change to improve the bill as result of that extensive engagement the government have bring forward significant package of amendment that provide great assurance regard compliance with our international obligation enhance the independence of the new independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery will call that by its catchy nickname icrir from here on provide much great focus on the interest of victim and family and strengthen provision relate to the process of grant immunity from prosecution to those who engage meaningfully with the commission while keep open the possibility of prosecution for those who fail to do so let run through the government lord amendment thematically as well as our response to lords amendment and first there be conditional immunity and incentive to co operate with the icrir as say from the outset the aim of the bill be to provide more information to more people than be possible under current mechanism and we will do that by create an effective information recovery process the commission will conduct review with the primary purpose of provide answer to those who want they and will grant immunity from prosecution only if individual provide an account that be true to the good of their knowledge and belief know that be challenge for many but conditional immunity be crucial aspect of the information recovery process the government believe it be the good mechanism by which we can generate the great volume of information in the quick possible time to pass on to family and victim who have be wait for so long that be why the government can not accept lords amendment which seek to remove clause and conditional immunity from the bill as many member of the house will know there be significant precedent regard limited immunity and amnesty in northern ireland and in the republic of ireland follow period of violence that include follow the belfast good friday agreement an amnesty for the decommissioning of paramilitary weapon and limited immunity for individual who share information about the location of victim remain if we look back far the newly create irish state legislate three time between and for amnesty dispense with civil and criminal liability for violence for uk state force republicans and free state force through government amendment we be make the conditional immunity process more robust that include amendment to clause in my name which be agree in the other place but fall when the clause be remove from the bill the commission be already require to consider all relevant information that it hold when form view on the truth of person account as part of their application for immunity include information obtain through related review through lords amendment we be strengthen that provision by place the commission under positive duty require it to take reasonable step to secure information relevant to that assessment the government be far strengthen the immunity provision by introduce circumstance under which immunity may be revoke or may not be grant have restore lords amendment which make it clear that where person apply for immunity be subject to an ongoing prosecution immunity may not be grant if there be risk that it might prejudice that ongoing prosecution through lords amendment we be create new criminal offence for those who wilfully or recklessly choose to mislead the commission when provide information individual who be grant immunity will automatically lose it if they be convict of such an offence can the secretary of state confirm to the house how many ongoing ira trial be take place vis vis how many ongoing trial against member of the security service be take place do not have those figure with but will get they from my official and give they to the hon gentleman when with the leave of the house reply to the debate later build on what be just outline lords amendment ensure that grant of immunity must be revoke if an individual be subsequently convict of terrorism offence or offence connect to terrorism commit after the immunity have be grant that include offence relate to fundraising involvement in terrorist fundraising arrangement and the encouragement of terrorism and dissemination of terrorist publication the offender will also be preclude from obtain immunity for offence within the scope of the revoke grant we be also disapplye the northern ireland sentences act for future conviction that mean that individual who choose not to engage fully with the commission and be not grant immunity but who be subsequently convict of an offence will not be able to apply for early release and will be liable to serve full sentence thank my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for raise that issue before the bill leave the commons this time last year alongside that have listen to suggestion in the debate in this house we be increase the financial penalty for non compliance with the commission from up to to up to which be in line with the ask during this bill passage the secretary of state say that it have take year for the bill to go through the house of lords and other campaign for four year for the bill even to be introduce in the first place fear that some of the government own amendment introduce in the other place have have the effect of swing the pendulum too far admit it be delicate balance against our veteran who serve in operation banner in northern ireland specifically the bill now give the independent commission extremely wide and latitudinal power to decide whether veteran should still be investigate even despite the bill so call double jeopardy provision the decision still ultimately lie with the commission it also have great latitude in decide whether veteran have comply with an investigation which would then allow they immunity they would not get it if the commission rule they have not comply can the secretary of state absolutely assure in his heart of heart that we be not institutionalise the mechanism for republican lawyer which would be totally contrary to the whole point of bring in the bill in the first place be great believer in short and honest answer to such question and the answer be yes now turn to the conduct of review by the commission and in particular lords amendment which establish minimum standard for review conduct by the icrir to ensure that conduct be investigate to criminal justice standard along the line of operation kenova will the secretary of state give way the right hon gentleman really do have to be pithy than he be in his last intervention by their very nature intervention should be short thank the secretary of state for that clear answer but could he just with couple of sentence pithily explain why he be so confident that he be right will turn to element of this later in my speech but refer early to the importance of the conditional immunity clause think what my right hon friend will hear in the course of this debate be how many people think the pendulum have swing in this delicate balance as he have put it too far in the opposite direction to the way he believe it have swing the secretary of state will be aware that it be back in april that the then defence committee first recommend draw line with statute of limitation couple with truth recovery process we recognise that the process have to be for everyone or for no one do he accept that there be risk of have overcomplicate the process and be any remedy likely to be available if in put this into practice it be find that service personnel be not be sufficiently protect for ongoing prosecution there be obviously no statute of limitation the bill have move on and as say would like to think it have be improve great deal but it will be an independent body that allow for these thing to happen that be vital both in deal with the issue of the past as my right hon friend outline and in help all victim perhaps to get some information about the circumstance by which they lose love one or other we recently hold the memorial concert for the deal marine musician who be murder by the ira bomb in deal in no one have ever be bring to justice for that will my right hon friend confirm that the process will apply across the whole of the united kingdom what information can we hope might come forward that have not already do so in more than year in answer to my hon friend first question confirm the geographical jurisdiction on her second question it rather depend on the evidence that might be hold by individual or organisation know that the case she raise have be subject to number of past investigation and there be limited information in the public domain the secretary of state mention the issue of all the victim the justice that many victim want be quite clear to and to other on the opposition side of the chamber think my hon friend the member for east londonderry mr campbell have say that even if there be only candle of light of possibility for justice some day we would all want to see that want to see that for all the people know the secretary of state will remember how last time we speak on this name every one of those people who we really feel justice be not there for whenever he talk about justice for all do not see it and my people do not see it where be it it be contain within the bill and within the independence of the commission which will be able to conduct criminal investigation when the family ask it to do so have meet numerous family in my time as secretary of state for northern ireland and there be complete range of view as to what people want when it come to seek information about what happen to their love one know as mention at the top of my speech that the bill will not satisfy everybody however lot of time have pass the hon gentleman will know that well than most and there be now dwindle opportunity for investigation lead to criminal prosecution people do need to have information if it can possibly be find fifty one year ago my cousin kenneth smyth be kenneth smyth be murder his friend daniel mccormick roman catholic be also murder fifty one year later there be no justice for my family and no justice for daniel mccormick family and there be no justice for the four ulster defence regiment man murder in ballydugan or for the young lad stuart montgomery also murder our pain be still here our pain be still raw our people grieve my constituent grieve the secretary of state say that they will have justice but we can not see justice the people who kill my cousin three of they run across the border and get sanctuary in the republic of ireland two of they be dead and one be still live there be no justice nine people be involve in the murder of those four udr man and one of they be dead today it be in the paper this week colum marks an ira commander he be in hell burn the good place for he where be the justice for my family and for my constituent do not see it the secretary of state say we be go to have it no we be not do not see it at all first completely recognise the emotion with which the hon gentleman have express his view he know that have meet huge number of people who have reflect with passion on the people they have lose can not put myself in the hon gentleman shoe would not try to and nor can right the wrong of something that happen year ago the hon gentleman family have go without justice or much information for year he know that unlike he there be family across the piece some of whom be his constituent who have not have any information about the circumstance in which they lose love one during the course of the trouble this bill be definitely not perfect but after year should people choose to use the power of the independent commission in this legislation they might just able to get some information that allow they to remember their love one in the appropriate way my heart go out to the hon gentleman know that this be an imperfect bill for he but it might just work for some other this piece of legislation be difficult balancing act be talk about lords amendment which raise number of important issue that have be address by government amendment table in the other place and for commons consideration we can not accept any amendment that seek to make every review criminal investigation the legislation rightly ensure that the independent commission via the commissioner for investigation have the flexibility to determine if and when it be appropriate to utilise police power during the course of its review one size fit all approach require criminal investigation in all case would remove such flexibility and significantly increase the likely time to complete review far delay the provision of information for many family point to case raise with in oral question only few week ago by my hon friend the member for wrexham sarah atherton should anyone not believe that such investigation be useful far in case where the investigative duty under article or of the convention apply criminal investigation may not be sufficient mean of discharge that duty that be because there may have be failing by the state that contribute to death but which be not themselves criminal in nature lord amendment also seek to introduce reference to compliance with the european convention on human right as public authority for the purpose of section of the human rights act the icrir and its commissioner be require to be compatible with convention right within the meaning of the act when exercise their function under the bill government lords amendment and expressly confirm that the commissioner for investigation must comply with obligation impose by the human rights act when exercise operational control over the conduct of review and other function lord amendment reference gathering as much information as possible and explore all evidential opportunity the commissioner for investigation be require to ensure not only that review be carry out when valid request be receive but that each review look into all the circumstance of the death or incident question include but not limit to criminal activity furthermore as set out lords amendment will place the commission under positive duty to take reasonable step to secure information for that assessment to strengthen far our commitment around the conducting of review have table amendment in lieu of lords amendment which seek to clarify that the duty of the commissioner for investigation when look into the circumstance of death or serious injury apply regardless of whether criminal investigation form part of the review they also place duty on the chief commissioner to provide where possible answer to question pose as part of request for review sinn féin have always argue that because in the early year of the trouble fatal shooting by armed force personnel be investigate by the royal military police and only after few year be that transfer to the ruc those investigation be not article compliant as the government have deliberately strengthen the role of article via their own amendment do that mean in practice that every single fatality prior to be likely to be reinvestigate in order to be article compliant no turn now to the role of victim and family sorry do the minister want to explain that will happily explain bit later when have finish what be say turn now to the role of victim and family through our extensive engagement with stakeholder we have seek to make the bill more victim centre to achieve that be place the commission when exercise its function under duty to have regard to the general interest of person affect by trouble relate death and serious injury the bill will also make it clear that in exercise its function the commission principal objective be to promote reconciliation that be crucial overarching principle that will embed the need to promote reconciliation in everything the icrir do when carry out its work the commission will also be place under new duty to offer victim and their family the opportunity to submit personal impact statement set out how they have be affect by trouble relate death or serious injury the statement must be publish if the person make the statement so wish subject to limited exception that ensure no individual be put at risk and that the government duty to keep people safe and secure be uphold we table the amendment as direct result of engagement with the commissioner for victims and survivors in northern ireland who maintain it be crucial that victim have voice in this process we agree the government fully recognise the need for the commission to have credibility expertise and legitimacy so that effective investigation can be carry out and information provide to family as soon as possible on may announce the intend appointment of the former lord chief justice of northern ireland sir declan morgan kc as chief commissioner designate have obtain input from the lord chief justices of northern ireland and england and wales and the lord president of the court of session in scotland all of whom would like to thank publicly to allay further concern around the integrity and independence of the immunity process the government lords amendment place duty on the commission to produce guidance that be relate to determine request for immunity that will replace the power that previously rest with the secretary of state for northern ireland there be also amendment relate to oral history and memorialisation we be be afraid never go to agree in northern ireland on common narrative about the past but we can aim to put in place structure to help all in society include future generation have well understanding of the past with the overarching aim of enable people to move forwards therefore our memorialisation strategy will seek to build consensus around inclusive new initiative to commemorate those lose in the trouble and seek to ensure that lesson of the past be not forget fully understand concern raise regard the need to prevent the glorification of terrorism in relation to the memorialisation strategy and other measure in part as result we have add an overarching requirement to clause so that designated person must have regard to the need to ensure that the way in which the trouble relate work programme be carry out promote reconciliation anti sectarianism and non recurrence we also amend the bill to broaden the requirement to consult the first minister and deputy first minister with duty to consult organisation that be experience in reconciliation and anti sectarianism and to consult relevant northern ireland departments before decide on response to each recommendation in the memorialisation strategy we add an additional requirement in clause that the secretary of state must consult organisation that have an expertise in reconciliation and anti sectarianism before designate person for the purpose of this part of the bill there be also government amendment relate to interim custody order we have make the amendment in response to concern raise by member of both houses over the supreme court ruling concern the validity of the interim custody order make under the trouble era internment legislation to be clear it have always be the government understand that interim custody order make by ministers of the crown under power confer on the secretary of state be perfectly valid in order to restore clarity around the legal position and to make sure that no one be inappropriately advantage by different interpretation of the law on technicality the government table amendment that retrospectively validate all interim custody order make under article of the detention of terrorists northern ireland order as well as paragraph of section of the northern ireland emergency provisions act that have the effect of confirm that person detention under an ico be not unlawful simply because it have be authorise by junior minister rather than by the secretary of state personally the secretary of state have make an important point about the adams case and the disregarding of the carltona principle by the supreme court in and he be right to affirm the government view that the signing of warrant by minister of the crown be always lawful act but why have this take three year and why do the amendment originate from the back benches rather than the government be the secretary of state right to describe they as government amendment for great many people in northern ireland who think that this be welcome step during bill passage it come rather late well perhaps it be case of well late than never these be government amendment but be the first to admit that amazingly good idea sometimes emerge from the back benches of both houses of parliament the amendment could also prohibit certain type of legal proceeding include civil case application for compensation as result of miscarriage of justice and appeal against conviction which rely on the ruling from be bring or continue to align with the other prohibition in the bill the continuation of pende claim and appeal in scope would be prohibit immediately from commencement there be specific exemption in the bill for certain type of ongoing criminal appeal where leave to appeal have already be grant or where there have be referral by the criminal cases review commission by the time of the bill commencement the exception would not allow for the payment of compensation flow from the reversal of such conviction and want to make it clear that the amendment would not lead to the reinstatement of conviction that have already be reverse there be other amendment relate to criminal justice outcome the government primary focus have always be on establish one effective legacy body seek to provide well outcome for family we also want to ensure that organisation such as the police service of northern ireland the police ombudsman for northern ireland and the judiciary be able to concentrate their capability on more present day issue it remain our view that the independent commission when establish should be the sole body responsible for trouble relate case but we be also mindful of the concern raise about the ending of the ongoing process especially give the current legislative timetable and the expect timeframe for the commission become fully operational our amendment would therefore ensure that ongoing criminal investigation ombudsman investigation the consideration of prosecution decision coronial inquest and the publication of report will continue until may when the commission will become fully operational we hope that the additional time provide will allow such case to conclude their work while ensure smooth transition between the ending of the current mechanism and the commission take on full responsibility for outstanding legacy case do the secretary of state recognise the huge concern feel by family who do not think it be practical to expect all inquest to be complete by next spring some have not even begin and it be fear that two tier approach will emerge owe to number of factor some case schedule by the former lord chief justice will have start and may well finish while other have not even have chance to start notwithstanding what the secretary of state have say people do not believe that the new process will have the rigour of an inquest our amendment provide until may for inquest to conclude since the bill introduction expeditious case management of inquest in order to reach an advanced stage have result in the overloading of system that be already struggle under incredible pressure cause delay and frustration we hope that the amendment will ensure that resource will now be focus on complete those inquest that have realistic prospect of conclusion in the next year the government expect trouble relate case that do not conclude via the coronial process by may to be transfer to the fully operational icrir lead by sir declan morgan as chief commissioner designate through the use of provision already contain in the bill and believe that those provision will allow he to maintain the relevant level of investigation the secretary of state be very kind and generous to give way before he conclude would he care to mention any response to the irish government threat that they intend to take his majesty government to court on these matter how do he view that threat and what have be the response back to the irish government give their own dire record of deal with legacy thank the hon gentleman for his question there have be number of quite forthright conversation between the taoiseach the tanaiste and myself on this matter obviously anything could be test in legal action as we move forward but believe that the bill be article compliant do not see that as negative because there be five element to article compliance independence capability of lead to the identification and punishment of perpetrator prompt and reasonably expeditious involvement of next of kin and degree of public scrutiny which think be all include in this so think we be in strong place to resist any such potential charge and would like to think that mean that we can happily move on together have be wait patiently for the secretary of state to answer the question that ask he early about the interrelationship between article and investigation be sure he mean to answer the question before he sit down he have very few bit of paper leave could he now please give direct answer to my question about the interrelationship between the two think my hon friend will remember that give he direct answer and he want something that be bit long have just give he something that be bit long that identify why there be article compliance and we do directly which think be the good way of deal with this it do not answer my question order the icrir have always as public body need to comply with all its duty under the human rights act we have make it clear on the face of the bill that the commissioner for investigation must comply with those duty when carry out their review it be very straightforward it generally be straightforward answer to straightforward question and hope that my hon friend when he read hansard will see that his question have be answer threefold in what have say no they have not there you go we beg to differ finally through these amendment the term the relevant day have be remove from the bill so consequential amendment to lords amendment in my name simply seek to remove the power to define the relevant date be very confident that the government legacy bill provide the framework that will enable the independent commission establish by the bill to deliver effective legacy mechanism for family and victim whilst comply with our international obligation when the bill become law the delivery of those mechanism will be lead by sir declan morgan kc currently chief commissioner designate of the independent commission sir declan be also an individual of the high calibre with track record of delivery on legacy issue and know that he will approach the task with the rigour integrity and professionalism require the challenge before we be immensely difficult but it be also clear if we be to place the legacy of the trouble in the rear view mirror and to help all in society to move forward in spirit of reconciliation we must try to do thing differently the bill have manage to unite all northern ireland party in opposition to it the word reconciliation may be in its title but victim say that it be traumatise both the northern ireland human rights commission and the law society of northern ireland have criticise it the labour party have vote against it at every stage that be because it benefit terrorist more than their victim anyone doubt that should read the bbc front page today and the story about louie johnston who be just seven year old when his royal ulster constabulary officer father david johnston be shoot by the ira louie have ask mps to show empathy with his family today and not force through this bill lord amendment address the flaw at the centre of this bill by remove the immunity clause the government must not put immunity back in it be not wreck amendment as the independent commission would have well chance of win people over without it listen with interest to the secretary of state recent speech to the institute for government he tell story about meet three ruc widow and how all three want different thing in relation to their husband death he say that if he be member of the public he would side with the widow who want justice above all else he suggest that conditional immunity in exchange for information would satisfy two of the three widow and he say this be progress on legacy be intrigue to hear the leader of the opposition publicly state last week that if he be to become prime minister he would repeal this act this surprise for variety of reason and wonder if the shadow minister might indulge for second be right in think that public protestation mean labour have no intention of draw line under legacy issue in northern ireland and move on and do it mean that labour have no wish to stop vexatious complaint be make against british serviceman labour believe in more consensual way forward we believe that in the past there have be agreement that draw more consensus this government publish bill that have broad agreement in northern ireland and be deem human right compliant yet they jettison the bill after gain all that consensus and choose different way forward we believe the way forward lie in the origin of that draft legislation and we believe there be way forward that take into account the learning since the hon gentleman mention vexatious litigation against former servicepeople in the northern ireland context perhaps he could give an example of vexatious litigation where someone be currently be prosecute or pursue as result officer dennis hutchings okay will move on the secretary of state have clearly be try to do his good with bill he inherit from one of his predecessor but this bill will slam shut the door to justice it be now well over year since the bill be publish in that time ministers have have ample opportunity to consult the secretary of state outline dozen of meeting and he have have the chance to consult and listen to victim their representative and local northern irish politician that be ample opportunity to win the people over to the government approach yet nobody have be win over no politician no victim no international partner no one immunity from prosecution for murder would work only if it have popular support in northern ireland it do not the government have underestimate the strength of feeling among victim have be ask by some victim to put their view on the record on august john molloy have nearly reach his home in north belfast when he be confront by group of young man and woman john be catholic he be repeatedly stab in frenzied attack and be leave to bleed to death on the pavement he be just year old john still grieve parent pat and linda want to know how offer his killer immunity will aid they in reconciliation we be try to heal division but this bill be damaging take the case of cecil caldwell year old construction worker who be travel in minibus from omagh where he and his colleague have be repair an army base roadside bomb be detonate kill eight of the people on the bus as the dead and die lie on the road their pay packet be steal simple dignified monument be erect at the site and it be regularly vandalise cecil wife jean do not want this legislation she have ask whether the government have any idea of what victim have go through if the bill be not an aid to victim such as she what be the point clearly the government be also conflict in the other place amendment be introduce to stop gerry adams receive compensation follow supreme court ruling in we support the upholding of the carltona principle and that amendment however there be disconnect between the horror the government feel at the idea of give gerry adams compensation and the potential implication of the immunity clause we be debate want to explore that in hypothetical gerry adams have of course always deny be member of the ira but he be currently be sue in the high court by victim of the ira in civil case not only will this bill halt any similar case but the immunity provision remain open to gerry adams if he be ever to need they immunity be worth lot more than compensation in this hypothetical should gerry adams seek to avail himself of immunity nothing in this bill could prevent it and the people support the bill would be the very first one on their foot scream for emergency measure to prevent it from happen even if we choose to ignore the moral problem of this policy there be also doubt about it on the government own term member need not take my word for it because this be the view that sir declan morgan give to the northern ireland affairs committee last year the house will know that sir declan have be name as the chief commissioner of the independent body he say the only group who will go for immunity be those who have be the subject of investigation bring in for questioning and it look like there be viable case it seem to like that be vanishingly small number of people again the question then arise of why you would put immunity in place for such small number of people in the circumstance you must be able to justify that that present challenge do not have reason to believe that sir declan view on the number of people who will go for immunity have change since his appointment immunity can not be justify when the rest of the bill shut process down which have work for some victim will the minister give way shadow minister for the time be be go to make that clear in my comment thank the shadow secretary of state for what he be say understand entirely what motivate my colleague on the other side of the house who serve in the armed force have the honour of serve in the ulster defence regiment but here be the problem for for all those whom we be seek to protect from prosecution there be countless other who put on uniform of the crown in the armed force and in the royal ulster constabulary and be murder in cold blood by terrorist and whose family will not now have the opportunity of justice can not look those people in the eye louie johnston be one of my constituent and the shadow secretary of state refer to he recall have just be elect member of parliament in and the news come through about the murder of his father constable david johnston and of constable john graham in lurgan louie be in my office recently and the current system be not deliver for he we do need change we need system that can deliver but surely it be the victim who should have the choice surely it should be down to the family to choose whether they want to pursue justice or information when we deny they that route and we take away the access to justice we diminish the prospect of achieve the second objective of this bill which be reconciliation the right hon member make his point passionately with great erudition and personal experience as the representative of the lagan valley there be very little can add to the insight that he have just give the house we in this place have strive in recent year to give extra right to victim indeed the victims and prisoners bill be pass through the house believe it have just pass committee stage in england and wales we be pass legislation that give more right to victim only in northern ireland be we do something that disempower victim and put in place set of institution that will make it immeasurably more difficult for victim to get the reconciliation that they so desperately deserve so have complete sympathy with the right hon member let address an intervention from the hon member for north antrim ian paisley who ask about the number of prosecution currently under way regard veteran and terrorist in the time of the trouble to the good of my knowledge two case be outstanding and ongoing relate to veteran soldier and soldier but there be case file currently with prosecutor in northern ireland relate to act of terror those case be not be push forward because prosecutor lack the resource which they have repeatedly ask government for to pursue those prosecution those resource be not forthcoming but there be lot of case that could be move forward that we be not resource to progress right now thank the shadow secretary of state for emphasise that point because it highlight the folly of the decision take by some people in this house to support this legislation because it will protect our boy the fact of the matter be that the only ongoing case that have any likely prospect of get to trial be case against our boy none of the case against terrorist will ever be able to get to court and more importantly the immunity provision will exclude former security personnel from benefit from they member should think again about why they be support those measure be grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention these be very difficult issue and of course understand why people want to speak in support of people who have serve in our armed force feel this intensely and strongly myself come from family where one of my parent my father serve in our armed force will come to the issue again later in my speech but will go into it in some detail now the only recent case against member of our armed force be that of david holden member of the grenadier guards and it be worth reflect on the judge sum up in that particular case paragraph of the judgment say instead accord to his frankly incoherent evidence he put his right hand on the pistol grip which somehow result in his finger slip onto the trigger and do so with the significant pressure require to fire the weapon do not believe that evidence conclude that it be deliberately false account of what happen paragraph say to summarise the conclusion above find that it be prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant lie repeatedly to the police if this case have come to light after the bill have pass prosecution would not have be possible do not believe for second that this case and the person responsible david holden reflect the value that we expect from those who serve in our armed force and that the vast majority of people who serve in our armed force expect from their fellow member after five year the bill provide general amnesty for anyone and everyone as the independent body will wind up all other investigation inquest and civil case will be shut down it be clear that the government have choose immunity to satisfy some on their own benches they say veteran face witch hunt in northern ireland that be the phrase use by the right hon member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis do not believe that that be the way that we should frame or explain the reconciliation challenge of northern ireland the vast majority of our soldier serve with distinction in the most difficult of circumstance there can be no equivalence draw between their action and those of terrorist but that be precisely what this bill do where standard be not uphold it be important that there be accountability there have be total of six military personnel charge with offence relate to the trouble two of which case be currently ongoing what have change since this bill inception be that there have now be conviction of the former grenadier guardsman david holden for the manslaughter of aidan mcanespie we can not ignore the fact that this bill be design to stop the outcome that the mcanespie family finally achieve also wish to put it on the record that veteran be victim too the ira shoot private tony harrison five time in the back while he be sit on the sofa at his fiancée home in east belfast in his family have be clear that they do not want immunity for his killer would be lot more sympathetic with the government if their approach have be to try to secure justice for more not few people this bill will affect the entire united kingdom and our reputation abroad the family of the victim of the ira birmingham pub bombing have be clear that they do not want immunity to be on offer in november the chief constable of west midlands police confirm that file have be pass on to the crown prosecution service immunity will be open to that suspect if this bill pass before decision be make vote down lords amendment could shut off justice for family who have wait year right at their moment of great hope there be still time for the government to pause and reconsider this approach just as the irish government have formally request the anniversary of the good friday agreement be the moment to reflect on the power of consensus to pass this bill with immunity would be to fly in the face of everything that we know about progress in northern ireland it should not happen do not intend to spend long on my foot as have make all the point that would seek to make on this bill at previous stage it be also important that we get to hear as many voice as possible from northern ireland will make just two point first that reconciliation be something that be achieve not impose and secondly to hold fast the principle that where there be sufficiency of evidence and an independent prosecutor decide that it be in the public interest prosecution should be able to go ahead that be why the snp continue to oppose the bill notwithstanding the amendment that be on the table today echo the point make by the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson that without that ability to pursue justice reconciliation become less likely appreciate very much the step that the ministerial team this iteration of it have make in seek to address the concern that have be raise but that fundamental point of principle about deny prosecution and therefore in our view justice remain that be why my party will support lords amendment this afternoon we also support lords amendment we think that operation kenova set the gold standard for the investigative process that should be carry out and particularly the commitment by the government to pursue all evidential opportunity the secretary of state have be keen to stress that he be offer great assurance on echr compliance have to say that we remain without the assurance that we need and if lords amendment be to be put to the vote tonight the snp would certainly support it rise we have seven member who wish to speak will impose seven minute time limit to make sure that everybody get in appreciate the brevity with which the hon member for gordon richard thomson speak and the fact that member from all party represent northern ireland will have the opportunity to speak thank the secretary of state for at least engage in the debate in way that be constructive non combative and as compassionate as possible as believe he have this afternoon that have be markedly absent from some previous debate on the bill that be not lead by he the secretary of state be right that different victim have different approach victim be frustrate with the continuous obnoxious attitude that it be information that they need for some that be undoubtedly true but many other know exactly who perpetrate act of violence against their family they know exactly which neighbour in their community be responsible for take the life of their love one it be not an answer that they seek it be justice thank the secretary of state and the government for accept many of the amendment that we table last year he mention the repeal of the northern ireland sentences act provision and wrongly credit one of his colleague that be an amendment table by my colleague and the increase in fine be also beneficial to the bill the ability to revoke immunity should somebody obtain it through deception deceit and lie be good that provision be table in the house of commons the government commit to deliver it in the house of lords and we be grateful that they do so the government also make commitment on the amendment to clause that we table in the commons and they deliver on it in the lords all those amendment be beneficial but none of they remove the irredeemable quality of the bill have hear people particularly in the other place describe our position as populist and refer as the secretary of state do to previous effort let be clear colleague who predate my time in this house colleague in my party and in other party represent here stand against on the run legislation as something that be immoral under the labour government and actively oppose the conservative government when it be show that they have be provide letter of comfort to terrorist we do so because the government position be immoral today we say that the bill be irredeemable not because we be populist on this issue but because we be principle on it the quest for justice be it from last week last year or year ago be as important for those affect by the vagary of terrorism today as it be at the time of their loss we do not believe that the government have go far enough on the provision regard the glorification of terrorism the bill be about bring community together and resolve the issue of the past not absolve individual of their crime and ignore the memory and hurt of victim as mention be pleased that the government resolve the compensation issue relate to the adams case be sorry to say that although they have take step to consider some of the aspect of investigation that touch on criminality and have move some way in their position in response to lords amendment for we they have not move far enough whether the bill and the government action be compatible with their obligation under the european convention on human right will ultimately be matter for the court but it do not pass our smell test for what we believe be righteous or just that be why we will vote against the government when it come to lords amendment we will vote against the ability to offer immunity to terrorist and to ensure that they never face justice for their crime and subsequently to give they the ability to talk openly and freely about their exploit as those who have already be convict do we do not need crystal ball to guess that people who be unencumbered by the justice system will have the freedom not only to share their experience but to torment their victim and their victim love one far that be the true reality of what will happen because glorification of terrorism have not be satisfactorily address in the government amendment the government continually chide northern ireland party for not reach agreement on issue that have plague our society for decade yet in we have agreement on stormont house arrangement that be not easy it be fraught with difficulty and there be many compromise by all party contain within those proposal yet it be an agreement that we reach and that the government disregard seven year later we be still struggle to comprehend and understand the approach that the government be take for the victim in my community and the victim throughout northern ireland who know exactly what happen but want the government to stand with they in their pursuit of the rule of law and of consequence for criminal act and for remove life this bill and these amendment do not go far enough to satisfy their very human and very just quest in which we continue to support they unlike some of the people who have be involve in this debate more recently who have leave the chamber of course we care about the victim and we want to put the victim at the heart of all this have be work on this issue for about year know many of those victim they be not people who want to live in the past they be people who want well future but unless we deal with this issue they will never be able to have the reconcile future that they crave the bill be licence for impunity and signal to other country that they can murder their own citizen and get away with it but mostly it be legislation write in very dark corner of the british establishment to ensure that light be not shine into those corner the secretary of state tell we he have have lot of meeting and be sure he have he have meet victim group human right group the united states administration and european politician and he have meet all of we would love to know whether he come away from any one of those meeting with the impression that people actually want this bill as the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson say we do have an agreement not only be we agree that we be oppose to the bill but we be agree that stormont house be the way to carry out this process to pretend that we have all be fight over this issue for the last seven or eight year be just nonsense moreover the pretence that the bill be about allow people to get to the truth be quite easily debunk remember the bloody sunday inquiry the soldier be offer immunity within that inquiry and they lie through their tooth if hon member do not believe they should read the saville report one after another they lie through their tooth the notion that if we give people immunity they will all of sudden come and tell we all they know be just not practical or realistic do not believe victim will engage in that process also want to say something about the nonsense that we have all these vexatious prosecution nobody have ever point one out to there be no vexatious prosecution would love someone to tell exactly how many british soldier serve time as result of what they do in northern ireland it would not take very long to count they we be disappointed that lords amendment be be oppose by the government operation kenova run by jon boutcher have be laud around the world and be internationally respect as good approach to deal with these issue it have family approval family be buy into the investigation and the outcome they desire it prove the point that if we want to get to the truth we have to investigate time after time whether it be the government or paramilitary organisation they have prove to we that they will not give the truth just because we ask nicely to support the hon member point about the work of jon boutcher and his team in op kenova he will be aware that as result of their rigorous investigative process number of file have now be pass to the public prosecution service include be careful about what say here mr deputy speaker potential prosecution against member of illegal proscribe terrorist organisation yet we have have no outcome to that process from the pps give that this legislation be come down the road one wonder why there do not appear to be sufficient progress be make in follow through on the work of jon boutcher team and move on those potential prosecution the right hon member be absolutely right the family involve we do have to be careful in those investigation be largely very happy about the way in which jon boutcher team have deal with they but of course some people lot of people do not want the truth to get out people in the british government people in paramilitary organisation and some people who be in both of those thing at the same time they do not want the truth to come out because they be very worried that the glorify version of their history actually turn out to be dirty little war stephen mcconomy be year old when he be shoot in the back of the head at very close range by british soldier fire plastic bullet in derry in his brother emmet who have be fight for justice ever since say that the real winner of this legislation be the perpetrator of violence and he be absolutely right some of the file in stephen case will not be open until almost year after stephen murder james miller whose grandfather david miller be kill by the ira horrific bomb in claudy in say describe it as the family have sore and that sore be there all the time it open and we just want that sore to heal james go on they be just close the whole process down for reason lot of stuff may come out that will make the government look bad that be what this be about have be deal with this for year although we work tirelessly on this lot of people do in political party in northern ireland have always believe that the dark force within the state will do all they can to prevent the full truth of what happen from come out some people say that they oppose the bill because it create moral equivalence between the british army and paramilitary organisation that be not why oppose it oppose it because it benefit murderer whether or not they be wear uniform that be fairly simple principle to stand by what we be talk about here be much more important than have be mention we be talk about how we can build future together reconcile future for our people some of my colleague here want that to be within the united kingdom want it to be within new united ireland but know that to get to that place we can not keep glorify the ugliness and horribleness of the past whatever the future bring we still have to come together as community but the bill give cover to those who be put ulster volunteer force flag up lamppost or sing up the ra in pub appeal to anybody who think that that be good way to bring society back together again to talk to some of the victim speak to regularly many of whom know very well all those thing hurt they although the rest of we have be allow to move on and build life as result of the peace process they be still stuck and not because they want to be they be more future focused than anybody have ever meet because they do not want their grandchild to stay stuck have to deal with the mess that they have be leave wish that we do not have to be in this chamber be glad that the labour party have commit to repeal the bill once it be law but in reality between now and the new labour government lot of people could have little letter that they can bandy about because they will have get away with destroy life and family and this british government be give they blank cheque to do it it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for foyle colum eastwood want to speak in favour of the lords amendment particularly amendment relate to immunity town and village in st helens like those in your constituency mr deputy speaker have strong and historic link to the army particularly the cheshire and lancashire regiments have significant active and very supportive armed force community locally and hope that veteran and their family would say in return that have always respect represent and work hard for they but be also honest with they when we talk about the issue in this bill or about northern ireland more generally because there be not legion of veteran be parade before the court there be no vexatious complaint there be no witch hunt it be myth and it be dangerous and disingenuous one want to be honest with the house and with myself too sometimes think we should just draw line under this whole thing that it would be the easy thing to do and then realise how selfish of that be say to myself how dare you be so selfish and ask myself easy for who remind myself that have no authority politically legally and most of all morally to tell anybody to forget to move on and to put it all behind they none of we do what have learn be that while legacy be speak of as something historical it be not just history it be something live by the victim and their family in the present every day have speak before in this house of thing that be do where grow up in south armagh the place love and be so proud to be from kingsmills and the reaveys too much and too many there be the realisation for that even now as christy moore sing in north and south there be no feeling so alone as when the one you hurt be your own we can all point to those case that be beyond tear because of their awfulness their brutality and the sheer human cost but it be those that we do not often recall and that be only remember by those who know and love they that be affect by the bill like martin rowland who be when he be shoot dead on october his body leave on the quarter road in camlough he be remember by local as quiet inoffensive fella his family say at the time he be an enemy to no man no one ever get any answer about why he be murder never mind who kill he although it be widely suspect that there be strong element of collusion between loyalist and crown force martin sister and brother be dead now do that mean he should be forget or that he do not deserve the truth tell my father pat who know martin that intend to mention he and he be pleased but he lifelong republican and former sinn féin councillor say there be also udr man from bessbrook shoot dead that morning it would be disrespectful to mention one neighbour without mention another so ring my friend danny kennedy former minister and deputy leader of the ulster unionist party who tell about george hawthorne year old father of three who have leave the udr the year before and be murder on his way to work as forklift driver at the timber yard in newry his wife sadly deceased work with my mother in the furniture shop in the village they be quiet civil people should that be forget or dismiss do not tell these tale together to be self righteous or to tick the dread what aboutery box tell they to illustrate that this stuff be complicated it be personal and it still affect we all because it happen to all of we or to people we know and people we love when take my kid to south armagh now from st helens they take great joy in wind up their uncle and their granda as we travel from the airport in belfast by cheer when they see union flag fly in some of my hon friend constituency you do not have to look very hard at this time of year there be constant noise all the way down the motorway they say look dad there our flag they welcome we home because kid be great when we pop in for cupán tae cup of tea in mccooey in newry or see my friend michael in whitecross the conversation often turn to majella and what great girl she be they talk about she as if she be here today play out the front happy and without care in the world like my two but she be year old when she be shoot by soldier of the parachute regiment in in the government apologise for her unjustifiable killing that be welcome but what be it worth if this bill become law and how can there be any justice or peace for her family when the file relate to her death have be close until the family like almost every family survivor and victim group oppose the bill that speak more about it than ever could when be cub do my level work the late shift do the taxi radio in camlough one night after we finish and one of the aul timer one of the driver have late drink in the lough inn he start to talk about when the village have high wall and gate around the pub because it have be blow up so often and about all the various altercation and disturbance about the policeman and the soldier about the gaelic athletic association member and the local who have be shoot or kill and about raymond mccreesh and the hunger strike as little more than schoolboy at the time and as richard moore from derry say on the telly recently think he be talk about film or that it be like cowboy and indians say to he it must have be dead exciting he gently put his glass down look dead in the eye and say you lucky you be about it be as simple as that be lucky that be not about then but be about now and we be about now we owe it to the people who be about then to ensure that they get to remember their love one and find out the truth about what happen to they and have the justice and the peace that they deserve and that we in this place of all place should demand the secretary of state say that immunity will be block if there be an ongoing process of course in all likelihood the only trial that will actually take place that be in process at the minute and could take place be those against member or former member of the security service no ira allege terrorist be about to face trial or be up for trial and at present it be unlikely that they will be therefore government members who think that by support the bill they be support the security personnel and protect they from prosecution be wildly mistaken some republicans will not let this issue go there have be couple of comment tonight from member on both the front bench and the back benches suggest that no vexatious case be ongoing actually vindictive and vexatious case be ongoing and want to put one before the house tonight colum marks be lawfully shoot dead by an ruc officer in an action justify by the police the army and those involve because he be about to murder and maim in downpatrick it be very unfortunate that that be the action that have to be take the officer who take part in that operation have now face three trial he be most recently clear by the director of public prosecutions with the word that this be lawful killing not only in his self defence but in the defence of the state and the people live in downpatrick be that the end of it no there be now go to be another trial another attempt to drag that officer know as officer before the court that be vindictive that officer have long since retire he have another family and be try to live his life yet this continue to hang over he we have certain shameful snake oil salesman of legal practitioner say that he be go to take this person this ruc to court on behalf of the marks family that be vindictive and it be ongoing and those matter do offend can ask the hon gentleman to be very careful in his language the last time that solicitor be name in this house we end up in very bad and dangerous place would just ask he to be very careful about his language because we can never go back to those day and people in this house should not be give licence for that thank the hon member for that but he should be very clear that do not actually mention solicitor say legal practitioner because they be not solicitor he want to draw that out as he have do by his comment but he will now see that it be someone very specific people will be able to look up the website of that person who make snake oil sale in this case in that particular way and it be wrong because such person should recognise the outcome of the justice process in the republic of ireland there be no legacy equivalent in the republic of ireland there be no equivalent for the right to access historical legal paper there be no equivalent in the republic of ireland for ombudsman inquiry into garda siochana activity in the republic of ireland there be request by this state for warrant for extradition to bring known terrorist back over the border to face prosecution in our court but only eight of those warrant be ever pursue and deliver on more importantly in the republic of ireland the possession of weapon in northern ireland be not regard as criminal offence and be not regard as terrorist offence the possession of weapon in northern ireland accord to the republic of ireland be political offence and people can not face prosecution for political offence think member can see some of the problem the idea that we have view from another state that all that be happen here should be drag to court somewhere else by we on some sort of high moral ground be absolutely shameful the republic of ireland have threaten his majesty government to take they to court on this issue and they should have good hard long look at themselves because if this issue of legacy be go to be resolve it will have to be resolve by both the north and the south as well as by the united kingdom government properly look at this issue and resolve it would go so far as to say that the republic of ireland actually have duty to address these issue do member want to know how many murder have cross border element to they of the odd terrorist offence or the almost dead almost have cross border element my hon friend the member for strangford jim shannon mention his own personal circumstance and the case involve his family where the terrorist flee back over the border that be where weapon hoard be store and where the republic of ireland give sanctuary to those people who be involve in almost murder of roman catholics and protestants in northern ireland remember that there be more roman catholics murder by the provisional ira in northern ireland than there be roman catholics who be do to death by any other organisation include the state it be important to remember that the big group of people who get off the hook here be the provisional ira and we should be guard strongly against that want to put on the record the comment of senator michael mcdowell the former justice minister of the republic of ireland once again the senator have make it clear that in the republic of ireland he write this in the irish times the irish government of which be member take the decision that further investigation and prosecution by an garda siochana of such historic offence be no long warrant or justify by reason of the great interest in end the provisional campaign and all other political violence in northern ireland of the irish government he conclude and so as far as this state be concern line be draw across the page of historic provisional ira criminality in northern ireland if member want to look for immunity from justice look no far than or mile from where live which be across the border in the republic of ireland where they grant immunity of course in relation to the government here my hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson make comment about the on the run letter and about the decision by those who support the belfast agreement to let the prisoner out of jail and all of those thing turn justice on its head think we have to recognise that this be not go to be an easy fix but can tell you one thing mr deputy speaker what the government be propose today will not satisfy people on the government back benches and it will not satisfy the victim in northern ireland would appeal to the government to think again will start by put on the record my appreciation for the effort of the government in particular lord caine over the past year in try to improve the bill with the amendment that be table in the house of lords it be however matter of regret this will probably be common theme across the northern ireland party that the bill remain fundamentally flawed and not fit for purpose even at this eleventh hour it be important that we say to the government that be what we hear from most stakeholder in northern ireland that they should withdraw the bill it be not want and it be not go to work and achieve what the government think it will even at this stage urge rethink do not take the bill over the line and end up with situation where we have something that will not deliver for anybody in that regard the bill be not fit for purpose in the sense that it be not compliant with article of the european convention on human right it do not have the support and confidence of stakeholder in northern ireland whether that be the political party it be rare that we be so united but we be on this point the different victim group whose voice be particularly to be listen to or the view of virtually every independent expert such as the northern ireland human rights commission which have statutory role to give its view on such matter they be all deeply concerned about the bill and do not believe it will deliver or that it be legally competent want particularly to focus on immunity as that be one of the core area of debate and on the government amendment which will shortly be oppose the concept of immunity be see as be fundamentally unjust by victim most victim appreciate that they be unlikely to see their day in court and successful prosecution of the culprit who take away their love one but they do not want to have that hope extinguish as long as there be hope people be cling on to that that be the real fear and it be on that pivot that people become particularly emotional that be at the heart of the comment that the government be hear from victim across the political spectrum the concept of immunity be also see as de facto amnesty which have its own implication first it go against emerge caselaw at european level but it also carry certain connotation that will weigh heavy on certain people let frame this for moment from the point of view of some people who have work in the police the army and other security service over the past decade want to start by reflect that the vast majority of people who serve do so with honour and with the intent of uphold the rule of law and protect the entire community there be clear distinction between they and the terrorist in that the former do not set out to do harm but rather to protect the community whereas every day the mission of the terrorist be to do harm that be clear distinction the concept of immunity particularly for those who be base in northern ireland almost reinvent the whole nature of their service they say we do need immunity because we do do anything wrong why be we give this abstract concept where our colleague do wrong they should face justice because that be the rule of law and the justice system be among many other value that they be serve this process turn that entirely on its head and almost put they at the level of the terrorist that say justice should be blind and where there be issue to be follow through whatever legacy mechanism we have in place that should proceed without favour to anyone that bring to wide point about the genesis of the bill and this be fundamental reason why there be this lack of confidence the government can not escape from the rationale set out at the beginning and the need to protect certain element who be clamour for protection against vexatious claim who think be generally more gb base than in northern ireland as such we have the comment from the previous secretary of state the right hon member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis when he be introduce the bill and its pretext of give protection to veteran who have serve in particular in the army again stress that many other veteran do not want that protection be also concerned that the concept of immunity will not work because we may find that few people apply for it whether that be perpetrator seek it or family have the confidence to come forward and bring case to the commission we need to reflect heavily on the concept of immunity it have poison the approach to legacy above and beyond the broad concern around article compliance stress again to the government that even at the eleventh hour they should please rethink this bill there be different way of do it we have not have chance to consider properly the stormont house agreement the northern ireland office do consultation on it many year ago and there be basis for take it forward but the government do handbrake turn back in and look at do thing entirely differently ask please that that process be give chance it hold the confidence not just of the political party but of the vast majority of the victim in northern ireland rise to oppose this legislation in the strong possible term and to speak on behalf of the many innocent victim of terror in northern ireland for whom this bill have cause great distress and anguish as be leave northern ireland this morning the real life story it have already be mention in this place of louie johnston be boom out on the radio louie be the son of police officer murder in my constituency louie be seven year old when his daddy be kill by ira criminal because he wear the uniform of the royal ulster constabulary encourage all member to google louie news article today and see the picture of he walk behind his dad coffin broken child it be one of the most powerful picture of the trouble his dad david johnston along with his ruc colleague john graham be shoot dead while on foot patrol in lurgan when he be tell of his father death he say why would anyone want to kill my daddy he ask today for we to show some empathy and he ask whether we believe it be morally right to take away his avenue to justice it be on those comment that make my remark today it speak volume that not one victim group endorse this legislation it be sad reflection that this government today choose to ignore louie call and the call of the many who represent innocent victim this house trust will forgive for labour the point about the hurt and the last legacy of the trouble on their life they have physical and emotional scar that will never heal and those be make bad when people sound out or imply that it be time to move on and draw line in the sand they feel that be code for forget about the victim and forget about what happen do my hon friend also think that we be talk not just about the legacy of the past and the hurt that that have cause but about the impression leave on young people today when they see that the state will grant immunity to people who have carry out some of the most horrible crime deeming that to be okay in other word someone can commit crime and if the political circumstance or whatever be right there can be no consequence do that not eat at the very moral core of society my right hon friend make such valid point on the impact the bill will have on young people and their outlook on these issue it be unacceptable and do not sit well in our society victim in northern ireland have already suffer and have to endure the fact that because of the belfast agreement they can meet the perpetrator of some of these act walk down the street or in the supermarket they live with the continual flaunting and glorification of terrorism by someone who claim to be the first minister for all and who have say there be no alternative indeed the member for belfast north john finucane member of this house recently show his true colour in that regard as well in the face of all the sickening action the taunting and the re traumatising applaud the fortitude dedication and determination of innocent victim to fight for such basic concept as truth and justice sadly those concept be lose in the bill the other place have seek to make this imperfect bill less imperfect welcome some of the amendment it be of deep regret that the government propose to disagree with lords amendment in relation to immunity the amendment would have remove from the bill provision allow immunity from trouble relate crime which the democratic unionist party and believe the majority of people in northern ireland support in my discussion about the bill with victim group in recent month have hear how immunity be what cause the most grievous hurt why it be because it close the door erode victim access to redress and draw moral or should say immoral equivalence between blood thirsty terrorist and public servant quite frankly it weaken our entire criminal justice system throughout the world find it most remarkable that the government should endorse such move the decision be repugnant not just for its perversion of justice which we in the uk claim to value but for the trauma and hurt that it inflict on innocent victim turn to the motion to disagree with lords amendment every family deserve the ultimate hope of full and fair investigation into the circumstance of love one death such an investigation should be subject to the high standard the amendment would have establish minimum criminal justice standard for review along the line of operation kenova follow express fear of water down investigation the commissioner should be under duty to ensure that an article compliant investigation either have be carry out or will be carry out be that too much to ask it be difficult to come to any conclusion other than that the commissioner for investigation will be able only to comply with obligation impose by the human rights act to the extent dictate by the authority and resource grant to that office holder under the act the restriction of criminal enforcement action be such that even if the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery refer all conduct to the public prosecution service much of that material will be admissible compliance with fundamental right need to be cross cut safeguard in how trouble case be deal with irrespective of whether an investigation be at least partially the granting of immunity to perpetrator its value be diminish the government by erase the other place amendment to the bill simply fail to acknowledge the right of victim in term of the standard of an investigation however that be only one part of the jigsaw for victim it be equally important to have their day in court and the prospect of conviction and custodial sentence to grant some form of closure as it be to have proper investigation the bill fail in those respect the government objection to lords amendment will remove the requirement for kenova standard investigation from the bill the government through their amendment seem to want to provide an assurance irrespective of whether commissioner decide criminal investigation be to take place as part of review that all the circumstance of death include potential offence will be look into be sorry but there would appear to be huge gulf between carry out historical investigation that gather and explore as much information as possible in relation to death or harmful conduct and the government suggestion simply to look into that we oppose the bill because we believe in justice and in hold fast to hope for those who pay the big price for our troubled past the bill will lead not to reconciliation but to great distress distrust and disillusionment among victim that they matter to this government we stand with those victim be pleased to speak in this debate and to put forward the desire of the people of strangford in this place and also my own family interruption sometimes when you be at the end

and murder by the ira no one be ever make accountable there be no justice for louis robinson and his family my hon friend have just highlight number of individual who potentially will never see justice if the bill go through the perpetrator can go out and glorify some of the action they have be involve in unfortunately this be process of rewrite history when think of my cousin kenneth smyth think of daniel mccormick roman catholic they be good friend and both serve in the udr but daniel leave he be murder by the ira no one be ever make accountable stuart montgomery be young boy of year

of the people involve over the period of time those investigation and that quest for justice we do not see it understand the government aim see how almost all the case investigation and money spend appear to be on less than of the murder while the be leave as part of history my party grasp well the rationale behind that the dup have be clear and remain clear that the vilification of our serve soldier udr member and ruc member must stop the rewriting of history to make it acceptable for the ira and uvf to carry out their atrocity must end there be never and will never be an excuse for the slaughter and maiming of anyone who wear uniform the dup be clear on that but we be also clear on the fact that for the family all the family have name and all the family everyone else here have name their loss mean so much it be for that reason that can not accept the government proposal and that my party be unable to accept they either the dup mps and all the mps from northern ireland vote against the bill in the house of commons in the lords our member table amendment that be not select we do so not to be obstructive but to fully honour the commitment we give to the innocent those who seek justice and those whom we have all speak of our heart break when we think of they for this reason we can not vote with the government in their refusal of lords amendment which seek to require that the review carry out by the new body the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery should be thorough of an adequate standard and in line with our international obligation it be hard to see how such prospect could be argue against yet the government be not accept that my party leader have be very clear and reiterate it again only criminal trial can bring murderer to justice every one of we want justice justice for our people justice for all those who have lose their life that be why we strongly oppose an amnesty and have vote against it at every turn lord amendment should be accept by the government without it the bill fail to deliver justice the very justice we yearn for the dup still believe that all innocent victim all innocent victim of the trouble have the right to justice dup members find themselves in situation where we agree that the politicisation of the trouble must end but we can not see that the bill will achieve that in the form it be in therefore with heavy heart we can not stand with the government on the bill ask that those who vote do so understand the reasoning behind our stance we do we oppose the ideal we welcome the end to the victimisation of soldier but that must be do through proper handling which this bill be not this be sweeping legislation that change the definition of justice the very justice that all of we in this house uphold when we swear our oath justice for our people justice for our family the bill prevent family have any hope of justice should investigation cease to be political and begin to be about hard fact alone we oppose what the government be put forward today do it for all the victim have name do it for my constituent and do it because it be the right thing to do be really really disappointed really be be very sore and my people be sore about where we be think the secretary of state grasp some of the pain we have think he do but the bill hurt we deeply and must register that with the leave of the house would like to answer few of the point that have be raise first recognise the passion the emotion and the very personal nature of many of the contribution today include those from the hon member for st helens north conor mcginn for north antrim ian paisley for north down stephen farry for upper bann carla lockhart and for strangford jim shannon as say can never put myself in the shoe of the hon member for strangford and nor would want to the question be raise by his party leader the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson about the choice in the bill between justice and information believe the bill deliver opportunity for both the icrir allow for criminal investigation to take place but it also allow for information to be gather for those family who would be happy with just that one reason for reject the amendment about the kenova style investigation be the fact that it rule out allow for the full remit of review through to criminal investigation which would like to see thank the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson for acknowledge that the bill have be improve on its journey the one thing of which have no doubt be the principled position take by he and by his party on the provision relate to amnesty and immunity that position have be well state and have be constant throughout my political lifetime and before and completely understand it the hon member for foyle colum eastwood talk about stormont house be not quite as sure as he be that the search for consensus on this subject come together in stormont house in fact think that that consensus have elude successive government seem to recall that one political party in northern ireland do not agree with stormont house from the very start namely the ulster unionists and be not entirely sure that all political party on the unionist side do so now there may have be consensus on the principle of the idea but be lead to believe that when it come to try to deliver on the agreement the first and deputy first ministers come to what be then her majesty government and say this be all too difficult to do in stormont please do it in westminster that be an interesting take on the matter give what remember happen at the time yes the ulster unionists have some reservation about the agreement but all the other party support it it be up to the british government along with the irish government to implement it and it be only because the british government go off on their own without the irish government and undermine it by ignore rather than implement it that the bill have end up in this place in my strong view this be where the british government have always want to take thing let say to the hon gentleman with the great respect that he have his particular view of what happen follow stormont house but believe that history say something bit different herein lie the issue for we all it be question for the party opposite and it be question for all member in this place if not the bill then what there be no agreement follow stormont house family have go for year for decade without answer to what happen to their love one and believe that the bill be the right way forward at this point history have be revisit in many different way when it come to how agreement might have work in the past may just point out that new decade new approach which be author by this government through one of the secretary of state predecessor contain specific commitment to implement stormont house as recently as january it be the explicit policy of the government to deliver it it be there in black and white in new decade new approach the hon gentleman be right but that become unworkable and impractical because the political consensus simply be not there when it come to legislation the hon member for foyle ask what would happen if someone lie to the icrir well that person simply would not be grant immunity he would lose that immunity as result of the new offence in the bill can the secretary of state think of any time in history when murderer lie thank the hon gentleman for his concise argument but can also think of no part of northern ireland history when we have manage to reach point at which there be consensus on this issue believe that the icrir will have the ability both to carry out criminal investigation and to conduct review and get information for family and that must be step forward my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois ask about article let make it clear that the government amendment go no far than exist obligation under the human rights act and that specifically they do not alter the material or temporal scope of those obligation as they apply to trouble relate case include those that he mention think answer that in slightly more concise way when he pick it up the hon member for hove peter kyle mention host of thing but believe he misrepresent the bill and number of thing in it what he say about the perjury aspect of the bill be straightforwardly wrong perjury provision exist in the bill anyone provide an account to the icrir when apply for immunity will have to provide an account that be truthful and if they do not they will not get immunity may start to conclude my comment by thank my civil servant for all the work that they have do on the bill especially over the course of the past year would like to think that everybody recognise the huge amount of work that have go on will the secretary of state give way be afraid do not have the time wish to close by reiterate that the government have seek to make realistic assessment of what we can well deliver for family over quarter of century after the belfast good friday agreement and nearly year since the first ceasefire and well over year since the trouble begin recognise that this be challenge for all those involve but be prepared to make this difficult decision to try and help northern ireland to take step forward towards reconciliation this government will give people the accountability acknowledgment and information they require to allow northern ireland to become more reconcile society it be matter for regret though that the labour party would rather see veteran and victim treat the same as terrorist during the bill second reading in may the hon member for hove say have be very clear want to make sure that the right of victim and veteran be equal to the right of terrorist and people who commit crime in the era of the report may vol the secretary of state be quote from response to an intervention from the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith where state categorically in the full extent of the reply that the bill give more right to terrorist than victim that be what the full response say what he read be out of context would also quickly say to the secretary of state that do not mention perjury in my opening speech could he address the issue that do raise in my speech not the one do not think might have strike nerve there today the government will demonstrate that they be commit to get victim veteran be victim as the hon gentleman say the family and survivor answer when labour simply two hour have elapse since the commencement of proceeding on the lords amendment the debate be interrupt programme order this day the deputy speaker put forthwith the question already propose from the chair standing order no that this house disagree with lords amendment question accordingly agree to lords amendment disagree

lord amendment to to to to and agree to government consequential amendment make to lords amendment on point of order mr deputy speaker recently ask the minister for immigration what the cost to the taxpayer be of paint over mural feature cartoon design to welcome lone child refugee at an immigration centre the minister reply say that there be no cost to this answer do not seem to be possible unless overstretched worker be redeploy from far more pressing duty and the minister himself bring the paint in from home can seek your advice on how can get clarity on the accuracy of the minister answer order the hon lady will be fully aware that all member include ministers be responsible for the word that they utter in this chamber the usual channel will have hear what she have have to say if the minister choose to come to the house and make comment or correct statement then that be up to the minister but it be not point of order for the chair environmental protection beg to move that the draft environmental civil sanctions england amendment order which be lay before this house on july be approve with this it will be convenient to consider the follow motion that the draft environmental permitting england and wales amendment england no regulations which be lay before this house on july be approve the purpose of these instrument be to strengthen environmental civil sanction so that our environmental regulator can apply an unlimited penalty to company that break the term of their permit and do damage to the environment we be also make it easy for such penalty to be apply rather than have to resort exclusively to take polluter to court for fine to be apply rightly the government care about the environment as do the public in january we publish our environmental improvement plan which set out an ambitious five year blueprint for action to make our country clean and greener to restore nature and to improve the state of our environment in april we set out our comprehensive integrate plan for clean and plentiful water both plan demonstrate our ambition and the action that we would undertake to have laser like focus on clean up the environment include enable our regulator to enforce the law effectively and efficiently let turn to the enabler that we be debate today first the current provision for variable monetary penalty under the environmental civil sanctions england order be cap at possible penalty be suppose to be an effective deterrent to poor performance unfortunately it seem that some operator may have price in the fact that it can be cheap to pay the current penalty than to fix the problem and tackle the pollution of course people who breach their permit and pollute can be take to court face criminal conviction and be face with an unlimited fine and the prospect of go to prison however we know that such investigation and court case can take year to accomplish such an outcome therefore be clear that we must provide strong deterrent particularly for large operator with significant turnover very much welcome these government measure last week we on the environment food and rural affairs committee have an emergency session with thames water ofwat and the department for environment food and rural affairs we receive strong confirmation that the regulator and the environment agency now have the tooth that they need to hold pollute water company to account with unlimited fine or by stop dividend be pay out do my right hon friend agree that this conservative government be the first government to take clear and strong action and that this be in strong contrast to some of the toxic rubbish that come out especially from the liberal democrats who notice be not in the chamber today they seem to forget that when they have water minister during the coalition they do nothing on this order have two point to make first intervention should be intervention not speech secondly there be lot of chirrup go on even if be the only person in the house who want to hear what the secretary of state and shadow secretary of state have to say then want to be able to hear my hon friend be absolutely right about these measure by vote for they today of course they also need to go through the lords we will give our regulator all the tool that they need and that they have ask for to tackle this situation he be right that it be bit of surprise that the liberal democrats be absent but there we go we will be able to remind people that when parliament be vote for this legislation the liberal democrats be nowhere to be see secondly there be currently no provision under the environmental permitting england and wales regulations for variable monetary penalty the majority of environment agency investigation be conduct under those regulation and at the moment the environment agency be limit in its enforcement option to give warning advice guidance or enforcement undertaking or indeed have to go the whole hog and undertake formal criminal prosecution the secondary legislation that we be debate will introduce variable monetary penalty to the regulation ensure comprehensive clear effective and proportionate deterrent within the environmental civil sanction regime penalty will be base on the degree of environmental harm and culpability as well as the size of the operator they be calibrate to act as proportionate deterrent and punishment and both instrument will require the environmental regulator to update and publish guidance that set out their methodology for determine the penalty level last year anglian water use its storm overflow in southend west at least time which result in diluted sewage water be pump into our water for at least hour which be simply unacceptable will my right hon friend confirm that today measure which welcome will mean that anglian water will face severe penalty if it break the rule again and will she assure everyone in southend and leigh on sea that we will finally have real deterrent against it use those unacceptable practice my hon friend be right by give our regulator the tool that they have ask we for we be take action of course the only reason we know about the storm overflow be the level of monitoring which be pretty much completely absent before the conservative party take power in it be critical that we use our tool effectively to ensure that people who have these permit be do the right thing the uncapped penalty will certainly be deterrent can the secretary of state reassure we that any fine will be use to improve water infrastructure in the local area indeed be plan to explain shortly how the penalty will be use they will go into the new water restoration fund it be my decision that that will be localise to the region of the water company that it apply to ideally as local as possible it certainly will not go back to the water company to fix the problem that it be have understand what the government be try to achieve but as the secretary of state point out the environment agency could go through due process with the court and there be already the sanction of unlimited fine what will she do to protect farmer for instance from unreasonable heavy handed fine by the environment agency particularly as it now have an incentive to fine because it will keep the money for its own project on the farming law relate to water we normally find that people be not try to break the law deliberately so it be about guidance and how we make the fix but we have to act and where necessary in severe or continuous case undertake criminal investigation that will always be decision for the regulator the environment agency in this case that be where an element of judgment can and should be apply but ultimately we have to allow our regulator to use the full force of the power available to it to clean our water and improve our environment what will be do to force the environment agency to do its duty in the low avon north of my constituency flood across the area be affect farmland because the environment agency have refuse to enforce the law and ensure that the blockage at the knapp mill waterworks be remove clearly my hon friend be an assiduous constituency mp in raise this issue during our discussion about how penalty can be apply if he would like to write to with more detail could ask the new chief executive of the environment agency to investigate the matter far and respond to he directly my right hon friend be be generous in give way my constituent almost by historical accident have the privilege of pay two water bill rather than one one to anglian water and another to essex suffolk water for different aspect of their water usage they have see those bill increase considerably in the last couple of year as well as fin water company for get it wrong since she mention the regulator can she please put pressure on ofwat to do everything it can to make sure that those increase be first fully justified and secondly as low as practically possible we be stray somewhat from the purpose of the statutory instrument that we be deal with today but have that same situation whereby anglian water cover sewerage and essex suffolk water cover the supply of water one critical element in the price review process that we have be that ofwat go through mechanism of work through with water company what they be allow to invest in and as consequence what the bill change could be we have situation where bill go up with inflation that have be part of the mechanism so far and there be price review process under way but have listen carefully to what my right hon friend say it have always be the case that ofwat be there to ensure that the investment that be require in our waterway and our sewerage be make to ensure that we get good value for money it be important to note that these si cover what happen when we see water company and other operator have have that ability to invest breach their permit we want to make sure that the penalty be uncap in order to act as an effective deterrent as have mention hon member have ask how some of those penalty will be apply expect that as now the environment agency will use the guideline for environmental offence which be publish by the independent sentencing council to determine the level of all variable monetary penalty think particularly of some of the very small business cover by the environmental permitting regime that will also include number of safeguard to make sure that penalty be proportionate on the subject of penalty one thing probably annoy most of we it certainly annoy many of my constituent be that whatever happen the chief executive seem to get massive dividend when it come to damage and penalty be it possible that those dividend could be retrieve and use for the betterment of customer the water industry in northern ireland be not cover by the uk government it be separate system so with the great respect think the hon gentleman will need to follow that up with the northern ireland executive when they be reform which hope will be soon however will also ask the permanent secretary to write to he in that regard the regulation apply only to england we invite the welsh government to join we in make the regulation but they feel unable to act at the pace at which we have act that be not to say there be not sewage spillage or other environmental breach in wales there be we know that on average there be spillage from welsh storm overflow last year compare with in england the new regulation sit alongside the freedom that we have give ofwat to link water company dividend to environmental performance as have refer to the fine and penalty will be reinveste in local water improvement scheme through our new water restoration fund while the water company will pay the polluter penalty and will have to fix the problem at no cost to the bill payer welcome my right hon friend very timely regulation this thursday be meet the environment agency along with two of my local angling society the royal tunbridge wells angling society and the dorset arms angling club southern water regularly pollute the tributary of the upper medway cause great damage to the natural environment and to those angle society will the fine that be to be levy be available to the angle society to restore the stock of fish in which they have invest which have be destroy by those breach by southern water my right hon friend make an interesting point it be the intention that the penalty will be put into the water restoration fund and use primarily in that local area and certainly not beyond the boundary of the water company involve if that be persistent would expect the environment agency to tackle the situation it may be such severe case that it merit criminal prosecution but what we be do today be enable the environment agency and indeed other regulator to act much more swiftly to apply penalty that be strong deterrent should point out that these new change apply to all industry that operate under the environmental permitting regime so the strengthen deterrent will also apply for example to waste site operator the regulation show that yet again this conservative government be take action to improve our environment commend the regulation to the house the only reason we be here today be that after year the country we love and the quality of life for million of work people be suffer from the tory sewage scandal as direct result of the government action raw human waste be dump across our country for more than million hour result in million sewage dump more than every single day million of water customer our constituent have pay their hard earn money in good faith for their waste water to be treat properly instead they see the place that they care about the place where they have put down root and invest their family shared future be pollute those sewage dump go into the sea where people swim into the canal along which people cycle and walk their dog on the towpath into the river where people fish or canoe on to the beach where our child and grandchild build sandcastle and of course into our leisure and beauty hotspot where hard work local business rely on tourist to come flock in number on october last year ask the government what assessment have be make of the economic impact of beach closure as result of sewage pollution on coastal business the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs the hon member for copeland trudy harrison confirm that her department have not make such an assessment can the secretary tell today whether her department have finally work out the economic impact of sewage discharge on those business yes or no do the hon gentleman agree that there be scaremongere by opposition mp about the level of sewage be discharge and that some of we have outstanding bathing water on our beach because there have already be significant investment it be important to recognise the difference between combined sewer overflow and the alternative to it run out to sea less than be contaminate water be it rush up through people front room nuance and fact do matter in this type of debate but the fact speak for themselves frankly go by the government figure there be such discharge each and every day as we see right across the country include in my own region beach be completely close off to member of the public and that have material impact on the business who rely in good faith on tourist come that be the live experience of people there and we should not decry that either so let we get the balance right and accept that this issue need to be address responsible government would undertake an economic impact assessment to truly understand the impact of the problem but the order itself state that an economic impact assessment have not be produce for this instrument as no or no significant impact on the private voluntary or public sector be foresee that feel to as if the government have their head in the sand as the hon gentleman will know there be great deal of debate at the moment not just about the government spending plan but about those of his majesty official opposition everyone know that prevent any discharge of any kind would involve the investment of hundred of billion of pound as the secretary of state have already make plain the government be commit to spend billion as it be if labour think that we be not do enough how much more money would it spend on this that we be not already commit to give we number will check the voting record later but we present our plan to parliament and member have the choice to vote for or against it that plan would have see sewage discharge end by we believe and the evidence say that that could be do with the money that be currently be derive from dividend that be how it would be fund and that would mean bill payer be protect be disappointed that the government do not support that but we be where we be rise be go to make some progress perhaps he could tell we as it be his plan what the figure be order if the right hon gentleman be excited at this point he be go to get even more animate shortly so he should bear with what we see today be not just the result of government inaction or an industry too focus on short term dividend payout above the long term interest of the country more than that it be about system of regulation that be not just ineffective but clear part of the problem all the failing we see in the sector have build up in plain sight of ofwat as the financial regulator and the environment agency debt pile up dividend pour out sewage be dump water leak lead to supply shortage and at least one water company now on the financial cliff edge these water company have not act under the radar they have do it all in plain sight all allow to get completely out of hand and all sign off we know that ofwat already have the power today to issue unlimited fine to curb dividend and to stop the debt mountain get even high the chair of the environment agency speak out against the previous million cap propose by the government say at an environment food and rural affairs committee hear just few month ago the previous secretary of state suggest that the limit on penalty should increase from to million that be number that believe to be high than should be give to we for penalty that we can impose he go on to say my personal view be in the million to million range that be the chair of the agency that these power be be hand over to for unlimited fine in there lie the truth water down the threat of action and water down the consequence too rather than go far than what be previously announce what we see in practice be the government go backwards now suggest penalty just of between and of the cap previously moot the government know that this be not an answer to the tory sewage scandal and more than that the water company know full well that it be not either they know it be not even business as usual be concern about the very likely consequence that we will see even less money be take in penalty and fine as the regulator move away from use its criminal power to civil power with grubby backroom deal be strike in favour of the water company there be also the risk as we have see in the case of thames water that even where water company be find to have deliberately frustrate and mislead an investigation criminal power to hold individual to account be not use regulator under pressure to demonstrate that this cut price policy be deliver the good match with lack of capacity and political will to undertake criminal investigation could well mean that offender be let off the hook water boss be already give get out of jail free card and now they will not even see the inside of courtroom that be what this will do what safeguard will be in place to ensure that there be full transparency on financial penalty to rule out cut price discount or dodgy deal in backroom give what have come to pass will the secretary of state use this opportunity to give notice to the regulator that the watchdog themselves be now be watch the labour party present bill to the house on april that would have end the tory sewage scandal by that bill propose four crucial measure to reduce sewage discharge while ensure that no further burden be add to household bill first it would have set legal requirement for the monitoring of all sewage outlet and penalty if company fail to monitor secondly it would have introduce automatic fine for sewage dumping thirdly labour plan would have implement legally bind target to reduce dumping by by finally it would have require the secretary of state to publish strategy for the reduction of sewage discharge and importantly regular economic impact assessment that be plan that be labour plan but the tories block it they march through the lobby to make sure it would not get time to be debate in this house do the hon gentleman agree that labour plan let alone not be fully cost would have triple the bill that householder have to pay and would have see sewage back up in people home that be the reality of labour plan they do not want to admit it but that be the reality government members seem to be under the misapprehension that our costing for the manifesto be in line with contract award for personal protective equipment they absolutely be not we be of the opinion the industry say this as do the regulator that our plan be affordable within the envelope of money that be currently be take out for shareholder dividend if shareholder can find billion of our money to go out in dividend they can find the money to fix the system and put right the wrong will the hon gentleman give way will make some progress since we present that bill to the house for debate sewage dump have take place labour plan would have ensure that polluter pay the moment they start dump sewage not month or year after the event with investigation and lawyer need to make ruling as such ask the secretary of state whether her department have consider the potential benefit of introduce automatic fine for sewage dumping do she agree that that would save regulator time and money and do the right thing by bill payer and the environment it be not just the coastline that be suffer from the tory sewage scandal sewage unfortunately be close than many believe our national park lake and river the artery of our nation be be sully by tory sanction sewage dumping this be not just an environmental crisis or an economic one for our coastal business it be about whether family can live decent and fulfil life the hon gentleman describe very long stand problem do he have evidence to suggest that the problem be any less during the year before when the labour party be in office be very proud of labour record of leave the clean air and water since before the industrial revolution what the data say dump by dump outlet by outlet beach by beach lake by lake river by river be that year on year the problem be get bad under the tories not well it have all be sanction by the tories will the hon gentleman give way on that point will make some progress if may this be all about whether family can live decent and fulfil life in the place where we live where we work and where we holiday together where family create memory forge bond and strengthen relationship by enjoy the beauty that our country have to offer it be moment like those that make life worth live in the middle of the tory cost of living crisis household be be hammer from every angle with rocket food price again straight to the door of the secretary of state soar energy bill and crippling mortgage rate when it come to people water bill the public be pay for service that be not be deliver that be be feel across the country include in recent week on the doorstep of uxbridge and south ruislip and selby and ainsty can tell the secretary of state that people be not buy her party excuse they want well britain and that start with treat our country the public and business with the respect they deserve labour could vote against these measure it be true that they do not go far enough that they carry significant risk of actually weaken enforcement and that there be little evidence that we will see the change need however we will not allow the government that excuse if vote do come we will vote for the measure for one reason only to prove that for all the talk of action in the end nothing will change until we get change of government because only labour will end the tory sewage scandal the title of these statutory instrument be environmental protection but they should perhaps properly be name as the continue protection of the over mighty quango of natural england and the environment agency be concerned to see that no additional power or extension of their power be give without their also be fundamentally reform together with modern fit for purpose water regulation structure and have make that case before in this place understand that the purpose of these regulation be to change the balance of cost and fine for water base pollution so that the natural market driver will make it less expensive to comply with investing in upgrade infrastructure rather than to pay the cost of pollution if water company get an eye watering attention grab fine the investor and manager will be press to take action understand that the intention be that no consumer will pay either by increase charge or decrease investment furthermore understand that arrangement will be make to keep the value of fine for investment in the particular region affect know that the secretary of state and the minister the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my hon friend the member for taunton deane rebecca pow be personally deeply committed to this issue they have lead the way in this house with groundbreake legislation and action however it have be my experience of ofwat natural england and the environment agency that good intention may not translate into effective delivery and would like to expand on that tackle sewage have be one of my primary piece of work as the member for dover and deal it be an issue care about very deeply because repeat sewage flooding into people home be incredibly damaging and devastating for those affect they find themselves constantly on alert for flood warning with carpet and possession damage or destroy and back garden water by thing other than rain while insurance premium soar and house be difficult to sell that be why repeat sewage flooding be subject to specific regulatory intervention one of my early challenge have be to address decade long sewage flooding in the town of deal and in albert road in particular do all the thing that mps normally do meet resident write letter speak in this place meet ministers ask ofwat to use its regulatory enforcement power and meet the chief executive of ofwat to make the case but none of that move the dial why be that because when finally manage to get out of ofwat what be go on it would not use its regulatory power because there be not an agree solution at the heart of the problem be traditional bazalgette system or the combined surface water and sewage approach that we have have in our country for very long time that system apply in one part of deal but not in the rest and it be not physically possible to separate out the combine system within the historic structure of the town even if it be financially viable to do so every party involve follow every sewage issue from the highway authority to council the drainage board and the water company each have different technical report and view and each of they put responsibility for solve it on the other pretty much my whole career have be one of problem solve in one form or another and know bit about water infrastructure and regulation because carry out year long research programme into it before come into this place so decide to do what would do if be not an mp pick up the phone to the chief executive and ask to meet put forward proposal to set up joint taskforce that be chair by the then chief executive ian mcaulay and as the member of parliament southern water agree to fund top expert team lead by doctor nick mills and rob mctaggart to work out what be possible southern water agree to this approach provide could convene the other statutory body to take part with the same degree of commitment to solve this long stand problem and that be what be happen six month work have lead to month work and it be now one of the pathfinder project bring hundred of thousand of pound of new investment to deal more than to date with more committed expenditure and bring in innovation in slow the flow work right across the town of deal work be ongoing on technical engineering solution and environmentally base solution which be the so call nature base solution we be determined to see the programme through in order to tackle long stand flooding and be an early adopter of the elimination of sewage outflow there will be showcase to parliament in the autumn and very much hope that ministers and members who be interested and who be perhaps speak in today debate will come and see how we be approach this what matter to our constituent be what work and what work be technical solution to technical problem that have be my experience on the ground and it be also the expert advice on this issue from the institution of civil engineers it have advise that the water regulatory framework need update that there need to be well testing and assessment of the nature base solution and that nature base solution need to be well incorporate into the planning system for the build environment who have not be in the room and who have not be part of the solution that be either the environment agency or natural england that matter because these new mega fine will be impose by body that have no idea and no role in solve these issue the fine will be impose on water company without require other relevant and necessary party to come to the table and work through proper technical and deliverable solution for the benefit of our community the fine could be impose on water company that have already agree an investment strategy to tackle this issue include the cost to the consumer and agree to by their own regulator ofwat there be clear disconnect in what be be discuss today although one must hope that the agency will act responsibly holistically and sensibly current evidence do not support that natural england first moratorium on house building be impose in june since then ban on new build have spread to more than quarter of england local authority area affect around home across local authority area from cornwall to the tees valley and further few home be expect to be build each year until solution be find that solution will not be find in natural england my hon friend be right to bring up the problem for house building from the nutrient neutrality programme do she agree that the way to solve that problem and reinforce the government welcome effort to prevent pollution lie within the water industry itself and with well treatment of sewage so that we achieve nutrient neutrality without the slightly blunt instrument that natural england have choose to use over the past couple of year thank my right hon friend for those comment because he be absolutely right blunt instrument will not solve the issue that be block house building in our community and we have not see solution from natural england that will bring those solution forward he be correct to comment on the failure of water company to invest which have contribute to this issue in addition to the root cause of agricultural run off in river pollution it be estimate that all exist development residential commercial and the rest of the build environment contribute less than towards the phosphate and nitrate load in our river that mean that occupant of any new home build would make negligible difference to that issue yet it have an enormous cost and impact on the community where those new home be not be build while those much need new home with their negligible impact be block by natural england the environment agency be allow farmer to pollute with high nutrient fertiliser which be themselves source of nutrient pollute problem planning permission continue to be grant for high intensity poultry unit for example result in the absurd situation where developer may be force to buy pig farm and close it down in order to get permission to build home only for the now cash rich farmer to open another new pig farm just down the road while the rich farmer get rich the small and medium sized enterprise developer go bust delegation of sme builder bring their case to downing street this month the large developer redrow have just announce plan to close its office in the southern and thames valley region which be one of the area affect by the nutrient issue the secretary of state be aware that and many other colleague be gravely concerned about the propose approach of keep natural england in control as currently set out in the levelling up and regeneration bill that continue to put immense uncontrolle power over the shape and delivery of our home and community with an unelected unaccountable single purpose quango in natural england as the house may know it be not often that my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green and agree on much but on this he be absolutely right natural england be become an over mighty regulator and it be refer to directly in the regulation that we be debate do my hon friend agree that it should stay in its lane do what it do well and not keep try to expand its empire into area where it be not well qualified to judge be struggle to think of those lane where natural england do thing well an overhaul of these quango be require because they be now make decision about community policy and economic matter without any of the accountability and balance that ministers would have over these issue thank my right hon friend for make those point move on the water restoration fund be where all these mega fine will be put the department press release in april refer to some million in fine that have be collect since they currently go to the treasury but will now go to the new water restoration fund it seem that million in the fund be clearly not enough so we now have an unlimited amount perhaps billion of pound of fine that will be available for as set out in the press release community lead project have vision of an army of green wellie wad through river remove non native and invasive specie pick up net and unblock blockage that would cause barrier to fish natural movement in river as the department press release mention however the government already have proper water regulator although it need reform for the industry it need to be the body drive through the change need to deal with the historical bazalgette style water engineering that change can only happen with big ticket investment and complex technical solution it be not one for the green welly brigade or the orange just stop oil brigade to conclude will the secretary of state look again at the relationship between ofwat the water regulator the environment agency and natural england in relation to this matter have set out case for the reform of those body in relation to today statutory instrument high fine will not in themselves lead to solution the only solution to this issue will be detail complex technical and professional such as those we have pioneer with the deal water action taskforce with southern water and also those set out by the institution of civil engineers and the national infrastructure commission by fail to keep big quango in check be afraid that defra be responsible for substantial fall in house building in this country it be vital that do not happen to investment in our water company too and that we see well regulation effective working and technical solution deliver on the ground and in the waterway for the benefit of our community and constituent and for the natural environment want to make only few brief point first the purpose of these regulation be to strengthen the civil sanction available for environmental regulator in england include natural england and the environment agency in order to provide great deterrent against environmental offence for operator number of colleague on this side of the house have already express concern about the extent to which those regulator be perhaps expand their remit we might call it remit creep for want of well term and not necessarily make the good possible decision as result in that context will the secretary of state look again at the remit of those regulator in particular natural england and enter into conversation perhaps over cup of tea about whether they be go beyond the remit that parliament give they as they be mention in the regulation today take the opportunity to make that request secondly notice from the order paper that both these statutory instrument the house have agree to take they together have not be clear by the joint committee on statutory instruments before anyone get overly excited that be not unknown there be sometimes good reason for why they have to be bring to the house before the jcsi have have an opportunity to scrutinise they but it be slightly unusual when the secretary of state reply to the debate perhaps she could explain to the house why that be the case be sure there be perfectly legitimate reason but it might be helpful for she to get that on the record thirdly can report that have have quite lot of email from my constituent about sewage discharge people in rayleigh and wickford be just as concerned about this issue as anyone else and no one want to see sewage particularly if it be untreated be discharge into our river our estuary or indeed the sea on that suspect we could achieve unanimity across the house however as intimate in my intervention there be already billion of pound go in from the government to try to reduce those discharge as far as be practically possible so that they would occur only in period of the most exceptional rainfall in fairness give the shadow secretary of state the hon member for oldham west and royton jim mcmahon an opportunity to tell the house how much money labour would spend on this issue above and beyond the billion of pound that the government be clearly commit to interruption well he do not answer my question he do no he do not perhaps there be reason why on april the daily express report tory humiliate labour as they force to abstain on their own anti sewage debate under the by line of christian calgie its senior political correspondent the story state the labour party be leave humiliate by the government in the house of commons this afternoon labour mp end up refuse to vote in favour of reduce sewage discharge it claim senior labour mp be overhear say we ve be make to look like twit do not want to introduce partisan element to the no no but have hear the shadow secretary of state speech in which he do that think it be only fair to reply in kind hope that when the secretary of state reply to the debate she will try to get elucidation from he on why labour have this big opposition day debate make big thing of it brief the press tell the country and then abstain there must be some reason if he be too embarrassed to tell the house of commons perhaps she can oblige do my right hon friend also note that as the shadow secretary of state talk about the passion with which labour feel on this subject not one single labour back bench mp be present and that while the government benches be now almost full just two labour back bench mp have appear probably because they want to get warm thank my hon friend for that helpful observation the passion on the labour back benches have almost double in the last minute the whip have obviously be around the tea room and say it look bit thin at the back there boy and girl you well get in there quickly so now want to be accurate count seven labour mp in the chamber be short change anybody no as for the abstention hon member they come in now oh crikey keep go we could be in double figure in minute as for the abstention on april it be admittedly unusual to table an opposition day motion and then abstain on it that be not an everyday thing because the shadow secretary of state say that labour be so passionate about it can only assume that it be passionate abstention labour feel so strongly that it deliberately choose one of its opposition day debate to raise the issue and then passionately abstain in person as someone once famously say if there be really good explanation for that look forward to hear it from the opposition in fact will allow order could gently try to connect the hon gentleman speech with the motion before the house in the interest of equity be allow the shadow secretary of state to intervene on perhaps he could connect it he do not want to intervene to explain why labour abstain on its own motion go go go in that case perhaps the secretary of state could help to elucidate because the labour party clearly be incapable of explain its own policy on that point so as not to detain we far conclude my remark be grateful to right hon and hon member for the wide range contribution to the discussion of the regulation that we be bring forward today across the country people want to see an end to pollution and want polluter to pay that be why we be bring forward these proposal my right hon and hon friend be right to ask what have we hear so far from labour frankly his majesty loyal opposition continue to mislead the public again and again at the dispatch box but not the house because the government and back benchers know that they be talk load of the proverbial there be no doubt that beach have be clean than they be under labour we know that through statistic because labour do nothing about it when we come into office if there have be version of labour famous there be no money leave note lie at defra door it would have say you be sue by europe because sewage be be discharge and we have do nothing about it that be what labour do the labour government know what be happen and they do nothing to stop it for the avoidance of doubt water policy be devolve if labour have credible plan it would use it in wales but it do not and we be see on average more sewage discharge there than in england be also concerned that the opposition continue to accuse our civil servant of bad behaviour encourage the hon member for oldham west and royton jim mcmahon to stop the practice of blame civil servant go on about grubby backroom deal and suggest that our regulator would try to do that be disgrace will apologise on his behalf to our civil servant and regulator do not accuse our civil servant of grubby backroom deal that is behaviour associate with the opposition the government vote for labour motion on april it be labour who run away embarrassed and expose because we be already do what labour be put forward it be already in legislation and under way labour seem to have forget that water policy have be devolve to the labour government in wales an element be clueless and an element be accuse civil servant of potentially do grubby backroom deal the government will continue to clean up the mess that labour leave behind let be clear we be not here to be apologist for water company they need to clean up their act and cover the cost it be up to water company to make sure that they direct any profit they make from billpayer hard earn money into improvement these regulation be what our regulator ask for that be why we be back our regulator to help restore the environment commend these regulation to the house question put and agree to resolve

gavin robinson paul girvan the house divide ayes noes question accordingly agree to petition hull york dental school the select committee on health and social care declare in its report publish last friday july nhs dentistry be face crisis of access and that will not come as news to the constituent of hull west and hessle the national audit office rank east riding of yorkshire as have the third low count of dentist per head of population in the entire country we desperately require more nhs dentist in the region and this petition call for the establishment of new dental school to help meet that need the petition state the petition of resident of the united kingdom declare that the recent survey by the british dental association show the dental workforce have be reduce to level not see since far that unmet need for dentistry be at record high at in of adult population in far that the proportion of dentist now report their intention to reduce or far reduce the amount of nhs work they undertake in stand at far that the national audit office rank the east riding of yorkshire as have the third low count of dentist per head of population in the country at per in its late report far that hull have historically high level of tooth decay in child far that there be direct correlation between increase rate of tooth extraction and the risk of mouth cancer far that there be an overwhelming need for more dentist in the region far that this need can be meet by train more dentist locally further note hull york medical school open in and now see over newly qualified doctor year enter the profession the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government take into account the concern of the petitioner and take immediate action to facilitate the creation of hull york dental school and the petitioner remain etc petition bank branch everyone deserve to be able to manage their own money which be why bank have long be focal point within local community however branch closure most recently the bank of scotland branch in cupar and falkland and the barclays branch in st andrews have leave massive hole and create incredible stress for people who for whatever reason can not rely on online banking this be particularly true in rural area present this petition on behalf of local resident who recently sign it and on behalf of the many other who have speak to on the doorstep about their concern the petitioner therefore request the house of commons urge the government to ensure that the bank closure in north east fife be reverse and all local bank branch be protect follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the constituency of north east fife declare that bank branch particularly those in cupar falkland and st andrews be the heart of their community and be rely upon by local community those who need access to cash and those without internet banking the petitioner therefore request the house of commons urge the government to ensure that the bank closure in north east fife be reverse and all local bank branch be protect transport infrastructure warrington motion make and question propose that this house do now wood be grateful to have the opportunity to discuss warrington transport infrastructure one of my main motivation for do so be that during the year have live in warrington the traffic jam have get bad principally on the vital route cross the manchester ship canal which run through the heart of my constituency few week back during business question raise with the leader of the house the difficulty that my constituent have be experience when try to cross the canal owe to the age and upkeep of the swing bridge that carry the traffic there be three main swing bridge in warrington one on the one on the and one on the all of which have be in operation for almost year since the manchester ship canal open back in the manchester ship canal act be pass when queen victoria be on the throne and it do not anticipate the number of vehicle cross on these route the volume of traffic that the bridge carry today make they critical route for resident and commuter travel through warrington however their age make they susceptible to ever more frequent breakdown and fault they be sometimes leave stick open for hour at time during period of exceptionally hot or cold weather when the metal expand or contract during peak hour the standard opening of bridge to allow boat to pass along the canal can result in huge congestion which take up to minute to return to normal and it be not just one bridge opening all three bridge open as boat pass from liverpool to manchester naturally this be only make bad when the bridge do not function as they should the deteriorate condition of the bridge mean that they require essential and thorough maintenance the stick point pardon the pun be not who be responsible for the repair work which be accept to be peel ports the owner of the manchester ship canal but who pay for the wide mitigation when the bridge be closed peel ports estimate that the repair work for each bridge will cost around million and take up to nine month to complete during which the bridge undergo maintenance will be close to traffic and leave permanently swing open this will result in mile diversion to use one of the adjacent bridge when each bridge be undergo maintenance as such the council have seek appropriate mitigation cost from peel particularly to cover the cost of provide home to school transport as the hundred of pupil who currently walk or cycle to nearby school would become eligible for free transport to be provide the difficultly have arise from peel refusal to acknowledge any responsibility to provide that bus service or school transport cost which encompass the majority of the mitigation seek by the council that have leave the situation at an impasse with the schedule maintenance work to the london road bridge due to have commence in april have now be put on hold with no date agree for the work to take place unfortunately the swing bridge be not the only vital transport route where peel be involve in warrington the warburton toll bridge over the manchester ship canal which cross the warrington and trafford council boundary be also in need of upgrade work to fund that peel have propose raise the toll from per crossing price set in to for every journey for someone travel to work each day as many people do over the bridge that would mean have to pay about extra per year simply to get to and from work it be simply not acceptable that the burden should be place on the motorist for whom this route be an essential part of their daily life and make that point last november at the public inquiry on the plan several of my constituent have also get in touch to raise their concern about the introduction of propose auto pay system at the warburton bridge because of their experience of have be catch at similar crossing such as the mersey gateway bridge between runcorn and widnes in the first quarter of this year million crossing over the mersey gateway bridge be record in that period penalty be issue mean that there be one fine for every crossing make that be an incredibly high rate and do not want to see similar situation develop at the warburton toll bridge the overarching point hope the minister have gather from that be that my constituent who depend on these vital canal crossing for work school and general travel be currently leave at the mercy of private company that just do not appear to grasp the reality of the situation own major waterway such as the manchester ship canal bring great responsibility to the people who live and work on either side peel should therefore be do everything possible to minimise disruption to the daily life of my constituent yet there have be failure to acknowledge the enormous impact that the closure of the swing bridge will have on the warrington south community in particular couple with an unacceptable and for many unaffordable toll increase on vital crossing in and out of warrington these issue have call into question the validity of these vital canal crossing be own and operate by private company and it be time that we look at whether that should be change another issue would like to raise with the minister concern the propose warrington western link bypass to connect the chester road with the sankey way in great sankey that scheme have be put forward as means to significantly reduce congestion in the town centre by provide an alternative route to cross the manchester ship canal mean that car would not have to use the swing bridge or go to the bridgefoot gyratory in april the department for transport confirm that the scheme have be successful in secure programme entry into the large local major scheme programme and warrington borough council subsequently approve the proposal cost at million of which million would be fund by the government with the borough council provide the remain million since then the project cost of the scheme have balloon into the region of million leave shortfall of some million on today figure that have leave the proposal for the western link in serious jeopardy my great fear be the knock on effect that this uncertainty have for the infrastructure in the council proposal in its local plan to build thousand of new home and logistic warehouse on green belt in south warrington as of now no one can say for certain whether the western link will become reality that be deeply concern when we be talk about proposal that will see many more car on the road increase congestion and worsen air quality if sufficient road infrastructure be not there to support that despite those issue one area where can speak positively be warrington bus network thank to various pot of funding from this government warrington brough council have finally be able to benefit from significant increase in bus funding the large million come from the department for transport that will enable warrington own buses municipal bus company to replace its entire fleet with over new zero emission electric bus the minister will recall that couple of month ago in this chamber ask he to join in call on warrington borough council to get on with order our new bus be pleased to update the minister as finally month since receive the zero emission bus regional area funding an order have be place the funding have finally be put to use and new bus fleet will be roll out from disappointingly it be not necessarily be make in this country but at least we be go to see new bus on the street of warrington people read the council press release would be forgive for believe that the entire project have be fund by warrington borough council the bus need home and be incredibly grateful that the minister join in warrington back in february to see the progress on the new bus depot that be be build on dallam lane again be pleased to update he that that have be complete the project receive million from the town deal but no mention of that be make by warrington borough council in its press release on top of the new fleet and depot the government have be able to make improvement to route and service across warrington thank to the million we have receive from the department for transport bus back well fund because of that the council have be able to proceed with its bus service improvement plan cap fare at for adult and for young people age five to until again people would be forgive for think that be all down to funding provide by warrington labour council when in reality the funding commitment have come from this conservative government as say the government have put approximately million into warrington bus network which can safely say be one of the large investment of its kind in the north of england it be great example of what can be achieve when local and national government work together to deliver for people in the north however come full circle the fundamental weakness in all these initiative in warrington be the failure to invest in the road infrastructure to carry the bus in conclusion would like to ask the minister couple of question on point have raise in the debate on the issue surround the operation and maintenance of the manchester ship canal swing bridge crossing will the government give any consideration to review the original legislation the manchester ship canal act which seem to be fundamentally out of date be it not time that car be give priority and there be focus on ensure that the bridge stay open at peak time will the minister and his department take step to ensure that private owner such as peel be play their part to minimise disruption and operate the crossing for the benefit of the people who depend on they do the minister know if there be any support package available to help with the cost of mitigation when major infrastructure work take place such as the swing bridge replacement currently propose with regard to the western link know his department have receive correspondence recently from warrington borough council request that the government increase their funding contribution to help make up the shortfall cause by the increase cost of the scheme will the minister outline the position of his department on the funding shortfall will he reaffirm that the department for transport will be commit to the funding originally approve towards the cost of the scheme when it go ahead do he agree that while the scheme remain in limbo it be frankly inappropriate for the borough council to be propose large housing and logistic development on green belt if it can not commit to fund the infrastructure there to support those project finally will he reassure that he will look carefully at any recommendation from the independent inspector to increase crossing toll for the warburton bridge local resident be already impact by high inflationary pressure on the cost of living they do not need furth of toll simply to cross the manchester ship canal warrington be designate new town in since then the population have more than double yet our transport infrastructure simply have not keep pace with the increase demand an additional high level crossing which be plan near to the exist cantilever bridge have never materialise between stockton heath and grappenhall despite land be reserve for it because of that private company be attempt to play catch up with essential repair work to vital crossing at the expense of resident and commuter who depend on they and the local authority be press ahead with half bake local plan that could only severely worsen transport issue in warrington the government have do great deal for warrington resident in the past few year and be particularly grateful to the department for transport and the minister for the investment that have be make in warrington bus thank he again for come to the dispatch box to respond to one of my adjournment debate and look forward to hear he address some of the concern that have raise today it be always delight to respond to my hon friend the member for warrington south andy carter he be persistent campaigner on behalf of the people of warrington south and the broad local community congratulate he on again secure an adjournment debate and on speak so passionately about the issue that affect his constituent in warrington without doubt he be an absolute local champion for the area it be great to hear he acknowledge the championing of his community by my department and the huge amount of investment that we have make might even put he in touch with my communication team at the department for transport to see whether he can give we some pointer on how we can ensure that this conservative government get the credit for the ten of million of pound of investment that have be plough into his area be particularly grateful for the opportunity to discuss transport in warrington today this government understand the importance of transport to people and business as it power local economy across our country our levelling up white paper publish last year set out our plan to transform the uk by spread opportunity and prosperity across the country and bring leave behind community up to the level of more prosperous place transport be vital to achieve that end it improve access to job and service change business location decision and help to restore pride across our country that be why we be invest in both local transport and major infrastructure project to improve connection across our country will touch on some of the investment in warrington that my hon friend mention this be one of the large investment in any town by this conservative government we have commit more than million in the bus service improvement plan to supercharge the local bus network million in zero emission bus regional area funding to transition local operator warrington own buses entire bus fleet to zero emission be delighted to visit the area in february to highlight some of that investment and million to develop the full business case for the warrington western link road scheme overall we have make conditional commitment of up to million to deliver that scheme subject to final approval there have also be an allocation this financial year of million to help warrington support highway maintenance pothole repair and local transport measure an additional be announce this year at the spring budget for pothole repair warrington have benefit more broadly from many different transport scheme include the big plan that we have to transform rail across the north in november we commit in our integrate rail plan to billion programme that will transform rail service across the north and the midland it be the single big rail investment ever make by uk government this include northern powerhouse rail network run from liverpool to york and newcastle via warrington commitment to new high speed line between warrington manchester and yorkshire reinstatement of the warrington bank quay station as low level station and upgrade and electrify exist line between warrington and liverpool warrington bank quay station in my hon friend constituency will also get direct benefit from the npr connection there include well regional service and well service into london in addition development opportunity in warrington include site close to warrington bank quay station will be an attractive draw for local investment when combine with the connectivity improvement that we be plan that build on an over billion investment complete in that upgrade and electrify many railway line across the north west let turn to some of my hon friend specific point particularly in relation to the manchester ship canal and importantly the three swing bridge that serve the town centre warrington be nexus of road rail and waterway historic waterway and crossing that echo the glorious industrial heritage of the region which we both hail from by its nature it be an intricate network and understand just how disruptive it can be to community when key artery be out of action the three bridge in question own and operate by peel ports have serve the town for over year and as my hon friend state be clearly in need of complete refurbishment recognise the dual purpose that the bridge serve access for the local community and access along the manchester ship canal for shipping there will inevitably and regrettably be disruption that need to be plan for and manage be grateful to my hon friend for his effort to date on the matter of manage the impact of that disruption to the local highway network it be for the local highway authority warrington borough council to assess the need of the local community include resident visitor and business and to weigh up the option recognise that the bridge be outwith the local authority direct control it be therefore vital that the local authority and peel ports work together as closely as possible to manage any disruption cause by the work understand that discussion between the local authority and peel be ongoing and hope that reasonable solution can be find so that the whole local community can benefit hope that they hear my hon friend plea today know that he will continue to campaign hard for something that both peel and his local authority can come together on in order to help local authority to plan effectively for manage their road and to improve asset management the government have move to three year funding settlement for local highway maintenance amount to approximately million of capital funding per year that funding cover we all the way through to and be some of the money that hope the local authority might be able to use locally warrington borough council be receive around million of it this year on top of the in the budget it will be for warrington to determine which aspect of its highway maintenance programme it wish to prioritise the council may want to look at how it can use some of its money potentially work with peel ports to look at the issue that my hon friend raise turn to the support for local bus service warrington be rightly proud of its bus network and the government recognise the importance of local bus network to ensure that community can stay fully connected we have provide over billion across the country since the pandemic to help mitigate the impact of the coronavirus most recently through the bus recovery grant which warrington along with most local transport authority benefit from in may we announce long term approach to support and improve bus service with an additional million to support service right up until april that will be make up of two element million provide to local transport authority include warrington through bus service improvement plan plus mechanism and million provide to operator through the bus service operator grant plus give that warrington operate its own bus that bsog will come directly to it the flexibility for warrington around the million of bsip funding that it receive have think be welcome by all must be clear that responsibility for the maintenance and care of bridge and road particularly in case such as this where road cross waterway and have commercial implication and implication for local business and commuter must fall to local party to manage commend my hon friend on his effort to resolve this locally will say little more on that at the end on the warburton toll bridge crossing be very much aware of the issue that he mention the inspector report into the propose rixton and warburton toll increase be receive by the department for transport on july the report and all the documentation pertain to the proposal will be assess with decision issue in due course assure my hon friend in answer to his question that the inspector will look very carefully at its implication for local people as my hon friend know warrington have be progress the warrington western link road scheme for potential government funding as large local major scheme this scheme would provide new km link road in west warrington include new high level bridge over the manchester ship canal which people have be campaign for as my hon friend say for very long time it would also look at other bridge include over the mersey to well connect north and south warrington and help to reduce the reliance on the swing bridge that be the focus of his speech in the government make conditional commitment of up to million towards delivery of the scheme bring it into the large local major programme subject of course to an outline business case that approval would come after the approval by my department of full business case for the scheme at the time as my hon friend say the total scheme cost be estimate at million with the council contribute million and the department for transport million as have already mention million have already be provide directly by the department towards the development of that final business case the council have inform my official of the challenge that the scheme now face from cost increase as result of inflation understand that the potential funding gap have now reach about million be of course sympathetic to the challenge that local authority face understand that my official have ask the council for information from recent business case development for the scheme to well understand the position and whether the strategic case for the scheme have be strengthen include perhaps by some of the issue my hon friend raise in relation to the swing bridge however need to be clear that my department policy for any scheme on the mrn llm programme major road network and large local major be that the potential funding contribution be cap at the point of the outline business case however we be continually willing to look at that and look forward to further conversation between my department and the council to see whether the business case can be strengthen in answer to my hon friend question about the manchester ship canal we be always willing to look at historical issue and legislation urge he to write to about it in detail so that can give he properly detailed response give that it be piece of victorian legislation it would need to be look at it in depth due to the intricacy that it will involve and the many other piece of legislation that will interact with it across government in closing thank my hon friend again for secure this debate hope that have reassure he and the house of the government commitment to transport infrastructure in warrington not in word but in the ten of million of pound that have already be provide the more than million that have already be ringfence for the western link road and the huge investment in the rail network look forward to work with he on future plan and development for warrington and be sure that both peel ports and the local authority have hear his voice strongly call for they to come together and find solution for his constituent and for warrington congratulate he as ever on speak up on behalf of warrington in this house question put and agree to house adjourn
