seven standing order no before we begin would like to take moment to remember lord tebbit the former right hon member for chingford who die yesterday he be one of the giant of the thatcher era before his political career be cut short by the attack on the grand hotel in brighton the thought of the whole house be with his family and friend oral answers to questions justice the secretary of state be ask crown court backlog what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog what step her department be take to reduce the crown court backlog the government inherit record and rise court backlog we be invest more than the conservatives ever do and fund record allocation of crown court sit day this year which be more than during the last government but we must reform too sir brian leveson will soon present his recommendation for deliver once in generation reform and swifter justice for victim in essex of case be stop after defendant have be charge because victim be drop out and withdraw their support with some waiting year for their case to get through the court be it any wonder that they give up on justice do the secretary of state agree that we need radical action now to stop the backlog from get any big in place like my constituency of harlow my hon friend be absolutely right victim on many occasion feel retraumatise by the criminal justice system because of the long delay defendant know that case be take too long to be hear too many of they think that they can game the system and that if they wait long enough victim will drop out that be why we be determined to deliver swifter justice for victim it be why we have deliver record number of sit day in the crown court this year and it be why we will do once in generation reform of our court after sir brian publish his review thank to the massive court delay inherit from the conservatives as the secretary of state say resident in dartford continue to face huge delay in get case involve they to court what assurance can she give that the delay will reduce and that for my constituent it will not continue to be case of justice delay be justice deny my hon friend be absolutely right that the old adage justice delay be justice deny have come true we know that we need bold reform we have to get the backlog down and we have to deal with the rise and record demand come into the system as well that be why we have make record allocation of crown court sitting day but we also need bold once in generation reform his constituent and the country deserve nothing less the people of newcastle under lyme want thug and criminal to be hold to account and to feel the full force of the law and victim of crime to get the justice they deserve in the west midland my home region and the lord chancellor the crown court backlog have increase by over case since it be clear that we need an overhaul of the system and to speed up justice will the lord chancellor tell we two thing when do she expect the leveson report to be publish and what may it mean for the future of jury trial the publication of sir brian leveson review be due very soon my hon friend will understand why can not give any the exact date but once sir brian have publish his finding the government will consider they in due course and we will come to the house first with our full response jury trial will remain cornerstone of our justice system in the most serious case but we have to recognise that they take five time long than case hear in magistrate court and magistrate court already hear of all criminal trial with victim wait so long for their day in court we must ask whether there be case be hear by jury today that need not be hear by jury in future the rise in the crown court backlog in be additional case that be extra case on the backlog every month the figure for march show an additional rise over three month of that be additional case on the backlog every month not only be the position get bad under the lord chancellor leadership but the rate at which it be get bad be increase can she explain to the house why the rate be get bad and why when in november the lady chief justice offer additional sitting day she do not accept every single one of those be rather surprised by that question from the hon gentleman because he be normally across the detail let tell he two point of detail that be miss from his question first he know that the demand come into the system be rise we have record number of case come into the system which be good thing because it mean that victim be seek justice but the system have not be able to cope with that demand secondly he should know that there be difference between judicial capacity which be what the lady chief justice have speak about and system capacity unless he and the conservatives have suddenly discover system that will print new judge lawyer prosecutor and defence barrister overnight think he will recognise that there come point at which additional money do not buy we the ability to go fast that be what have to reckon with as lord chancellor have set the sit day at because that be the max for the system and that be fully fund we will consider once in generation reform to get to the bottom of this problem and fix it once and for all hannah contact for the first time in august last year after numerous stalk incident online abuse and violent threat from member of her family he be still at large almost year on despite four arrest the court date keep be put back due to the backlog there have be further breach of the bail condition and restraining order issue but we have hear that fourth trial will be delay until at the early what be the lord chancellor able to do to help victim who be already in the system and who continue to be abuse by perpetrator will happily look at the detail of the case that the hon lady raise some of that relate to charge and what the police and other be do but will ensure that she get full response from across government on some of the specific let observe that we make whole range of victim support available to victim as they navigate the criminal justice system and we will continue to do so recommend that she recommend some of those mechanism to her constituent we have make record allocation of funding to the crown court but we recognise that we need to go far as we will after the publication of sir brian leveson report the crown court backlog stand at approximately case annually and rape and sexual assault trial in leicester crown court face delay of up to three year what step be the department take to reduce that backlog and ensure that serious offence be bring to trial more efficiently to prevent further trauma for victim and the miscarriage of justice the hon gentleman be right that the delay in the system and the long wait for trial be cause huge amount of trauma to victim who regularly tell he and other member from across this house that they feel retraumatise by the criminal justice system when they seek justice be not willing to tolerate that which be why have make record funding available recognise right at the outset that the system can not carry on as it have do for all these year we need to ask big question about the sort of case in our system that get jury trial and those that do not this government will pursue once in generation reform of our crown court call the chair of the justice committee last year magistrate court trial and crown court trial have to be cancel because the defendant be not bring to court on time by prisoner escort contractor we expect sir brian report very shortly which will have range of proposal on how to reduce the unprecedented backlog in the crown court do my right hon friend agree that however effective those reform prove to be they will be undermine from the start unless the performance of contractor such as serco improve my hon friend be right that the performance of contractor need to improve he and have discuss that and the issue regularly come up in oral question in relation to the contract for electronic monitoring we monitor those contract regularly we be determined to pursue once in generation reform but my hon friend will know that the whole system need to become more productive and efficient that be why there will be second part to sir brian leveson work which will report later in the year and which will look at productivity and efficiency across the criminal justice system regularly discuss these matter with the criminal justice board as well one of the most important thing we can do as the lord chancellor seem to indicate be reduce the number of case go into the system by reduce reoffende where possible include intergenerational reoffending give that of boy with parent in prison will go on to offend what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that the child of prisoner be properly identify and support so that they do not become the next generation of people in prison the right hon gentleman raise really important point and be grateful to he for do so focus on the child of prisoner be manifesto commitment of our party because exactly as he say there be cycle there that society need to break particularly for the child of male prisoner and especially their son we be lead work on join up information sharing across government to make sure that those child be identify properly support and able to break the cycle of offend in their family we must do so in way that do not stigmatise those child and push they away from those who want to help they sensitivity and delicacy be require but the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to recognise the problem which we be work on with colleague in other bit of government call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal prime minister william gladstone be right when he say justice delay be justice deny he would look on the inheritance that this government receive from the conservative government as matter for great shame while creative solution be require to tackle the backlog the jury trial which we hear may be at risk for some be critical safeguard on state power and be key to liberal and free society ahead of the leveson report which be come out very soon can the government tell we how they will increase the overall capacity of the court system to dispense justice as oppose to potentially undermine justice altogether thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for that question but would challenge he on two point do not think we be undermine justice in this country when he himself recognise that justice delay be justice deny we be try to properly think through what be good system for we to proceed with in this country as he know of all criminal case already go to the magistrate court that be why we will pursue the reform that we have set out private contractor justice services what step she be take to ensure that private contractor deliver justice service be hold to account we inherit set of contract from the previous government some of which be not perform as we would like particularly in the area of maintenance and electronic tagging the prisons minister in the other place be grip this situation and drive progress with regular meeting to review performance in serco be fin million for overcharge the government for electronic tagging but it be still award the new million contract in give the secretary of state comment in march that the performance of serco be not good enough can the minister explain what private company actually need to do for the government to see it as unfit to hold contract such as this one while the performance of serco have be unacceptable as the hon gentleman say we have make progress and performance be improve we have impose fine for poor performance and will not hesitate to employ further contractual remedy or other measure should they be require but this be contract that we inherit from the conservative party and we be do our good to make it work thank the minister for that response and this government be do their good to make thing work but channel have reveal that the contract with serco be fundamentally fail in the answer to my write question in june serco performance be still deem to be unacceptable so where be we with bring serco around to perform properly if it do not do so will the government consider cancel that contract and bring those service back in house all option be always under review but as have say performance under that contract be improve the prisons minister in the other place be grip this issue and we will get to where we need to get to legal aid rural areas what step she be take to help provide access to legal aid to people in rural area people must be able to access legal aid regardless of where in the country they live and this government have make substantial new investment on the civil side in housing and immigration we have announce uplift worth million in respect of criminal law criminal legal aid solicitor will receive an additional million year the legal aid agency work hard to ensure that the supply of and access to legal aid be secure across the whole of england and wales from the lack of rural crime strategy to reduce access to legal aid our rural community be be leave behind in harpenden one farm alone have report fly tipping incident in five year with the injustice that the most recent incident be cost the farmer around proper legal support for victim of rural crime could make world of difference so how be the government ensure fair access for our rural community include face to face legal aid support the hon lady be absolutely right that we need to ensure access to legal aid for those who live in rural area the legal aid agency be satisfied that legal aid service across all category be adequate in her constituency of harpenden and berkhamsted digital technology be transform access to justice through remote consultation and government fund website such as advicenow encourage her constituent to access legal aid through those mean as well as through local provider prison officer term and conditions of service what progress she have make on review term and condition of service for prison officer pay tribute to the essential work that our prison officer do day in day out this year pay award deliver another real term pay rise for our frontline prison staff we be committed to effective training and development of exist staff as deliver through the enable programme alongside the provision of extensive wellbeing service be in correspondence with the minister of state for prisons probation and reducing reoffende last october but he sit in the other place in january be advise by the minister in this place that the secretary of state be await advice about the range of term and condition issue for prison officer be also advise later in the spring again from the dispatch box that it be right that the situation be be keep under review thank the minister for the thoughtful and sincere way in which he have engage with in recent month but give that have be ask about this issue for nine month can he provide an update today on progress with the advice and on exactly what be be review the hon member and have useful meeting short time ago to explore all these issue and can reaffirm that the lord chancellor and the department be fully engage with the prison officers association on this and other issue call the shadow secretary of state there have be spate of attack on prison officer in recent month by islamist terrorist one study even reveal that terrorist inside prison be teach organise criminal how to make bomb it have get so bad that former governor believe that the threat pose to frontline staff by radicalise islamists be now intolerable can the minister tell we what his assessment be of the threat from islamist gang and what on earth he be do about it we be work hard to enhance security and ease crowd in order to curb violence include through new million investment to stop contraband which put our hard work staff at risk assault on staff and the other issue that the right hon gentleman mention be unacceptable that be why we be firmly and securely take action we be mandate the use of protective body armour in the high risk unit and on the long term high security estate which hold some of the most dangerous prisoner we be take action while the previous government fail prison officer morale pension age what recent assessment she have make of the potential impact of lower the pension age of prison officer on prison officer morale prison officer benefit from the civil service pension scheme which offer excellent public sector term low employee contribution and employer contribution but we recognise that pension age be an important issue for prison officer that be why we be fully engage with the union on this issue the last government hike up prison officer pension age to and then walk away from negotiation that be set up to partially reverse that unfair and unrealistic policy this devastate morale which be now bad than ever especially with violence against staff at record high be this government prepare to do what it take and clean up yet another tory prison mess will ministers finally get back around the table with the prison officers association to negotiate fair pension deal for its member my hon friend be absolutely right to point to the fact that this be yet another tory mess that we have inherit as have say we value the work of the poa and we recognise the significant work of prison officer and the strength of feeling on this issue we will continue to engage with the poa and other to try to find the good way forward there be problem in our prison across the united kingdom it be two spectrum problem in that there be an increase in turnover with prison officer leave early while the problem of the pension continue can the minister increase the intensity of discussion with the poa to try to reach more satisfactory outcome to which the department and the prison officer concern be amenable the hon gentleman make fair point we need to make progress on this issue and we be determined to do so violence against women criminal justice system what step she be take to support victim of violence against woman through the criminal justice system we be fund police support service such as independent sexual adviser and domestic abuse adviser we have launch domestic abuse protection order in select area and as recommend by the sentencing review we be explore the possibility of expand the use of domestic abuse specialist court we have ask sir brian leveson to conduct review of our criminal court with the ambition of reduce the time for which victim wait for justice woman from winchester write to say it feel as though every department that should have protect we have instead fail we after year of high risk domestic abuse she go through cid investigation to prove that she need financial separation but the police miss the crown prosecution service investigation deadline and no charge be bring she be now unable to secure child maintenance her abuser remain in financial control which be effectively enable by government system what discussion be the minister have with colleague in the department for work and pensions and his majesty revenue and customs to ensure that perpetrator of domestic abuse can no long use financial system to maintain power and control over their victim the hon member have make the important point that this be not just criminal justice problem to be solve but problem for every single department that be why we have cross government strategy on tackle violence against woman and girl which include economic abuse along with the safeguarding minister regularly meet treasury and dwp colleague in order to get to grip with the problem and we will publish our strategy in the come month welcome all the work that the secretary of state and her team be do in this important area for instance through the women justice board at least of woman in prison and on probation be victim survivor of domestic abuse and in many case their alleged offending be directly link with their experience of that abuse what consideration have the minister give to the introduction of an effective defence for domestic abuse victim who use force against their abuser and for those who be coerce into offending know that my hon friend care deeply about this issue she will be aware of the work that the women justice board be do with the department some of the review by david gauke include specifically the sentencing review and baroness casey recent rapid review of groom gang all that work be connect with defence for victim we be actively consider this matter and will happily work with my hon friend and the centre for women justice to develop further policy call the shadow minister the whole house will remember the murder of sarah everard and the national debate about violence against woman and girl that it provoke sarah parent susan and jeremy have many positive experience of the criminal justice system but they be deeply upset by the restriction that be place on what they could say in their victim impact statement think that be wrong the domestic abuse commissioner think it be wrong and the victims commissioner think it be wrong do the minister think it be wrong have be proud and privileged to meet the everards as well as other family who be member of justice for victims to discuss how we can improve the criminal justice system for victim by put they back at the heart of the system as the shadow minister will know we debate this issue heavily in committee during the victims and courts bill and the department be consider it actively to ensure that the voice of victim be represent in court and at sentencing will happily update he on our discussion about how exactly we can do that and what be the good way of do it welcome that commitment but the minister fail to mention that we table an amendment in committee which she vote against along with number of other labour members give what she have just say will she commit herself now to ensure that an amendment be table during future stage of the bill to prevent restriction on what victim and their relative can say in their impact statement let say yet again that as the shadow minister will know we vote against that amendment because victim impact statement be currently class as evidence in court of law and they have to be quite specific we be aware of the concern of victim what we need to do be put forward workable realistic possibility for how we can well represent their voice in the courtroom we be get on with action whereas the conservatives dither and delay for year we be make sure that victim be represent in our criminal justice system call the liberal democrat spokesperson have constituent who be survivor of violent economic abuse which have involve her abuser occupy one of her property without consent and vandalise it with mound of human excrement render it unrentable at huge financial cost the photograph be disgusting delay in civil court proceeding have force my constituent to live with this for nearly three year what step can the government take both to support survivor who be live in this kind of hell and to speed up the legal proceeding that be currently prevent my constituent from be free once again will the hon gentleman please pass on my sincere thought to his constituent that be horrific situation that no one should have to face the hon member will be aware of our manifesto commitment to look at co habit couple right to ensure that victim survivor and every party have equal access to these right we be currently develop that policy work as well as work across government with the ministry of housing communities and local government the treasury and dwp to look at how we can tackle all element of violence against woman and girl include economic abuse and will happily update he on those discussion in due course grooming gangs criminal justice system what step her department be take to support victim of groom gang through the court system the sexual exploitation and rape of child by groom gang be one of the dark moment in this country recent history in the crime and policing bill we have make groom statutory aggravate factor in sentencing for child sexual offence and we have accept all of baroness casey recommendation include change the criminal law to ensure that adult who penetrate child under be charge with rape be grateful to the secretary of state for her response thousand of child across the uk have be abuse by groom gang yet charity still warn of victim blame by police and those in authority we should be clear that the problem be not child it be those who prey on they what be the government do to ensure that victim be properly support and receive the justice they deserve the hon gentleman raise an incredibly important point that be pick up by the casey report all the recommendation of which the government have accept and have no doubt that the national inquiry will be very cognisant of the issue that he raise through the criminal justice board we will ensure that every part of the criminal justice system from police right through to prison probation and court be aware of how we deal with victim with fairness and justice call the shadow minister sohail zaffer rap child he receive month manzoor akhtar rap child he be sentence to four and half year ramin bari be convict of four rape he get just nine year just two year per rape these man be sentence but not punish do the justice secretary think these sentence represent justice if she do not like most people in this country will she change the law so that rape gang perpetrator receive full life sentence the right hon gentleman will know that can not and will not comment on individual sentence urge he to live up to the responsibility of be the shadow lord chancellor because comment in the way that he regularly do on individual sentencing decision strip of context and without all the information be wrong those be independent decision make by the independent judiciary in individual case prison capacity what step she be take to increase prison capacity we take immediate action to prevent the collapse of our prison system the last government add just place to our prison estate over year whereas the previous labour government add around place over year we intend to match the ambition of the last labour government not the last conservative government which be why we be commit to build new prison place by the end of this parliament we will have more people in prison than at any time in our history every week bring new concern about crime in bournemouth and will pick up this issue with the police and crime commissioner for my area in my boscombe office on friday increase prison space keep dangerous people away from the public and punish serious crime increase prison space stop reoffende and thank tim from athelstan road for his creative suggestion to achieve that which have forward to the relevant minister can the minister outline the step that he be take to stop reoffende especially where it apply to violent crime my hon friend be right public protection be our no priority but we be also tackle reoffende with proper programme in place in prison we also need to support people when they come out of prison and probation be part of that solution in the light of the pressure on prison place what assessment have the minister make of the government early release scheme under which nearly quarter of those release reoffende again within just one year do he believe that the criterion use to determine eligibility be fit for purpose and will he share they with the house due to the circumstance that this government find when we come into office we have no option but to introduce temporary change to the law to allow prisoner serve an eligible standard determinate sentence to be release on licence this have many more constraint to it than the early release scheme operate by the previous government which be rush out just before the election actually the datum have not yet be publish so the right hon gentleman will have to wait for that probation officers what step she be take to support probation officer again mr speaker we be determined to back our hard work probation staff by invest up to million which be increase in funding we have already exceed this year target by recruit over trainee we will recruit another more probation officer in an effective probation service be crucial for the rehabilitation and resettlement of prisoner to reduce reoffende although welcome the number of new probation officer to be recruit napo report that probation workload be unmanageable staff turnover and sickness be high and probation officer be often manage case belong to colleague when evidence suggest that prisoner on licence be less likely to be recall if they have have the same supervising officer from the day of their release can the minister please outline the step be take to address these issue so that morale be improve and probation officer have sufficient time for and attention to give to individual case my hon friend be right that we need to ensure that prison officer have the time to do the job they come in to do which be to spend time with offender and turn their life around in addition we have invest an initial million in technology and launch new programme to develop sustainable work process that will allow probation staff to focus on the work they join the service to deliver thank the minister very much for that answer have the opportunity few month ago to visit the probation office in newtownards to get an idea of what it do be very impressed first by the quality of the staff secondly by the fact that they be involve in restorative justice issue relate to perpetrator and victim and thirdly by the importance they give to ensure that young people have opportunity can the minister tell we from his discussion with the probation board for northern ireland what have be do to ensure that what happen here also happen back home and that what happen back home also happen here thank the hon member for his question as he know we have regular discussion in the five nation group to ensure that good practice be share issue be address together and we learn from each other prison security what step she be take to improve prison security this year we be invest over million in physical security across prison which include anti drone measure to prevent drug and other illicit item from enter prison start this month we will trial the use of taser by specialist staff and we be increase tactical staffing resource to strengthen prison security there have be spate of attack at swinfen hall prison which hold young offender in my constituency drug phone and weapon be often drop in by drone the family of prisoner be concern for their safety and prison officer be at risk what step be the government take to prevent drone and to tackle the high level of violence in our prison thank my hon friend for her question under the last government between and drone sighting around prison increase by over as have say we be invest million in bolster security measure in our prison and we be currently trialle new anti drone netting on the long term high security estate to tackle drone incursion prison staff be face record level of violence and work in such toxic environment that accord to the rademaker review worker be too afraid to raise complaint about bullying and harassment do the lord chancellor therefore welcome today relaunch of the update safe inside prison charter by the joint unions in prisons alliance coalition of trade union represent the vast majority of prison staff if so will she join we this evening to hear more about safe system of work in prison believe the prisons minister may well be attend the event that the right hon member mention will happily pick that up in my regular conversation with trade union official she be right to highlight the scale of violence across our prison system we be already take measure and hope that the combination of sentence reform and investment in our prison will bring down the level of violence we be currently see court backlog and pre trial waiting times what step she be take to tackle the backlog in the court what step she be take to reduce pre trial waiting time this government inherit record and rise court backlog from the previous tory government across every jurisdiction whether for victim of crime parent business or an employee backlog mean wait year for their day in court we have take swift action to invest in our court and court in every jurisdiction be sit at or close to maximum judicial capacity we have announce record investment this year of billion across all court and tribunal which will make real difference to clear up the tories mess in my constituency of horsham have be ask to support woman leave in limbo regard the trial of her ex partner on domestic abuse charge when she be finally give date the trial be pull as result of an administrative error as she sit wait in the courtroom new date be set for whole year later she suffer emotional distress and have to take time off work which cost she she instal cctv at her own expense and endure month of further intimidation will the minister undertake to set clear guideline about maximum waiting time for trial to solve the problem now and in the future be terribly sorry to hear about the case of the hon member constituent which exemplify exactly why we be so determined to grip the backlog in our crown court that be also why we have ask sir brian leveson to recommend once in generation reform to deliver swifter justice for victim such as the hon member constituent ultimately get the backlog down so that we can look she in the eye and say we can deliver swifter justice will make the real difference work closely with fantastic local business across leeds north west and know they already have lot to contend with so be concerned to see pattern of crime on our high street from burglary to other form of vandalism that leave owner in horsforth and adel feel unsafe at the same time like most hon member be very aware that the government have inherit significant backlog that undermine the sense that justice will be serve how do the minister plan to address that so the individual responsible be deal with and small business owner know that we be on their side my hon friend raise an important point the impact of the crown court backlog be be feel by domestic abuse victim and small business so we have real job to do to restore confidence in our criminal justice system that be why we grip the crisis by put in place an extra crown court sitting day record number we understand however that we will need fundamental reform to address the backlog and that be what we have ask sir brian leveson to look at knife crime offender rehabilitation what step her department be take to support the rehabilitation of people convict of knife crime offence halve knife crime be moral mission for the government every young person catch with knife be refer to youth offend team and turnaround be very successful in divert youngster on the cusp of crime away from offend alongside that the government will roll out prevention partnership and young futures hub welcome the minister answer knife crime ruin life and devastate community rightly those responsible must be hold accountable if we be serious about prevent reoffende however we also need structured credible rehabilitation the focus of which must be on prevention and diversionary activity as chair of the all party parliamentary group on boxing have see how grassroot boxing club offer something different structure community and hope that be of particular benefit to young people ask the minister to meet to discuss how boxing can be key part of successfully rehabilitate offender my hon friend be right to point to the range of diversion that can help the rehabilitation of young offender include box club be happy to meet he legal aid agency digital services what step her department be take to restore the legal aid agency digital service as the house will be aware the legal aid agency suffer criminal cyber attack across its system it have work tirelessly to ensure that those who rely on legal aid have not see that legal aid stop and that provider be not leave out of pocket in short it have keep the show on the road with series of emergency contingency measure let we be in no doubt however that it suffer that attack because its it system have be leave in fragile state by the lack of investment from the conservatives we will learn from the crisis and build back well with additional investment two of my local firm mjc law and nottingham law centre have contact about this issue mjc law say this have leave legal aid law firm often small business to decide whether to take on the risk of case and hope they will be approve and pay retrospectively cash flow could become genuinely serious issue for such firm so what step be be take to support they for how long do the minister envisage firm deal with this situation finally on gdpr notice be it sufficient that the laa have simply provide notice on its webpage pay tribute to the legal aid provider across the country who have keep go through this difficult time and who do vital work in the sector as part of the package of contingency business measure we have delegate more decision making to provider and we have commit to backdate criminal legal aid application must assure the house that we will turn the system back on only when we can be sure that they be secure and we can guarantee that we be protect people datum parole board decision serious offenders what step she be take to ensure she can refer parole board decision in case of serious offender to the high court work to implement the power to refer case to the high court be well advanced and we expect to be able to fully update the house later this year the secretary of state be decline to take the power to refer to the high court on unduly lenient parole board decision in case of manslaughter like that of robert brown who kill the good friend of my constituent hetti barkworth nanton will the minister meet to discuss this decision and explore how we can ensure that the secretary of state have all the power necessary to ensure that violent killer like brown be not release early that be horrific case my thought remain with joanna family and friend specifically diana parkes and hetti barkworth nanton who meet last year and who the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones meet this week the previous parliament carefully scrutinise the referral power and the offence that should be in scope be very happy to meet the hon gentleman on this matter with the case of one of the killer of james bulger jon venables come to the parole board again the need for the voice of victim family to be hear in the justice system be come right to the fore my constituent sue who be in the gallery today be be support by the james bulger foundation her son die needlessly he be not support by the people with he who could have offer he aid and get he medical help will the minister meet and sue to hear the tragic detail of this case and discuss the option for change the law to ensure that victim family be properly represent in the justice system my hon friend draw attention to another horrific case think the good way of proceeding be to take up his offer of meeting deport foreign offenders prison capacity if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of deport all foreign criminal on prison capacity removal under this government have be high over the past month than under the conservatives we be go far by expand the early removal scheme so that prisoner with no right to be in this country will be deport and ban from ever return to the uk after serve of their custodial sentence uk prison be at full capacity and of prison place be occupy by foreign national will the secretary of state look to deport all foreign national who commit offence in our country to free up that space as say we have already deport more people in the first year of this government than be the case under the previous government so we be go fast on foreign national offender removal from our prison estate the legal change we be make will bring more offender into scope early in their sentence make they eligible for deportation will the lord chancellor update the house on the conversation she have with international partner on the european convention on human right during her recent visit to the council of europe in strasbourg have very positive discussion with partner country across europe when visit strasbourg where make speech about how the european convention on human right be live instrument and therefore must keep up with the time that be positive conversation and one that this government will be continue in the come month prison education what step she be take to improve the quality of prison education ensure that prisoner have access to education be essential for rehabilitation in order to ensure that prison produce well citizen not well criminal new prison education service contract will be launch later this year which aim to strengthen the quality of delivery and provide consistent assessment of prisoner last week hold roundtable bring together expert to drive improvement and strengthen current education provision in young offender institution thank my hon friend for his response however of prison and young offender institution have be rat as require improvement or inadequate by ofsted on education skill and work provision despite that the prison education service still outsource the same poorly perform contract to poorly perform provider and prison educator be pay less than educator in further education setting cause crisis in recruitment and retention accord to the education committee when we will see the great insourcing in generation and will the

by in year accord to the late datum now the labour government here seem to want to copy the snp why will the labour government not put victim first instead of do what they be do now let dangerous criminal off with short and weak sentence what absolute nonsense let tell the house the definition of soft justice it be what the tory party do build only prison place in year in office that be why we

tell we how many individual have be prosecute for smuggle people in on small boat do not have those figure directly to hand but be sure that if they be available can write to he with the detail ask the justice secretary very simple question about one of the big challenge face our country right now and the whole house can see that she do not have clue this be about not just the pathetically low level of prosecution under her watch but the fact that she have wave through guideline to shorten sentence for immigration offence under the nationality and borders act the most serious offence for facilitation carry life sentence but she be water that down to between and year instead of smash the gang she be slash the sentence why will she not do something for once and stop this honestly the shadow justice secretary really ought to pay more attention to his day job rather than to the job he be look for which the conservative party might give he first have he pay any attention he would know that prosecution do not fall to the ministry of justice they be deal with independently through the crown prosecution service we will of course publish the statistic when we get they and will happily write to he with the detail we be make sure that across government we be take all the action necessary to protect our border he be misrepresent what the immigration guideline do have pick he up on that before will happily write to he again but maybe he could actually read they and learn something peopleplus have just win the contract for prison education in scotland and england peopleplus be sell to talent international subsidiary of swipejobs in which us and australian base venture capital firm clearsign capital have stake accord to the university and college union can the minister explain why venture capitalist be make money out of educate british prisoner my hon friend ask good question in england prison education contract be award follow rigorous commercial process that award

year old father be subject to serious abuse through lasting power of attorney it take two year and significant legal cost to get the power of attorney remove through the court of protection the father tragically die homeless and penniless do the minister believe that the current lpa protection be sufficient to prevent such abuse and will the government consider an urgent review and reform of the system be very sorry to hear about the case of the hon member constituent we need to put this into some context as of march over million lasting power of attorney be register in england and wales they be really useful instrument although concern about misuse do exist the sort of abuse that the hon member highlight be in context rare the office of the public guardian investigate around case last year we be look to strengthen safeguard and add more identify check as part of modernised service last power of attorney be really important tool and we do not want to throw the baby out with the bathwater during my recent visit to pennine domestic abuse partnership in huddersfield hear about how long delay between cps charge and trial date leave abuse victim in limbo the delay not only retraumatise victim but put huge strain on support service that provide long term care so join colleague in ask the government to reduce the delay as soon as possible so that victim of domestic abuse can access justice swiftly my hon friend outline exactly why we have ask sir brian leveson to conduct review into the criminal court the ambition be to reduce the length of time victim have to wait for justice we be expect the recommendation of that review shortly we be support victim by fund key support service to make sure that victim continue to be engage with our criminal justice system and we be expand the use of specialist domestic abuse court where train staff can support victim directly recently meet ruby hamill young activist who nearly die in government run prison when her severe eat disorder be ignore ruby be not constituent she want to talk to because chair the eat disorder all party parliamentary group will the minister meet and ruby family to ensure that there be eat disorder guideline in all prison and that the guideline be appropriate and implement across all prison healthcare provider be sorry to hear of the case that the hon member outline and would be very happy to meet she to explore the issue far in recent report the victims commissioner say that she fear that the delay in victim get justice will drive some victim to give up on seek justice altogether second injustice compound the first this be completely unacceptable and at ipswich crown court the backlog of open case have more than double since what be minister do to reverse the harm inflict by the conservatives not only on the justice system itself but on victim confidence that justice will be serve at all my hon friend be right that we be see an increase in the number of victim pull out of the process because they no long have confidence in it because it be take so long we have fund an additional sit day this year and have ask sir brian leveson to recommend once in generation reform precisely so that we can deliver swifter justice for victim the hon member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball raise the issue of the presumption of contact have constituency case where one parent have abuse their child and the other parent have have to pay for the supervision of those child the presumption of contact be not work in case where domestic abuse have happen so echo the call from the hon member for penistone and stocksbridge for an urgent review of it the hon member will know that staggering of case that go through our family court involve some form of domestic abuse or allegation thereof that be why consideration of the operation of the presumption of contact and wide consideration of domestic abuse allegation in our family court be so important it be why official and ministers be take the process really seriously derbyshire victim services do really important work support victim include those who have experience sexual assault and domestic violence but give the court backlog inherit from the conservative government the service have tell that many of the victim be in need of support for long with many have complex need that public service can struggle to meet what step be the department take to help support service to provide support to victim with complex need that be exacerbate when justice be delay place on record my thank to all the brilliant victim support service that do tremendous work in incredibly difficult circumstance to ensure that victim get the support they need to stay engaged with the criminal justice system we have protect dedicated ministry of justice spend on victim of violence against woman and girl by maintain the funding level ringfence sexual violence and domestic abuse support for this year and commission rape and sexual abuse support line provide victim and survivor with access to vital help and information whenever they need it we be carefully consider how good to allocate the current budget from the spending review to look specifically at vawg alongside other departmental priority my constituent andy from offerton often play caring role for his adult son as his son have serious mental ill health during his son recent stay in prison andy struggle to get quality information from the prison about his son health situation and living condition what more will the government do to ensure that parent carer such as andy get the information they need and deserve during child stay in prison the hon lady be right it be important that parent carer get the information they need that help with rehabilitation and get thing to the right place if she want to write to about that particular case will look into it and write back to she survive be york base charity provide specialist service and trauma specific intervention to survivor of sexual violence and abuse however it have have to close its waiting list because it do not have the capacity to meet the demand will the minister look at provide additional funding so that we can get those vital service to survivor and victim now and they do not have to wait my hon friend have contact and write to on this issue she will know that we in the department be look at the spending allocation follow the spending review however we have protect and ringfence special support for sexual violence victim because we know that there be huge demand come through the system and we need to keep those victim engage in the criminal justice system to ensure they get their day in court and justice be serve read recent bbc article about an asylum seeker who have violently rap teenage girl he have be convict and give sentence of nine year in prison follow by three year on licence after which he will need to be deport be concerned that such individual during their period on licence pose risk to british woman and girl do the lord chancellor agree and will she ensure that people go straight from prison to deportation where appropriate thank the hon lady for raise that important point it be why we be reduce the threshold for the early removal scheme and look carefully with the home office at the gauke review recommendation of effectively sentence to deportation to deal with the very type of case that she have raise welcome the government effort to reform sentencing follow the sentencing review be confident that those step will end the chaos leave behind by the previous government be particularly interested in rehabilitation as priority in sentencing troubling statistic remain study have show that of prisoner in the uk be diagnose as dyslexic and there be probably many more who be undiagnosed mean that the number be much high will the minister tell what step be be take to support dyslexic people in prison and to prevent reoffende follow release my hon friend be right to emphasise the importance of rehabilitation in the panoply of thing that we do in the criminal justice system she be also right to highlight the number of prisoner and people in the criminal justice system who have dyslexia which be one of the many neurodiverse condition in the prison service every prison have neurodiversity officer who co ordinates activity to address that in each prison but if she want to write to about the issue would be happy to respond in more detail the secretary of state will be aware of the deeply troubling revelation over the weekend of the so call halal bride website do she agree that such practice have absolutely no place in britain the regulation of website and content fall either within home office responsibility for criminal law or with the department for science innovation and technology and will happily pick up with they the detail around the regulatory issue that be raise by that case when visit hmp onley the near prison to my constituency have the great privilege to be give tour by the governor mark allen and to see the excellent work of the staff wonder whether the secretary of state would comment on the importance of offering by organisation and company such as greene king which provide cafés and restaurant so that prisoner can be rehabilitate while they be in prison greene king do outstanding work as do other organisation in our prison service they be important partner in deliver well justice the lord chancellor rightly reject murderer alan jermey parole board request for open condition for which his daughter and be extremely grateful understand that mr jermey be now legally challenge the decision so will the lord chancellor revisit my request for meeting with she about this issue the hon member will know that with judicial challenge there will be some constraint as to what can say publicly and indeed even privately in meeting will take advice to ensure that nothing compromise the legal process the sentencing guidelines pre sentence reports act have now receive royal assent and congratulate the lord chancellor on her swift action but it would never have be necessary if sentence guideline be not the preserve of an unelected undemocratic quango in the form of the sentencing council do she agree that we need democratic lock or even vote in this place to approve new sentencing guideline have say many time at this dispatch box that that whole episode reveal democratic deficit be review the role and power and we will come forward with legislative change in due course in the light of the tragic loss of young mother sarah montgomery who be seven month pregnant due to violence which have leave two young girl without mother and impact the entire community of donaghadee in my constituency do the government agree that early intervention particularly through early education be essential furthermore can we look at intensify our effort to prevent domestic violence against woman and young girl and at increase sentence to deter that type of crime thank the hon member for raise this case which will have hit all of we incredibly hard it be horrific and just go to show that violence against woman and girl be at epidemic level in every corner of the united kingdom not just in england and wales be due to meet my counterpart across the devolved nation shortly to figure out exactly how we can well join up to tackle this issue as whole because it will take societal response if the hon member want to meet to discuss this far would be happy to do so the minister will be aware that the recent pathfinder family court pilot have be see as largely successful this be an opportunity to put child at the centre of these case and to end the presumption of contact which put partner and child of abuser at risk will she please advise as to the next step in this process welcome my hon friend question and be grateful to he for raise the pathfinder court these pilot be prove incredibly successful they front load lot of the evidence gathering they put the safety of child and family arrangement right at their heart and they be prove really successful model which be why we plan to roll they out far as part of that as he have hear we will be publish our response to the presumption review very shortly the backlog of case in the isle of wight coroner service be the bad in the country cause pain and distress to too many family some of whom be wait day to find out what be happen to their love one will the minister offer any comment or support to those family and will she agree to meet to discuss how we deal with the problem of the isle of wight coroner thank the hon member for his engagement on this issue he have write to and we have have quite productive conversation about it recently meet the chief coroner to discuss the specific issue on the isle of wight because we know that the delay be cause untold turmoil to family in an already awful traumatic process will happily meet the hon member to discuss way forward but be reassure by the action be take by the chief coroner to address the issue in the isle of wight directly constituent of mine who recently flee france because of domestic violence and abuse after be habitual resident for just day have be order to return to france next week under protective measure what more can the government do to protect woman flee domestic violence in relation to the hague convention and the child abduction act the hon member will know that can not comment on specific case but if he want to write to will happily look at that recently have productive conversation about the hague convention and other and we will happily develop those conversation far may associate myself with your remark mr speaker at the outset of these proceeding about the passing of lord tebbit lord tebbit be great friend of northern ireland particularly of the many fellow victim of ira terrorism may return the lord chancellor to the subject of the backlog in our crown court in northern ireland we have the bad of all record it take an average of day to conclude crown court case murder trial have be stall since last september with no new start date we have minister of justice locally who talk the talk but never walk the walk and particularly do not walk the walk in settle the ongoing remuneration issue that be hold thing up would the lord chancellor bring some pressure to bear on the local justice minister to sort this matter out the hon and learn member will know that for devolved matter it would of course be deeply inappropriate for to try to influence or put pressure on the minister of justice in northern ireland on cross uk basis we regularly meet our fellow justice ministers in the devolved administration and will happily pick up those conversation in constructive way government resilience action plan with permission mr speaker will update the house on the government resilience action plan we be live through period of profound change upheaval in the international order conflict rag in the middle east war be wag on the continent of europe and old norm overturn on what feel like daily basis against that backdrop the government first duty of keep the public safe become all the more important resilience be measure of deep strength and at the same time measure of insurance by deep strength mean fundamental such as good nhs strong spirit of community secure energy system and good flood defence all those thing increase our national resilience we see the vulnerability expose by the covid pandemic in the nhs and in the different impact it have on different worker ethnic minority and member of the community resilience have to be for all not just for some by insurance mean the emergency system scientific capability scale up capability and other measure we would need in crisis everyone know they need insurance but we also know that no one spend their whole income on it that be true for country too by definition preparation for the bad have to sit alongside the week to week provision of the essential service that government run there be no perfectly correct answer to the balance between those two thing what be certain be that the government have to think through the scenario and try to ensure that the country be as well prepared as possible today we set out how we will do that with the publication of our resilience action plan chronic risk analysis and an update on the uk biological security strategy no government can stop every risk from materialise every member of this house understand that we live in world where we be susceptible to much wide range of risk than we be even decade ago cyber attack on household name trade measure that can trigger fluctuation in the price of food or household good power outage the possibility of another pandemic these risk be real and be all different the answer to those share challenge lie in make all part of society well prepare our economy our defence our health system our infrastructure our border our industrial base and our energy security much of it come down to the unglamorous work of deliver improve public service that be what we might call deep nhs that be strong enough to cope an energy system that do not leave we as expose to the spike in the price of oil see in the aftermath of russia invasion of ukraine and science base that can be call into action quickly it depend on the whole of society business the public sector local national and devolved government civil society local resilience forum and every member of this house all share in the burden and pull in the same direction the action plan set we up to do that with focus on three area first assess on continuous basis how resilient the uk be so that we can effectively target intervention and resource when and where they be need secondly enable the whole of society to take action to increase its resilience which will rely on we change the culture around resilience by make it part of our everyday life in practical and simple way be it the owner of business introduce new cyber defence or more informed public that know what to do in order to prepare for different emergency and thirdly improve core public sector resilience we have thousand of frontline public sector worker who be integral to our resilience at local and national level from the employee who keep the energy grid run to local emergency responder pay tribute to they all the action plan bring together range of policy we have already set out our proposal to increase defence spending we be earmark billion of funding for new flood defence and million to secure the uk telecom network and open new resilience academy in north yorkshire that will train people every year from the private and public sector later this year we will have the large ever national pandemic exercise that will test the uk readiness for future pandemic we be also develop risk vulnerability map for public servant apply one of the principal lesson of previous tragedy which be that all too often it be the most vulnerable in our society who be hard hit in the event of an emergency on top of each of those step the action plan and our update on the biological security strategy set out new additional measure include nationwide test of the uk emergency alert that will take place at around pm on sunday september and it will involve notification go out to million mobile phone at once it will be the second time we have use the test on nationwide basis it will last for around second the mobile phone alert system will play critical role in make sure that we be ready for all kind of future emergency in the run up to the test we will work with stakeholder include domestic violence charity to ensure that the public have as much warning as possible as well as the alert we will be push ahead with activity to promote the government prepare website to help individual household and community understand how they can be ready for range of different emergency we continue to support local resilience forum in england because they be essential in plan for and respond to incident whenever they occur our biological security strategy include million from the integrated security fund to help address capability gap across government and beyond that be in addition to the billion of investment that we unveil fortnight ago for new network of national biosecurity centre to strengthen our defence against biological incident accident and attack the defence and security accelerator also include million for project with university such as queens university belfast and cardiff university my colleague the health secretary will publish pandemic preparedness framework explain how the government be bring together the vital scientific research need to prepare for any future pandemic be also able to announce that soon the national situation centre and the devolve government will sign memorandum of understanding to ensure that every part of the uk have the good datum to prepare and respond to crisis those practical step will help the uk to meet the moment when an emergency come resilience be not button to press it come from the realisation that we need deep strength and the ability to scale up quickly when the situation require it that be why the government investment plan announce in the recent spending review and the action outline in this plan be so important we will not be resilient unless we invest for the future strong nhs more and well housing well energy security utilise our deep research and development base and on top of that have the capability to get go fast in an emergency that be what this plan set out commend it to the house thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for advance sight of his statement and the associated documentation also thank he for the date on which the uk emergency alert will be test he can only have choose it to notify the country that it be my birthday shall very much look forward to the alarm at pm understand why the government want to plan for resilience it be understandable that the government would want to come forward with plan face with the collapse economy collapse government capital flight spiral borrowing cost and the office for budget responsibility warning this morning that the chancellor late turn have leave britain more vulnerable and less able to respond to future crisis as the minister say the plan publish today build on the work of the previous government on the roll out of the national emergency alert system the expansion of biosecurity preparedness investment in flood protection and ensure well cross departmental collaboration on resilience and emergency preparedness the minister say in his statement that he be look for an assessment on continuous basis the report set out the intention for data collection in this area but it would be useful to hear by when that new datum framework will be available for we to scrutinise he say that he wish to enable the whole of society to take action but rather wonder how he intend the whole of society to find out about this the plan call on the ministry of housing communities and local government to provide guidance on develop cohesion strategy and to monitor tension however that do not sit easily with the fact that the government be not currently tackle islamist extremism properly that they drag their foot on national inquiry into groom gang and that they seem to be bring forward highly controversial definition of islamophobia the minister refer to improve core public sector resilience that be certainly to be welcome particularly on day on which it have be announce that resident doctor have vote in favour of strike which will result in industrial action in january it be notable that the plan do not mention an ability to deal with widespread industrial action be the government planning for the eventuality of general strike the minister also mention the increase in defence spending which we know be form of smoke and mirror we understand that the in addition to the hypothetical include thing such as tunnel and road but we have not be provide with baseline for what be currently spend in those area how will we know when the government have get to or indeed whether they be at already as the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster set out the previous government take step to extend our capability and publish the first uk biological security strategy be interested that in this strategy there be reference to explore the utility of waste water analysis which have great success during the pandemic do the minister intend to bring that back on wide scale it would be welcome if that be the case be pleased that the government be press ahead with the biothreats radar which be conservative idea but two year after our announcement there be still no go live date this could be major asset to national resilience but we need to know when it will come online the cdl also tell the house that fully operational radar will give we near real time warning of emerge pathogen but the world health organisation be still remind china to hand over its basic virological datum on can he guarantee that the radar will allow the uk to independently verify when state actor choose to withhold or delay information be interested to read about exercise pegasus the preparation for pandemic exercise however as the minister will know different type of pandemic behave in different way which pandemic be test in pegasus which be test in alkarab it be important that the house understand what the government be look at in that regard be grateful to the opposition spokesman for his question several thing have contribute to the need for fresh look at all of this the experience of covid the change geopolitical situation and the change threat picture it be important to be both flexible and dynamic when consider resilience let turn to the shadow minister specific point in advance of his birthday on september wish he many happy return he ask about data collection that do not have date it be constant effort the capacity to use datum in well way today than perhaps we could have do in the past be an additional weapon in our armoury in term of the whole of society find out about this we have good sensible advice on encourage the public to look at it and hope that these preparation measure become normal for people in the future the strength of community be very important in community resilience the shadow minister refer to strike in the nhs we have give the nhs significant financial support and make very fair pay offer we very much value the work that doctor do we hope that everyone in the nhs realise that we be government who support the nhs and want to work with the staff and that industrial action will contribute nothing to that goal the shadow minister refer to biological security we be make important investment into that include the opening of the new weybridge lab announce by my right hon friend the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs couple of week ago exercise pegasus have not happen yet it will happen in the autumn however the shadow minister be right on one thing it be important not to fight the last war and assume that the next pandemic will behave in the same way as the last one we have to be flexible in our response and ensure that we plan for different kind of scenario welcome this statement the point about exercise pegasus remind of exercise cygnus the finding of which be sadden to say the previous government ignore in advance of what then become the pandemic we face in recent week we have see attack on marks spencer the co op and other and the fire at heathrow so this action plan be incredibly welcome it state that the government will develop consolidated data drive picture of our resilience baseline to show how resilient the uk be at any moment and new cyber resilience index that highlight the critical national infrastructure at great risk will my right hon friend give the joint committee on national security strategy which chair access to those index and may suggest that we help he in develop they be grateful to the chair of the joint committee on national security strategy for his question the national cyber security centre have be work closely with marks spencer and the other victim of recent cyber attack look forward to appear before his committee in few day and work closely with it in the future call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for advance sight of the statement the world be now less stable and more insecure than at any time since the cold war consequently the government must ensure that the british people and the united kingdom be prepare in the event that our country or an overseas territory be threaten the liberal democrats therefore welcome any measure to strengthen our resilience especially to the cyber security threat new and evolve threat against which we must be arm while the liberal democrats welcome the alert test we call for wide public information campaign to support resilience build across the uk and to ensure that the public be properly ready for any potential future conflict or disaster perhaps we could take lesson from our scandinavian neighbour who be always work to address future threat and provide information to their citizen information should be provide through number of different mean include leaflet and traditional broadcast while we welcome the alert test website and text alert will miss million of british people those without phone or without signal or battery so we need to be ready on all front and not just rely on single text alert will the government accept the liberal democrats call to launch national awareness campaign that draw on different mode of contact welcome the talk about be more resilient to climate emergency we have all see the horrify picture and upset story from the flood in texas in recent day and in this country we have have one of the hot start to summer in uk history it be vital that the government be not catch unawares as the temperature rise last week have meeting in my constituency with thames water which tell that it be prepare drought mitigation measure the regular supply of water to people property business and agricultural land be vital to livelihood and everyday life what step be the government take and perhaps put in their new action plan to ensure that any drought mitigation measure will not significantly impact the country in the come month welcome the hon lady question and join she in extend our sympathy to all those affect by the terrible event in texas where we see the power of nature and see so many innocent life lose welcome the hon lady comment on the alert test the test will be publicise well in advance include through work with domestic violence charity and other so that everybody know what be come information for the public be available on the website agree with the hon lady that dialogue with the public on resilience be important in many other country that be absolutely normal perhaps it have be little less normal in this country but we should change that on risk in the immediate term our excellent cobra team in the cabinet office scan the horizon constantly for these thing and it be always prepared and ready to go in any emergency thank the minister for his statement as former leicestershire county councillor and as health scrutineer before during and after the pandemic it be clear to that local knowledge from our public health team and nhs service play an important role however they know that they could have go far and do so much more will he reassure and my constituent that insight from local resilience forum and local expert will feed into planning and preparation for any future pandemic that be good question it be really important that we learn from the experience of the pandemic few year ago but we must not fall into the trap as say of assume that the next emergency will be exactly the same we have to be flexible in our response the next emergency and indeed the next pandemic may be quite different in character from the one that we go through few year ago will the preparation take into account the last disastrous consequence of lockdown and the blither absurdity of face covering the preparation should take everything into account thank the minister for the statement welcome the announcement that the government will undertake full national test of the emergency alert system in september how will they ensure that rural area such as church eaton in my constituency which be still wait for its phone mast to be activate and maer which have have long term difficulty with mobile reception can receive the message my understanding be that the alert be dependent on access my hon friend be right about of the population be cover by or access and we be work constantly with the telecom company to improve that coverage that be an ongoing effort welcome the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster commitment that resilience must be for all not just for some the people of shetland will hold he to those word few year ago we suffer catastrophic power outage for about seven day in winter storm leave many of my constituent rely on copper wire phone line for their connection to the outside world if that copper wire be withdraw without sufficient resilience be build into its replacement the consequence for my constituent could be catastrophic will he through his office engage with private sector organisation when they be make these strategic decision for we all the right hon gentleman represent perhaps the outermost part of the uk and when he say that resilience should be for all he be absolutely right we have see the effect of long term day be long outage include in recent time during storm éowyn he make good point about ensure resilience when system change and new technology come in and we will certainly have dialogue with telecom company about that thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for his statement be pleased to hear he reference the million that the government be invest to secure our telecommunications network will that extend to our undersea network of cable which face perpetual threat from the russian shadow fleet and other who be under thin veil of plausible deniability if those network be disrupt it will create chaos in the uk be grateful to my hon friend for that important question subsea cable be vital to the working of our economy and our defence and those who wish we harm know that it must be part of our national defence and our defence think to defend our international communication structure under the sea the tier exercise that cdl mention in response to baroness hallett recommendation in module of her report on covid be much to be welcome however he will be aware that part of the problem with exercise cygnus in be that the result be not make public at the time and lot of it remain classified in the light of what have be say today will he ensure that the government approach to this exercise be different and that the result be make public quickly so that they can be interrogate any national exercise of this kind will show up both strength and weakness it be important that we communicate the learning from these exercise both the strength and the weakness the national risk register identify cyber attack on critical national infrastructure as be of moderate likelihood but potentially catastrophic in impact the national audit office have identify key government system that have substantial cyber resilience gap what more can the government do to plug those gap and ensure that our system be secure this be very important there be no doubt that there be gap in cyber defence and there be an ongoing battle to get up to speed many legacy system that have be in place for decade be difficult to replace because new have be build on old we be invest but it be an ongoing effort to close the gap to stop those who would undermine the vital public service that rely on those system one of the vulnerability that we see in the pandemic after the invasion of ukraine and even during the beast from the east winter storm be to food supply but do not hear the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster refer to food in his statement finland national food supply can sustain the country for up to nine month it include strategic food reserve and grain stockpile germany advise citizen to keep day stockpile of food and water our reliance on import make our food supply vulnerable to global event such as pandemic and geopolitical instability what action be the government take to increase our food security the website refer to have supply of food and water in case of an emergency we recently strike an agreement with the european union that will remove huge amount of the cost bureaucracy and delay in ensure the free flow of food to and from the european union that be good agreement for food security thank my right hon friend for his statement as he rightly say plan and respond to these kind of incident whether it be the pandemic storm flooding or major water outage like the one that happen in my constituency early this year require people across all level of government to work with community how will the resilience plan launch today encourage close work between the devolve government and the uk government my experience in the year since the general election be that on matter such as this co operation and joint working between the uk government and the devolve government be good be pleased to say that this be an area where party politic be usually leave outside the door and think that be right my hon friend be absolutely right when an emergency hit we need good co operation and dialogue with either the devolve government or local authority and local resilience forum which refer to in my statement the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster reference the considerable spending on flood defence over the next few year he will be aware that the port of immingham and much of the south bank of the humber be severely affect by tidal surge in although much work have be do in recent year can he give an assurance to business and resident that the south bank of the humber will remain priority for increase flood defence expenditure we have set aside some billion for investment in flood defence the detail of when and where that will be spend will be set out by my right hon friend the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs thank my right hon friend for his statement one of the most striking conclusion from the covid inquiry be that vulnerable people be the hard hit what step be the government take to ensure that support will reach vulnerable people much more quickly in the event of another incident that be good and important question as say resilience have to be for all not just for some this be take very seriously at the national situation centre as datum get well as for example energy company get well map of their vulnerable customer we be get to well place when it come to know exactly where the government should direct their effort when an emergency hit it be really important part of community solidarity that people of all income group know that the government be there for they when an emergency hit will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster confirm that climate relate emergency be core part of this resilience strategy climate breakdown have the potential to threaten our core infrastructure and pose risk to our core support system such as food and water and the climate change committee say that we be woefully ill prepared for climate relate change so do he agree that the issue should be not political football instead it should be central to the government resilience plan for protect our citizen welcome that question if the hon gentleman want full list of what be on the risk register it be public document so he can look at that refer several time in my statement to energy security to get the energy security that we need we will have to invest in lot of new kit and equipment around the country it be really important that we be allow to build that without people object to it at every turn have call for responsibility revolution in which all business organisation and individual play their part in the national interest have see that in my constituency on visit to the national gas station which be part of the critical infrastructure and when talk to the wolston and brandon flood action group will my right hon friend set out what step the government be take to provide well information to the public so that they can play their part in make our country more resilient very much agree with my hon friend this issue involve the public understanding the risk and think we should make this conversation normal that be why it be right that we do the second emergency test of the system we have use it few time in live scenario in two storm that pose real risk to life during last winter and in one or two more localise situation the public be become more aware but we will continue to make more information available so that people have great awareness of these situation and what they might be able to do to increase their own resilience it be vital that we exclude equipment from company cover by the national intelligence law of china from be use in surveillance equipment on sensitive government site will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster update the house on the progress make in do that as the decision maker for the national security and investment act deal with these issue every day they involve the protection of our vital infrastructure and defence the promotion of our economic wellbeing and ensure that this country be good home for inward investment climate change be very real for we all so build resilience strategy be absolutely crucial in city that flood so regularly it be drought that we be most concerned about not least with the hosepipe ban be introduce this friday will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster ensure that mayoral authority introduce live with water plan so that we can balance flooding and drought and ensure that we have the correct supply of water throughout the year it be really important that we have more investment in our water infrastructure this country have not build reservoir for many many year but the new investment plan reach with the water company since the election will begin to change that picture and improve the deep strength of our energy and water infrastructure which refer to in my statement the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster speak about the cyber attack on household name the business and trade committee hear evidence this morning from the chair of marks spencer who say that more of two way dialogue be need with uk official in which they be effectively give the offer to join and be see as one of the team when these attack occur can the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster confirm how the action plan he have announce today will help with those kind of request from business have have number of conversation with representative of marks spencer since the attack few month ago and be appear before the business and trade sub committee tomorrow to discuss economic security it be really important not just that the company learn from the attack but that the government constantly learn from attack on vital system in much love and cherish british company such as during the covid pandemic be trade union official represent local government worker across scotland see at first hand their extraordinary dedication to our public service but also see when they be let down by lack of co operation and co ordination between the uk government and the scottish government will my right hon friend outline how the resilience action plan will encourage great co operation between government across our devolved nation when there be an emergency there should be no place for performative politic from anyone my experience over the past year have be that co operation on these issue have be good this be an arena in which we should be less partisan perhaps that should be the case in other part of our national life too because in the end the public who send we to this place want to know that help be there no matter the colour or level of government that should be the spirit in which we approach emergency preparedness and resilience welcome the minister statement as well as the fact that there will be more information not just mobile phone alert because those alert do not work evenly even in urban area such as my constituency there be often some delay with some phone one of the question that have arise from the tragedy in texas be whether mobile phone alert be enough people may not be near phone or they may be in remote area so have the government give any thought to more old fashioned way perhaps siren or some other way of alert the public when there be an emergency the mobile phone alert system be significant addition to our armoury as the coverage get well not everyone use mobile phone but very high percentage of the population do however the hon lady be absolutely right that other medium can be use and obviously we keep these thing under constant consideration the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have announce the opening of dedicated resilience academy in north yorkshire which will train private and public sector people per year can he give an update on when that academy will be in place and surety that it will cover the entirety of the united kingdom he speak early about the involvement of the uk government with devolved region so it be critical their representative be cover by that academy as well there have be facility in north yorkshire for some time but open it as the uk resilience academy few month ago it be in place and the plan be to train people every year include first responder and sometimes people from the private sector hope that that training benefit people from right across the uk the first line of defence in national resilience be we the citizenry the health secretary and the education secretary write recently lament the absence of much need grit among many of our young people now that that risk have be identify at the high level of government do it appear on the risk register we talk about the whole society approach because we understand that the public we as the hon gentleman say have to be part of it government have its role to play but it will not do everything the public have really important role to play in resilience somerset be so often at the forefront of climate change recently somerset rivers authority set up community flood action fund to provide small grant for small scale work to reduce flooding in somerset these local community lead intervention can make all the difference on the ground but fund be limited so how will the new resilience action plan future proof local community against climate relate risk and how will it work to support local community intervention such as the sra community flood action fund those community initiative sound excellent as say in my statement the government have set aside some billion for investment in flood defence over the come year we have all see how thing have change over the past or year and it be critical that we put in place the protection that community need thank the minister very much for his answer and his statement this afternoon the recent cyber attack on and other have show the devastation that can be work by the might of keyboard with trust in northern ireland use encompass and those in england use the integrate care system what plan do the government and the minister have to ensure we have the capacity to be inform and to treat patient should an nhs attack or shutdown take place congratulate the hon member on his wonderful tartan tie which have catch my eye today he be the well dress man in the house he be absolutely right about attack on the health system it be frankly outrageous that people out there would seek to disable part of the nhs as means of extortion and it be really important that we do everything we can to defend the nhs and stop patient from be subject to delay in their treatment because of these outrageous attack thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for his statement this afternoon road and rail projects with permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement on how we be reconnecte britain today be announce one of the most transformative investment in our transport network for generation we be greenlighte over rail and road project touch every corner of the country from more rail capacity in oxford and well road in newcastle to new station in devon this be what deliver on our plan for change look like we say we would raise living standard so today announcement be about take the brake off growth support new job and slash journey time we say we would build million new home so we be directly support the construction of new property show how transport can lift up community and improve life we say that we would accelerate to net zero so not only will we make our road safe and less congested and continue the transition to electric vehicle in sensible way we will get more people on public transport back our railway with new link and more electrified track more job new housing and well journey be the people priority and they be my priority too none of this be inevitable we be here because this government be restore stability to our finance and honesty to our politic thank to the year infrastructure strategy we be commit at least billion for infrastructure over the next decade restore confidence drive growth and transform how project be deliver through phase of the spending review billion will be spend on get britain move we have already confirm where some of that money be go include billion of pound for upgrade on the trans pennine route which be the backbone of our northern city commitment to build the east west railway line to cambridge the big ever investment in local transport across the midland and the north and over billion to enable transport for london to continue with the purchase of new piccadilly bakerloo and docklands light railway train as the chancellor say last month we will also be confirm plan for northern powerhouse rail soon today though can provide more detail on how we will use our wide spending review settlement let start with our main highway it should come as no surprise when say that the strategic road network be one of our most important national asset carry one third of all traffic and two third of our freight and generate billion for our economy those essential artery sustain our business our trade and our very way of life however with much of the network build in the and not only be many route in need of renewal there be pinch point where nothing short of new infrastructure will do as such after careful consideration can announce that we will fund five more strategic road enhancement project that start with link up the and the and expand capacity on the which mean well link for thousand of worker in the midland and support over new home across derby we will also start work on continuous dual carriageway on the across the pennines which will strengthen road safety cut journey time by minute and get more people to the region stunning national park we have set aside funding for the newark bypass scheme and the simister island interchange in greater manchester with both scheme now await the outcome of the live planning process some of trip directly depend on our road network whether it be cycling bus walking or car you name it our road carry it that be why we be invest record funding with enough to fill an extra million pothole this year and why we extend the temporary cut in fuel duty at the last budget this government will always be on the side of the british people who depend on our road day in day out today we be go even far have approve full business case on the middlewich eastern bypass and the from drumbridge to newton abbot mean that they can now enter construction can also announce that we have secure funding to continue to take forward scheme from somerset to skipton and from newcastle to north hykeham have speak about the dozen of scheme that will transform road journey across the country the decision we have make prioritise those essential trip to work to the shop and to see loved one and keep our vital freight sector move let turn to the project that will deliver more reliable journey for passenger on our railway we know that rail investment outside london be well overdue the spending review ramp up funding for the trans pennine route upgrade for new station and capacity improvement in wales and for east west rail the new midland rail hub will see the region most ambitious rail improvement scheme to date thank to government funding huge number of additional train and million extra seat could be add to service in and out of birmingham each year but it be not just about deliver big ticket project can today announce new rail station at wellington and cullompton in the south west which will bring significant benefit to local community follow representation from mayor david skaith and my hon friend the member for york outer mr charters have also decide to fund the reopening of haxby station on the york to scarborough line we will replace the aged signal system on the tyne and wear metro secure the benefit of that service for the next generation have listen carefully to mayor helen godwin and my hon friend the member for north somerset sadik al hassan about the need to reopen the portishead line and today can confirm that we will do just that connect additional people to the rail network make no mistake these and other project will not just improve the passenger experience they be down payment on future economic growth well connectivity and the new job and home that this government have promise know that some hon member will have specific scheme in their constituency that be at the early stage or have not be fund in this spending review period or that be cancel but not announce as such by the previous government let reassure colleague that many be worthy project and we will keep they under review the soon to be publish infrastructure pipeline will set out our long term outlook and give colleague the transparency that for year they have sorely lack it be important to set the context we know that critical infrastructure project be promise we know that expectation be raise sadly we know that there be no plan to pay for they indeed scheme that form part of the previous government major road network programme all of which be mean to be in construction by now have not progress as expect almost half be yet to reach the outline business case stage despite be in the programme for six year year of dither and delay waste everyone time and leave community in limbo that must say be the tragic legacy of the farcical network north announcement make by the previous prime minister it therefore fall to this government to make the difficult but necessary choice about future transport project we have to level with the british public provide much need certainty and govern with integrity only those project that be fully cost affordable and deliver return on taxpayer money will be give the green light under my watch that mean no more black hole no more busted budget and no more promising the moon on stick those day be over have therefore take the difficult decision on the strategic road network not to progress the widen scheme that and dualle the be two of the most expensive strategic scheme on the table and it be impossible to continue with both we have also decide not to progress the wansford to sutton scheme we be already invest more than million on improvement to the corridor with work to dual section in norfolk already under way but it be just not feasible to support further investment at this time understand that some community will feel frustrated but by take this decision we be rebalancing fund towards those area that for too long have not have the infrastructure investment they deserve the north and midland will now get high proportion of strategic road spend than we have see in the past five year believe that be the right and fair thing to do finally the previous government spend many year and lot of money develop plan for large local scheme and major road network project that be never go to be affordable and therefore never get off the ground we can not go on like that although have today write to colleague and council about scheme that we will fund many other now need to be review my official will work with council on which scheme to prioritise and will update the house on next step once those discussion have take place we be make once in generation commitment to get britain move well road and new rail link will raise living standard increase opportunity and deliver on our plan for change throughout we will always put the british people first that mean be honest about the inevitable trade off understand that financial stability remain the bedrock of economic growth and ensure that we always deliver the good value for taxpayer money truly believe that talent exist across this country yet poor connectivity be drag on opportunity and place ceiling on people aspiration that change now we will reconnect britain and we will deliver the world class transport infrastructure that this country need that be my mission commend this statement to the house before call the shadow secretary of state remind the transport secretary that it be always open to she to ask for more time for her statement there be minute limit so if the shadow secretary of state would like more time he too will get it thank you madam deputy speaker thank the secretary of state for her statement and for advance sight of it make no mistake infrastructure be the connective tissue that bind our economy together our railway and strategic road be the vein and artery of our economy connect business up and down the country that be why these announcement be to be welcome just as they be when they be previously announce by the last conservative government for example the to link road and the portishead branch line be both announce and grant permission under the last conservative government the new station at wellington and cullompton and the midland rail hub be all approve under the previous conservative government the development consent order for the northern trans pennine project be sign in march last year under the last conservative government interruption the secretary of state call from sedentary position where be the money as she well know that be in the last spending period and the forthcoming spending review be always go to be after the general election could go on and on because every single scheme announce by the government today be the result of the work of the previous conservative government therefore can not muster the same enthusiasm as she when it come to today announcement the truth whether they know it or not be that the secretary of state and her ministers have be send to this house today to stage distraction because in recent week we have see the economic credibility and political unity of this government implode we have see the chancellor who promise to maintain an iron grip on the public finance force to contend with unfunded turn after unfunded turn all because the prime minister have lose control of their back benchers we know what it mean more taxis for family and for business the chancellor have admit it herself we also know the impact that this will have on the economy in the last few month the office for budget responsibility the bank of england and the oecd have all downgrade the uk growth forecast by as much as half in the case of the obr so be afraid that the government be kid themselves if they believe that reannounce transport infrastructure project that be already in the pipeline will revive an economy that be falter after disastrous first year in office with the tax burden reach an historic high inflation almost double the bank of england target and inactivity rise because the government be seemingly incapable of implement any kind of meaningful welfare reform far from fix the foundation they be actively undermine they quite aside from the fact that these reannouncement on their own will not revive our falter economy no deadline have be set for the completion of the project and in the light of that must question whether the funding for they be as secure as the right hon lady claim give that the obr be expect to downgrade growth and productivity forecast not to mention labour turn we know that the government have create black hole of billion of pound in the public finance so must ask the right hon lady how confident she be that fund will not be cut from these project to fill the chancellor economic black hole do she recognise that these project alone will not revive an economy that be falter under the government economic mismanagement and will she give timeframe for they not just to be start but to be complete what we have see in recent week be the follow prime minister whose unpopularity with the public be apparently exceed only by his unpopularity with his own back benchers and who be now clearly at their mercy chancellor who be wilt under the strain and government with no new idea out of steam after only one year in office and force to rely on idea think up by other people it be no surprise that ministers would like to speak about anything other than their own record in office but britain deserve well than this sometimes wonder what alternative reality the hon gentleman be live in network north may have promise everything to everyone but not penny of it be fund and promise local area scheme that the conservatives know would never materialise be no way to run government and no way to run country this government be now provide certainty to those area give the green light to important road and rail scheme and be honest about what we can not afford do not know whether the hon gentleman catch what be say by the former rail minister huw merriman to the transport committee last week but he have this to say about the record of the last government lot of promise be make to mps and other as to the ambition but it do not match the amount that be actually be set down by the time come into post end up with list that be much long than could be fund rest my case the hon gentleman talk of nothing be new let give he some example of new project that we be announce today we be upgrade the tyne and wear metro replace signal system that date back to the and enable the extension of the metro to washington we be provide new railway station wellington and cullompton in devon portishead and pill with connection to bristol and haxby in north yorkshire which will connect ten of thousand of people to the rail network can the hon gentleman tell which conservative transport secretary commit fund to those scheme he can not because none of they do let also give one of the new road as an example the middlewich bypass in cheshire the previous government reject the business case for that scheme but this government be fund it new infrastructure new railway station and new road connect every part of our country that be the difference that labour government make call the chair of the select committee welcome the statement and be sure that the roads minister will ensure that the various road project deliver for local resident walk along and across the new junction and benefit they as much as they benefit driver the strategic road network project be clearly important to deal with congestion but can assume that each one have be subject to robust appraisal and business case development and may ask when we will see the equivalent work be do to address the chronic capacity crisis on the west coast main line can assure my hon friend that the scheme that be go ahead have be subject to very robust business case appraisal we believe that they offer the taxpayer value for money and can unlock the connectivity that be so critical to drive economic growth across the country my hon friend also ask think understand her question correctly about capacity on the west coast main line we be aware of capacity constraint between birmingham and manchester which be predict to last into the next decade and although we have make it clear that we will not reverse the decision to cancel phase of we be review option for address those capacity issue in the future call the liberal democrat spokesperson people around the country have be plague and let down by transport system that be completely neglect by the last conservative government the problem have range from pothole to cancel bus service along with entirely fictional budget for rail and other transport project give that safe reliable transport system be vital to economic growth this capital investment be of course welcome news we be pleased to see the government answer the call of liberal democrats and other campaigner for vital upgrade such as new rail investment and improvement on the northern trans pennine route give the hard fought campaign by local people in my constituency particularly welcome the confirmation of new station at wellington first propose in the house by my predecessor jeremy browne and cullompton can not go quite as far as the secretary of state in agree to relocate wellington in devon it remain in somerset but both those rail project be long overdue and thank the secretary of state for engage with not just but my hon friend the members for honiton and sidmouth richard foord and other on both side of the house include the hon member for exeter steve race who see be present on the vital importance of those station to the regional economy the long overdue funding for the west midland rail hub be also welcome let now turn to the road infrastructure project many of the scheme announce today have be seek for many year we be pleased to see investment in the for which my hon friend the member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron have consistently campaign as well as investment in infrastructure in manchester derby and nottingham however we still need clarity on exactly how the fund for these project will be spend after year of delay broken promise and mismanagement not least on public confidence in the government ability to deliver major infrastructure be understandably low give the effect of inflation during the month delay of the wellington and cullompton station project among other can the secretary of state confirm that that project will be fully fund and complete in the two year that it will take to construct the station when will the government finally publish detailed plan for northern powerhouse rail can the government give the country firm assurance that all these project will be deliver on time and on budget in cost effective manner can assure the hon gentleman that will do everything in my power to ensure that future transport project be deliver on time and on budget he ask about northern powerhouse rail as say in my statement we will provide further detail about that in the come week he be right to mention the two new station wellington in forgive somerset and cullompton which be locate between exeter and taunton will provide vital new connection for those regional centre support economic growth and plan housing in the area as the hon gentleman have put the case to directly before know that both town have significant expansion plan so those station will be critical to give local people access to job at major employment centre such as the one in exeter welcome the statement and thank the transport secretary for all the positive engagement that she and other ministers have have with the midland rail project at the heart of those work be the upgrade of king norton station in my constituency which be critically important for the cross city line and be also the birthplace of thomas the tank engine the secretary of state will understand that we as local mp be press for that next level of detail so will she help to keep up the head of steam around this project and leave commuter in my constituency feel chuffed to bit can not possibly compete with those railway pun but be delighted that my hon friend constituent have such strong advocate for public transport and investment in the rail network he be right to say that the midland rail hub can have transformative impact and thank he for all that he have do in champion the scheme over the month he have be such positive member of this house thank the secretary of state for her statement but be really disappointed that the tavyrail scheme have receive red light we have hear quite lot about the investment in devon and somerset the government be deliver huge amount of investment in plymouth which be welcome but without rail link between tavistock and plymouth that can continue far into my constituency at ivybridge struggle to see how the investment in defence and housing will be fulfil give that the secretary of state be commit at least billion for infrastructure over the next decade would be interested to know why she could not find million to fund the business case for tavyrail we be keep number of scheme under review and we will set out pipeline of future infrastructure scheme that we believe be worthy but which have not be fund in this spending review be happy to receive more detail about the particular scheme that the hon lady raise the announcement of upgrade to the northbound junction be hugely welcome it will make get to stafford from telford much easy and have really positive impact on our economic development when do the secretary of state anticipate that that work will start so that my county can keep benefit from this government be grateful to my hon friend for her question we will set out the timetable for the delivery of these scheme as we produce the next road investment strategy which we will have do by the end of march next year for long and weary year my hon friend the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers and have campaign for through train from grimsby which would stop at market rasen and end up in london we have be make numerous promise by network rail which be now say that the platform be too short that bridge need to be build and that it will cost million the usual negativity the secretary of state be feisty minister promise she that if she get we our train will campaign for it to be rename the heidi alexander heroine of lincolnshire feel that be make progress because the last time the right hon gentleman ask question believe he suggest that name train after margaret thatcher politely decline he will get everywhere with flattery of course the digital signal on the east coast main line will have positive impact on service but be afraid can not make commitment on the particular service that he want at this time transport be the backbone of our economy so the record billion investment in rail and road project be hugely welcome the secretary of state be right to say that we need more people on public transport although luton station will finally see work start on its much need lift we need to tackle the poor state of the station in order to encourage more people to use the railway will the secretary of state or one of her ministers meet to discuss how we can do so my hon friend make fair point station need to be welcome and attractive place be pleased that the accessibility improvement be happen at luton station and would be very happy to meet she as she request however the secretary of state dress this up her labour government aid by mayor parker be still leave community such as aldridge behind by push our train station project into the siding give her announcement or reannouncement of the midland rail hub can she confirm whether she be committed to fully fund the whole project include all the chord and when will it be deliver we will set out more detail on the midland rail hub in due course simply observe that when the right hon lady be rail minister she be unfortunately unable to deliver the station for which she now advocate congratulate my right hon friend on her statement and welcome the investment in transport let take she back to the propose liverpool manchester railway line because it be important that this deliver for my constituent in widnes and halewood in her discussion with the mayor of the liverpool city region and other leader in the area will she bear in mind that one of the proposal be for liverpool gateway station ditton in my constituency which be the site of an oil station and have good link to both the west coast main line and the freight line be ideally place will she bear that in mind in any future discussion that she have with the liverpool city region let assure my hon friend that be in frequent discussion with

greater manchester be key part of that funding be aware of the campaign for full service to reddish south and encourage my hon friend to keep work with the mayor of greater manchester and transport for greater manchester to build the case for it the secretary of state have make reference to those area of the country that want transport infrastructure project and have not get they may ask she to spare thought for those place that have get transport infrastructure project that they do not want she know that high speed pass through my constituency but deliver no benefit to the people represent in future round of consideration for rail and road project will she consider give priority to those place that be suffer in that way but which have real need for other type of transport infrastructure

wales get the infrastructure they need spiral cost mean that wales be owe at least billion from yet as the hon member for monmouthshire catherine fookes say we be set to receive just million over year period which will be use for five station with nothing west of cardiff st clears in my constituency have be promise station for year can the secretary of state say if there will be any additional money for this vital project or be we expect to be grateful for the continue underfunding of welsh railway we be see step change in the amount of funding that this government be put into the welsh rail network the million will fund development project as well as the delivery of some new infrastructure and that be in south wales and also in north wales would be happy to speak far to the hon member about the scheme in her constituency that she have mention much of what be in today statement be of course welcome but for place such as bradford that have be leave behind for generation we need to go much far so again make the case for connection for bradford to the trans pennine route as part of northern powerhouse rail this along with new rail station and bus station will unlock billion in economic output which be growth not just for bradford but for the whole region while appreciate that the secretary of state be say the decision on northern powerhouse rail will be announce in due course bradford can not wait for that growth can she give specific time when that will be announce and can she confirm that bradford will be include as part of the trans pennine route be very aware of the case that my hon friend and the leader of bradford council have put forward for new station as he note we will be set out our plan for northern powerhouse rail in the come week the large road programme in the uk be the low thames cross from tilbury to gravesend it be now schedule to cost about billion and the government say that or more of that will be fund from the private sector ask the secretary of state last month on the floor of the house which institution exactly be go to finance that and she reply in essence get back to you so can ask she again because the long the government refuse to answer this question the more sceptical people in essex and kent will become about whether that much need vital strategic link be ever go to get build at all one of the first thing do when come into this post be to agree with the treasury that we would explore private finance option for the low thames crossing we be work at the moment on secure suitable private sector partner to finance the scheme however think the right hon member have bit of brass neck if be honest his government sit on planning application for year and year this government within year of come into office have grant planning consent and have decide to take forward the scheme with private finance because we know how critical that crossing will be for people live in kent and essex and also for the freight and logistic company that will use it thank the secretary of state for the statement and welcome the long overdue and funded commitment to the new cullompton train station which will benefit exeter commend the activist across the area for their successful campaign and also welcome the work do by the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos do the secretary of state agree with that continue to invest in public transport infrastructure and accessibility at station such as exeter st thomas will help city such as exeter to grow their economy sustainably deliver job and well living standard for everyone in those city agree that accessibility at railway station be critical obviously it be key for disabled member of our community but it be also vital for young parent travel with pram and buggy or people go on holiday with heavy suitcase my hon friend have be real champion for new lift at exeter st thomas station and while it be not currently on the list of feasibility scheme that we be do be sure he will continue to make the case to for its worth the link road in my constituency be something that my constituent and have long campaign for because many resident in the village of featherstone hilton and shareshill be currently affect by traffic try to link on to the which have an impact on people life can the secretary of state assure we that everything will be do to ensure that the scheme move quickly and be build as swiftly as possible can give the right hon gentleman that assurance want to see spade in the ground as soon as possible so that people can benefit from that vital new piece of road infrastructure thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for her pragmatic approach to government rather than the previous pie in the sky approach it would be remiss of not to mention broadmead road bridge in redbridge which have be close to vehicle traffic since after year of austerity redbridge council do not have the fund to reopen it and be sure she know from her previous role that the mayor of london also do not have any money give that the bridge affect five constituency run over the central line and connect to the the and the can she please include its restoration in her plan to upgrade road and railway across the country have meeting with my right hon friend the member for ilford north wes streeting recently who make similar case about broadmead road bridge in the spending review we secure fund to set up structure fund to ensure that the government can make money available to local authority with fail asset where the cost of the asset be so great that it would be prohibitive for the local authority to address it on its own we will be issue call for evidence to ask for feedback on how good to structure that fund and hope to be able to say more about its design before the end of the year improved rail link be vital to support the plan development around ashchurch and northway in my constituency include garden community and an outlet centre that open next week current service to ashchurch for tewkesbury station be limited and unreliable with the near arterial road routinely gridlocke welcome the funding for the midland rail hub but my constituent will be eager to learn whether funding for improvement at ashchurch for tewkesbury will be incorporate in that funding if may will write to the hon gentleman with the detail he request thank the secretary of state for her statement and more importantly for her commitment to the midland rail hub that be not just warm word and empty promise but breakthrough moment for the west midland especially town such as redditch the scheme will deliver extra service and million more train seat year for my business and constituent would she therefore like to visit redditch to see what that improvement will mean for our town and perhaps to get the spade in the ground as quickly as possible to deliver the project would be delighted to visit the constituency of my hon friend who be great champion for redditch know what transformative project the midland rail hub could be for his constituent by improve capacity into moor street station in birmingham look forward to discuss it more when visit obviously the secretary of state have an open invitation to visit crowborough and wadhurst station will follow on from the secretary of state reply to my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh about the service between grimsby cleethorpes and king cross the secretary of state rightly mention digital signal on the east coast main line which will improve capacity but five train day already run between king cross and lincoln all that we be ask be for they to continue the last mile through market rasen and grimsby to cleethorpes there would be minimal expenditure apart from think safe crossing at market rasen station and it would help the economic growth of the north lincolnshire area the hon gentleman make compelling case as say we prioritise the scheme that we have announce today on the basis of the one that will deliver the great improvement to passenger most quickly know that there will be other scheme worthy of investment but that be why we have not announce the particular service and scheme that he want today in the year of the anniversary of the railway my rail city of york will greatly welcome the announcement about haxby station the line in question will address congestion issue and provide economic opportunity in my constituency the train will arrive at york station but the rear of that station be not yet accessible will the secretary of state ensure that as we develop our network we have real access for all disabled people and other so that we can gain the benefit from these new announcement if my hon friend write to with further detail of the access issue at the rear of york station will be happy to speak to the rail minister and relevant organisation to see whether there be improvement that we can make appreciate that we need accessible station if everyone be to benefit resident in somerton and langport be isolate from the railway line that run right through the area some resident could benefit from new station but hope for that station take massive hit when the chancellor cancel the restore your railway fund what step will the secretary of state take to introduce train link for community such as somerton and langport in the short term will she commit to expand integrated bus route so that my constituent can get to the near railway station we will publish an integrated national transport strategy later this year to address precisely the sort of issue that the hon member raise about the criticality of bus link to station in the absence of new station my predecessor and the chancellor take the decision to cancel the restore your railway programme because it be unaffordable in its entirety but where scheme offer good value for money and really transformative benefit for the local economy such as the wellington and cullompton scheme and the portishead scheme that we have announce today hope that we have show that we be prepared to look at they and take they forward thank the secretary of state for her statement welcome the announcement about the bypass give that the go through my constituency and about the midland rail hub that will connect nottingham to birmingham as chair of the all party parliamentary group for the east midland however must mention the electrification of the midland main line believe that the department have receive representation from more than east midland mps the mayor office and the appg about the project this feel like miss opportunity what step be be take to make sure that the project be not miss but continue to be debate and discuss by the department believe that my hon friend and some of his east midland colleague be meet the rail minister later this week to discuss the midland main line electrification phase the cost of the scheme be substantial and we have to prioritise other scheme that deliver more tangible benefit to passenger soon however we will keep the electrification scheme under review as part of our pipeline of project for future funding how can possibly welcome the secretary of state statement when by her own admission she have cancel the widen scheme and say nothing about the dualling of the between braintree and marks tey how do she intend braintree colchester and tendring to deliver the massive new housing target impose by the government with no new road or rail infrastructure at all the simple truth be that we inherit series of commitment that could not be afford so we have to take the difficult decision not to progress some project national highways will now work to bring those project to close will say that on the if there be individual small scale intervention that could unlock or address particular problem we would be happy to look at those welcome the improvement to the and the midland rail hub which will mean extra train through burton every week the secretary of state will know that have be campaign for the corridor which be essential for local people and business the roads minister will remember the time when she visit my constituency and get stick in traffic on the what progress might we hear on this vital corridor upgrade can assure my hon friend that we will look carefully at the scheme as part of our planning for the next road investment strategy he will have hear say that we plan to publish draft of that later this year and to have that finalise by the end of march we in northern ireland have salutary experience recently when major road project on our be strike down by the high court because of failure to comply with net zero expectation under the climate change act give that the legislation be very similar in great britain be the secretary of state satisfied that all these new road project will not also fall foul of the net zero campaign can assure the hon gentleman that the environmental impact of all road scheme be consider carefully before business case be approve and plan approval be give in fact in many case scheme tackle congestion hotspot will deliver environmental benefit in particular air quality and noise benefit be not concerned about the possibility of what the hon gentleman suggest but be grateful to he for highlight that case in northern ireland when heathrow airport set out its growth plan key component of they will be the plan for improved access by public transport will the secretary of state urge it to look at the southern rail link which should run through my constituency specifically of course it could have huge benefit across the south east and would connect we to the airport we expect any promoter of an expand heathrow to consider how people will get to and from the airport neither my hon friend nor want to see the or turn into europe large car park expect any scheme promoter to ensure that ease of access by public transport be take into account when put together any proposal welcome the commitment to deliver east west rail stick with the railway will the secretary of state provide assurance to my constituent that she be committed to deliver step free access in particular at harlington and flitwick station on road junction of the be desperately in need of remodelle to cope with grow population and to ease traffic flow what assessment have be make of the benefit of remodelle that junction would need to write to the hon gentleman with the detail on junction of the hear the case that he make for improved accessibility at harlington and flitwick station and would be happy to correspond with he far on whether they be cover by the feasibility study that we be do we have fund available in this spending review to construct some of those scheme and would be happy to provide write update on that in my four year as shadow transport secretary the issue of electrification be never far from the top of the agenda and very much welcome secretary of state announcement around the trans pennine route upgrade however may point out that the north of england be not confine to the conurbation in that immediate area there be more to it than that in the electrification taskforce establish that the line from northallerton through to thornaby and middlesbrough in my constituency and indeed onwards to redcar the heart of net zero teesside be right at the top of the tier when the infrastructure pipeline come forward urge the secretary of state to take into consideration the gross value add that the extension would bring because teesside and the tees valley be ready to make their contribution to grow this economy and the extension would ensure that they could my hon friend make powerful case that case be why even if we be not commit funding in this spending review to electrification project we will keep they under review as we move forward we be also consider and develop our strategy on rail decarbonisation more broadly most of our exist arterial route be now electrify there be also rapidly evolve technology there be bi mode and even tri mode train now we need to consider our strategy in the round welcome the minister statement and it be good that devon make it on to the map just many on the liberal democrat benches and other across the house travel from paddington down to the far south west and we have speak with your department about the effect of the old oak common work on that line can the minister confirm that the department be consider mitigation for the effect of the old oak common development namely ensure more capacity and reliability potentially electrify the main line to the west and improve connectivity on those train your would assume that be run transport be minister in that department once but not any more call the secretary of state in the past couple of week we announce project reach which will improve mobile connectivity in number of tunnel and siding and some of those improvement will take place over the great western railway network on the work at old oak common the rail minister be very alive to the question of how we minimise disruption for user of the gwr service both in the construction phase and once be in operation and be look in detail at that of course when it be finally open the station will offer valuable interchange for gwr customer who will be able to go to birmingham without go into central london boost growth and prosperity across the country and especially in rural and coastal area be vital what be the secretary of state deliver for cornwall to help town and village in my area include saltash liskeard and polperro particularly as we work to find long term sustainable and fair solution to the issue of the tamar crossing my hon friend be in contact with directly couple of day ago about mobile connectivity improvement on gwr that improve service in her constituency know that an integrated bus network in cornwall be absolutely vital to her constituent and through our bus services no bill we want to give local leader more power to shape the bus network that community like hers need and deserve as the secretary of state know the big connectivity issue for the isle of wight be its ferry service welcome her engagement on that issue might she consider cross solent ferry service to be part of the uk road and rail network the isle of wight road and rail be connect to the rest of the uk only via entirely privatised very expensive and completely unregulated ferry company understand the importance of reliable and affordable ferry service the isle of wight ferry service be obviously provide privately and our road network and our rail network especially will increasingly be in public ownership in the future while can not commit to do what he ask can commit to work with the hon gentleman and his colleague on the isle of wight my hon friend the member for isle of wight west mr quigley to try to improve this situation for their resident today announcement be great news for people across lichfield burntwood and the village to the north we have improvement on the make access to the university of derby easier to the west we have improvement to the and link road which will be great for access to the and to telford and wales to the south we have the midland rail hub which will be excellent for the cross city line all we need be for reform control staffordshire county council to the east to sort out chetwynd bridge then we will have the entire compass cover turn to the south the cross city line be the busy commuter line outside of london but since covid we have have just two train an hour from lichfield trent valley to birmingham the midland rail hub will get we back up to four will the secretary of state come to lichfield to meet potentially on her way to redditch and ensure that we can deliver more train on the cross city line as quickly as possible my hon friend be clearly at the heart of all the action today have accept an invitation to visit redditch how can refuse visit to lichfield would be happy to talk to he more about the challenge of and opportunity for midland transport when visit the secretary of state say that she be reconnecte britain and then proceed to mention wales only once these plan will not give we the boost that we need in wales we be the poor nation in the uk invest in infrastructure deliver economic growth and boost productivity that be true so why have she give up on wales will we ever see the full electrification of the north and south main line can assure the hon gentleman that this government have not give up on wales in fact it be the precise opposite it be why during the spending review the chancellor stand at this dispatch box and announce million of investment into rail project right the wrong of that historic under investment the fight for the middlewich eastern bypass start more than year ago and after all these year of false start dash hope and frustrated resident could not be prouder that this labour government be finally deliver on that project after year of under investment in area such as mine it be really encouraging to see the government deliver the funding that be need to make such vital infrastructure project reality the recent reform to the treasury green book champion by my hon friend the members for congleton sarah russell and for rossendale and darwen andy macnae have clearly play crucial role in enable project such as this to move forward well reflect the need and potential of town like middlewich how do my hon friend see the middlewich eastern bypass along with the other road scheme that she have greenlit contribute to the long term economic growth and support more balanced and inclusive development across all part of the country be really pleased to be able to announce today the green light for the middlewich bypass know that that new km of single carriageway bypass to the east of middlewich will make big difference to my hon friend constituency unlock swifter easy journey and more route to employment and opportunity for his constituent for which he so powerfully advocate thank the secretary of state for greenlighte the work on the into newton abbot that will be massive improvement when it be complete may congratulate the successful team at teignbridge and at devon county council who have be work on the project for some while however be disappointed to hear that dawlish be not on the list and will be put back indeed although be pleased that the government will be continue to fund the monitoring of the cliff may draw it to the secretary of state attention that it be single catastrophic shift rather than gradual increase of the situation that cause the collapse of the cliff at dawlish that shut the railway for eight week cause approximately billion of damage to the south west economy as say in response to the hon member for torbay steve darling we have already heavily invest in secure the cliff and make the coastline more resilient in dawlish we be keep that final phase of work under review and it will be possible to determine the next course of action only once that further cliff monitoring and drainage work have take place none the less can assure he that we will keep it within the pipeline of scheme that we be consider for future investment the previous government dodge vital infrastructure decision for year so be glad that this government be step up with project such as the east coast main line upgrade which have be announce today strengthen connection to leeds and west yorkshire however although connection to london be important anyone cross the pennines from leeds to manchester via town in my constituency will know that this route be in vital need of investment will the secretary of state assure my constituent that this will not be the last of the project that she announce and that the calder valley line upgrade be still very much on the table as have say there be number of very worthy rail scheme which although funding may not have be allocate during this spending review period be important to the travel public my hon friend make strong case for the scheme that will benefit his constituent and can assure he that when we have any update on future funding availability will come back and update the house the northern ireland minister for infrastructure inform this morning that her department be work with the department for transport and the european investment bank on the recommendation in the all island strategic rail review one of those recommendation be the opening of the antrim to lisburn line which include the opening of three previously close station at crumlin ballinderry and glenavy with new hall at the belfast international airport can the secretary of state provide any further update on what support the government can provide or what engagement she have have with the department of infrastructure in northern ireland or the european investment bank on what will be critical piece of investment in my constituency of south antrim although have not personally have any direct engagement it may be that the rail minister or my official have and so would be happy to write back to the hon gentleman to update he on any collaboration that be take place in this respect people across cumbria will warmly welcome the decision make by the secretary of state about the dualling of the pennine section of the which will benefit the whole county however wonder whether she might also say something about another scheme that be not yet at the same level of development which be the cumbria coastal line run from carlisle through my constituency to barrow and then on to lancaster other cumbrian colleague and have very productive meeting with the rail minister last week and wonder whether the secretary of state will help to push for the final business case to be invest in so that we can make some progress on the upgrade to that all important line my hon friend have speak to directly about this in the past couple of day know that the rail minister find that meet very helpful appreciate that there be some strategic crossover with defence and the department for energy security and net zero but will be sure to stay in touch with my hon friend as the business case develop the that run between welshpool and oswestry be key economic artery for the marches region but like the rest of north shropshire transport infrastructure it have be seriously neglect over many year that have leave the crossroad at llynclys in my constituency as one of the west midland bad accident blackspot highways england have great plan to redesign it and make it safe for all concerned will the secretary of state meet to see how we can progress that critical improvement would be very happy to ask my hon friend the minister for the future of roads to take that meeting as suspect that she will be close to some of the detail of the work that national highways be do welcome today announcement that will see improvement in the performance on the west coast main line particularly as they come during the week where in my constituency and in many other we celebrate crewe day which commemorate the anniversary almost year ago when the first rail service pass through the now strategic rail hub of crewe but can the secretary of state outline how this funding will be use to ensure that freight growth target can be meet on the west coast corridor and tell we whether new route such as the midland north west rail link be be consider to support this ambition shall write to my hon friend about the detail of the midland north west rail link as we establish great british railways we will be place duty on the new organisation which will be the publicly own organisation to bring together the management of track and train to increase the amount of freight that we transport on the railway we do need to get lorry off the road and move more good on the rail network it be strategic objective for and my department to make sure that we be maximise the amount of freight that we can transport on the rail network while also deliver excellent passenger service the secretary of state and the minister for the future of roads will be surprised that be go to break the habit of lifetime and not talk about the gateshead flyover for change but be very interested in the structure fund and look forward to engage far with the department on how we can deliver this vital infrastructure for gateshead instead of the flyover want to talk about the delivery of the signal system for the metro slightly less exciting for some perhaps but it be incredibly important that come on top of new train and billion of investment include in new metro line do the secretary of state agree that investment in the north east be be deliver because we have labour mayor in kim mcguinness work with labour mp and labour government agree mayor kim mcguinness be fearsome advocate for her region the first day meet she she manage to mention to the tyne bridge nexus signal and extend the metro out to washington all in about second be really pleased that we be deliver these vital improvement to transport infrastructure for his constituent and the wide region thank the secretary of state for her statement and the minister for the future of roads for her generous engagement with regard the expansion of the in derby which have be greenlit today many resident and business will welcome the expansion of the which be significant bottleneck it also mean we now have the opportunity to unlock economic growth around that stretch of road however some resident be rightly concerned about the impact of the road on establish woodland and markeaton park how much biodiversity net gain will be deliver through the project and will it be use to drive improvement in public transport walk and cycling finally can she ensure that this development have no effect whatsoever on the unesco world heritage status of the derwent valley would expect all road scheme that we be announce today to contribute to our public transport objective and improve the walk and cycling environment as say in my statement road be use by everyone and for many different mode of transport on my hon friend point about biodiversity net gain be assure that all scheme have go through very thorough environmental assessment will write to he on the other issue he raise call markus campbell savours to ask the final question like many cumbrians be delighted and relieve that the government have agree funding for the trans pennine project it never should have be in doubt and it be clear to that it would not have be be it not for the financial legacy of the previous government minister can now look forward to lobby for new roundabout at brigham and broughton in west cumbria project reject by the previous government can the secretary of state set out what assessment she have make of the benefit to my constituent of the trans pennine project last but not least madam deputy speaker the be vital scheme that will not only reduce journey time but improve safety unlock the delivery of new home in some location and open up access to the region beautiful national park the work never stop in this job so note what my hon friend say about his campaign for new roundabout and look forward to discuss that with he in the future on point of order madam deputy speaker in my year in this house it have always be the practice that statement of this nature would be make alongside white paper which would be available in the vote office to members as soon as the secretary of state sit down there be no white paper in the vote office to explain the detail of the government decision making be there anything you can do to elucidate from the secretary of state whether white paper will be forthcoming and when that will be thank the hon gentleman for his point of order that be not matter for the chair but be sure the secretary of state will have hear his comment post office horizon inquiry volume sir wyn williams have today release the first volume of his report into the horizon scandal which cause so much harm to so many innocent people the fearless and diligent work of his inquiry have believe win the trust and admiration of postmaster the inquiry have ask penetrate question of large number of witness and have scrutinise more than million page of evidence know that the whole house recognise the bravery of the postmaster who fight against enormous odd to see their cause recognise sir wyn report remind we that blameless people be impoverished bankrupt stress beyond belief and lose their job marriage reputation mental health and in some case their life be sure that the whole house share my gratitude to sir wyn and his team for their work so far this be only the first volume of their final report spell out the scandal human impact and look at the redress scheme that have be put in place in response the second volume will in due course deal with the cause of the scandal and how repetition can be avoid to be clear be very sympathetic to sir wyn recommendation in the volume publish today clearly number of they require careful consideration we will respond to they promptly as some concern the ongoing delivery of horizon redress scheme sir wyn have set we deadline of october and we will meet it the house will see that sir wyn have accept that the post office the department and ministers continue to adhere to the aim of provide financial redress which be full fair and prompt he also conclude that the majority of people who have accept offer under the group litigation order scheme will have do so because for they the offer be full and fair that say sir wyn make some understandable criticism especially of the horizon shortfall scheme which we will need to study closely and address we inherit compensation process that be widely see as too slow adversarial and legalistic well over four year after the first high court case expose the scandal only postmaster have have final settlement there be clearly significant gap in the compensation process and many victim have not come forward indeed there be no compensation scheme in place for those postmaster whose conviction have be overturn by parliament year ago the government have pay million in redress we have now quadruple that to nearly billion we have launch compensation scheme for postmaster who have have their conviction overturn the horizon conviction redress scheme and have merge the post office compensation arrangement for overturn conviction into it through the post office we have deliver fix sum offer to over victim who opt for it we have also launch an independent process to allow people to appeal their hss settlement or offer that should provide as sir wyn say in his report an opportunity to put right any failure to deliver redress which be full and fair for hss victim we have also begin discussion with fujitsu on their contribution to the cost of the scandal as the house know and as sir wyn report underline there be still lot more to do know that the postmaster who have yet to agree final compensation be frustrate with the delay so be we have consult regularly with the horizon compensation advisory board and other on what more we can do to improve redress sir wyn recommendation be very helpful in that regard two of his recommendation address issue that we have already be work on across government and with the advisory board can confirm that we accept sir wyn recommendation that claimant should be able to bank the good offer that they get from the glo process and that it should not be put at risk if they choose to go to the independent panel secondly we will provide redress for family member of postmaster who suffer because of the scandal have meet the group lost chances for the child of sub postmaster which have campaign with considerable courage on this issue sir wyn rightly recognise that design suitable compensation scheme for family member raise some very difficult issue none the less we want to look after those family member who suffer most meet sir wyn recommendation that we should give redress to close family member of those most adversely affect by horizon give those challenge we will now discuss the detail of how scheme should be run with claimant lawyer the independent advisory board and the lost chances group it will be open to close family member of exist horizon claimant who themselves suffer personal injury include psychological distress because of their relative suffer other than in exceptional circumstance we will need contemporaneous write evidence of that personal injury there be some fundamental lesson to be learn to which sir wyn point about how compensation follow wrongdoing on this scale should be deliver in future in particular the post office should never have be allow to run it decision on funding should have be make much more quickly and it should not have need an itv drama to stimulate action to overturn hundred of unjust conviction we can not now turn back the clock to fix those fundamental mistake we must instead address two challenge the first challenge be to make sure that if there be ever another terrible scandal like this one we all sincerely hope there be not the victim do not need to bring traumatic court case to expose it the second challenge if another such scandal happen be that the government must be set up to offer trust redress from the very start sir wyn argue that there should be stand public body to deliver redress in any further scandal have considerable amount of sympathy with that argument but clearly we need to analyse the option fully before we commit to it we will reflect on how to address those twin challenge and will bring back our conclusion to the house we can never properly recompense person for be wrongly deny their freedom for the humiliation of be wrongly accuse or for see their love one in profound distress or bad and neither can we recompense they for their good reputation be take from they can not assuage the anger of the victim nor will the anger that feel on their behalf ever be assuage but we be determined to do more on redress and beyond and to do it quickly to give more of the victim of this appalling scandal at least measure of the peace that they so rightly deserve commend sir wyn report to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement we welcome the release of volume of the post office horizon inquiry final report and put on record my thank to sir wyn williams and the inquiry team for all the work that they have do alongside all those who give evidence this inquiry lay bare one of the great miscarriage of justice in modern british history volume focus on redress and the human impact of the horizon scandal which have be evolve since the human impact be particularly devastating with the report reveal that at least people may have take their own life as result of the post office horizon it scandal it also recognise that family member have also suffer from this miscarriage of justice even though as the minister say we can never recompense person properly for this miscarriage be sure the whole house will want to ensure that the victim be fully compensate by the scheme and would like to put on the record my tribute to the work of my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who set up this process of redress the report have recommend that the government the department and where appropriate the post office and fujitsu shall provide write response to sir wyn recommendation by october can the minister confirm that the government will be able to say by october whether they will accept all of the report recommendation the report detail that there be still much to be do to ensure justice for the victim so who and how will those responsible be hold answerable for the year of denial and suffering this be not simply technical failure it be failure of oversight governance and accountability the report find that the post office and fujitsu know or at the very least they should have know that the horizon it system have fault the sub postmaster be also describe as victim of wholly unacceptable behaviour by the two company sir wyn have state that there be still more than claim to resolve and that there have be egregious delay in compensation will the minister therefore update the house on the most recent status of the compensation scheme what step be he take to address these concern and how be the government ensure that full fair and fast compensation be deliver without further bureaucracy or delay will the minister update we on what action be be take in relation to fujitsu which be still be award government contract fujitsu say that it would wait until the inquiry report to offer compensation so will the minister confirm that there be now nothing prevent fujitsu from pay interim compensation will he also confirm that it will be make clear how much he believe fujitsu should contribute to the redress scheme in the spending review the government allocate million from its transformation fund for the post office specifically earmark to support investment plan include replace the exist horizon computer system will the minister update the house on the progress of secure new computer system for the post office and whether that system will replace the horizon system in its entirety what assessment have he make of the early capture accounting software and its legacy of problem finally to move on from this protract miscarriage will the minister confirm when we will see the much anticipated green paper on the future of the post office network and how the public can have their say on that consultation the time for half measure be over justice delay be justice deny and those affect by this scandal deserve nothing less than the full force of the government commitment to truth reform and redress taxpayer also deserve to know how much minister think fujitsu should pay to resolve these terrible wrong thank the hon lady for her comment and question she be right to say in her opening remark about this be the great miscarriage of justice in our country history the responsibility be therefore on we all to do everything we can to make sure the victim receive full and fair compensation and to ensure that there be never repeat the hon lady specifically challenge on the question of the october deadline that sir wyn williams have put in place can confirm that we be determined to meet that deadline it be particularly important that we do so as some of his recommendation concern the ongoing delivery of the horizon compensation scheme and we do not want inadvertently or not to delay or hold back any of those claim the hon lady rightly give the opportunity to again pay tribute to the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake for his work when he be the post office minister without question we would be even far behind without the considerable amount of work and effort that he put in there be many other in the house who have campaign long and hard on behalf of the sub postmaster include the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis who see in his place and my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne who chair the business and trade committee the hon lady ask who and how will those responsible be hold to account she know that sir wyn williams be due to publish the second part of his report which focus on those very question we will consider carefully what he have to say about that when we receive his report suspect that she already know that the metropolitan police be lead an investigation into whether criminal responsibility be at play more than police officer be work on that investigation and they have identify number of individual of interest we will see what they do with regard to those individual in due course as the hon lady and the house will understand ministers be not in any way involve in such decision what further step have we take to deliver and speed up compensation the hon lady will be aware that we have issue the opportunity for sub postmaster who apply to the horizon shortfall scheme and who want to accept fix sum payment of to do so we have put in place an appeal process to try to give those who feel they have not receive fair offer to date chance to get full and fair redress there be particular challenge in the horizon shortfall scheme if be honest it be the scheme that worry about the most not least because there be case in which there do not appear to be any evidence of shortfall that do not mean that there be no shortfall it mean that at this stage we do not have evidence of what those shortfall be as the house would expect have go back to the post office and make it clear that we want it to reinvestigate to see whether evidence can be find in as many of those case as possible we be look very carefully at what we can do about the rest on fujitsu we will need to see sir wyn final report to understand fully the degree of fujitsu culpability have make it clear to fujitsu that we think it should bring forward an interim compensation payment and hope that it will see the report today and recognise the need to do that the hon lady also ask about the green paper we hope to publish it very shortly one of the issue that it will consider be the future of the post office it system because we certainly need to move on from the past and horizon we will set out in bit more detail at that point what work we be do in that regard call the chair of the select committee on behalf of our committee welcome this report from sir wyn williams as jo hamilton have say it unmask the full horror of what be do to the sub postmaster include the truth that at least suicide result from what the post office do to innocent people sir wyn williams echo almost all the recommendation our committee have now make three time to ministers there be claim still outstanding and there be in sir wyn word egregious delay at every stage of the claim process so do the minister now accept that as we have recommend and sir wyn have recommend up front legal advice need to be provide to victim do the minister also accept that we must now once and for all strip the post office of any role in the horizon shortfall scheme will the minister commit to date for get rid of the post office altogether from that redress scheme today report make it clear that at least people in the post office know exactly what be go on and some of they come to this house and mislead member of this house not once but twice so be it now the moment for we to commence contempt of parliament proceeding against the leader of the post office who mislead we so badly want to take this opportunity again to pay tribute to the work of the business and trade committee under my right hon friend chairmanship as he have say there have be series of recommendation from his committee and recognise that we have not always agree with all those recommendation for the question about whether to offer legal advice to horizon shortfall scheme claimant have always be finely balanced judgment say that because it have always be clear that the victim want fast route to secure compensation without the involvement of lawyer and the fact that so many have accept the fix sum payment be an indication of that appetite nevertheless recognise that sir wyn williams have give we clear steer on that particular question and we will consider that extremely carefully and very quickly on the question of whether the post office should be strip completely of responsibility for the horizon shortfall scheme there be no doubt that if we be start afresh the post office would have no responsibility for any of the compensation scheme when look at the question of whether to start over again in the delivery of the compensation scheme and at who should be responsible for their delivery recognise that to change completely the process as they have be set up would see further delay in get compensation to the victim say gently to my right hon friend that sir wyn williams have not say today that the post office should not be involve in the horizon shortfall scheme delivery we have be clear that we need to take away responsibility for the most complex case and we have set up the appeal scheme to do so give the number who have come forward with appeal on the horizon shortfall scheme hope that we will be able to give confidence to those people that they will have chance to get full and fair redress call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for give advance sight of his statement the horizon scandal be an appalling miscarriage of justice and today report highlight the extent of the human suffering that it have cause read the story of some of the victim in this report be truly heartbreaking and it could not be clear that far too many people life have be irreparably affect no scandal of this kind can be allow to happen ever again we warmly welcome the publication of the first volume of the independent inquiry report which have the full support of the liberal democrats and sincerely hope that it will focus ministers mind in get victim the compensation and justice that they deserve as soon as possible it be shocking that victim of this scandal have have to wait this long for their rightful compensation and justice the government need to move at speed and bring an end to this unacceptable delay although we welcome the promise of full compensation the liberal democrats will continue to hold the government to account in order to ensure that victim get the payment they deserve as quickly as possible so will the minister confirm that the government will implement the recommendation of today report in full will they set out timeline for when all victim can expect to receive full and fair compensation what conversation have the government have with the post office and fujitsu about restorative justice in the light of sir wyn recommendation lastly when will the government finally introduce legislation on full duty of candour for which sub postmaster and the victim of so many other scandal and disaster have so long call welcome the hon lady comment and welcome the challenge to the government to go far and fast on deliver compensation not just from she and her party but from across the house she ask similar question to that from the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin who speak for the official opposition on whether we would accept the recommendation that sir wyn have set out today as make clear in my opening remark we be very sympathetic to all his recommendation indeed be able to confirm today that we have accept two of his recommendation to provide compensation for family member and to move on the question of the good offer hope that give the house confidence that we will meet the deadline that sir wyn williams have impose on we the hon member for richmond park sarah olney rightly join all side of the house in challenge fujitsu to recognise its responsibility hope it will read sir wyn report and conclusion afresh and recognise that it now need to make an interim payment restorative justice be one of the significant recommendation in sir wyn list and we will consider that very carefully there be series of option as to how one might deliver restorative justice and there would clearly need to be consultation with the victim we will think through the different step that we need to take in that regard add my support for the introduction of redress scheme for close family member on the business and trade committee and in my constituency surgery have hear from family member and it be clear that the trauma of this injustice have be pass down through generation can the minister share any further detail on how he expect the scheme to operate and more importantly who will be responsible for oversee the scheme and any action take in regard to family affect by the capture system welcome my hon friend work on the business and trade committee and more generally in push the government to do more on full and fair compensation on the question of family member sir wyn make it clear in his report not only that offer compensation scheme for family member be the right thing to do but that there will be significant design challenge in how such scheme be put together we will work with the independent horizon compensation advisory board with claimant lawyer and with the campaign group lost chances on the design of such scheme my hon friend briefly mention capture as do the hon member for west worcestershire we be in the process of work with number of the victim of the capture scandal and their legal representative to design an effective compensation process for they there be again some significant challenge around the availability of evidence give that the use of the capture software be before the introduction of the horizon computer system and so the amount of evidence available be significantly less none the less we be work at pace on the design of such scheme as member of the business and trade committee be aghast to find that the capture system predate horizon and go as far back as so we be year on the minister have touch on the difficulty of get evidence from that time have he make any assessment of how many victim might be involve in this capture scheme it look as though it might be burgeon scandal on the scale of the horizon scheme thank the hon gentleman for his work on the business and trade committee too he give the opportunity to pay tribute to the noble lord beamish who campaign for considerable period of time to bring the house attention to the issue of capture sub postmaster no definitive number exist of how many post office branch use capture there be rough estimate that some of all post office agency branch roughly between and use capture before the horizon system be roll out in give the lack of evidence we be very much try to learn the lesson from some of the horizon compensation scheme in the way in which we design the capture scheme we will take forward case almost as pilot process and will take stock at the end of that process to see what further work and further tweak to the design of the scheme we need to make so that we can deliver fair redress to all those victim of the post office scandal too sir wyn rightly highlight the role fujitsu must play in restorative justice remind the shadow minister the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin and the house that ask the previous government to pause and review all fujitsu contract which they refuse to do thank the minister for all his work on the matter and for the meeting he have kindly have with do he agree with and sir wyn that it be time that fujitsu contribute to the compensation and that it be also time we stop the billion of pound of government contract that it continue to be award include its bid for hmrc trader support service which be worth million alone look forward to response from the minister office to the letter send he highlight this yesterday my hon friend have be one of those who campaign consistently over long period of time for justice for sub postmaster in particular for her constituent chris head hope he and she will recognise that one of the recommendation in sir wyn report that we confirm today we will accept be in no small part due to mr head and her campaign on that particular question my hon friend be absolutely right that there be moral obligation on fujitsu to contribute to the cost of the scandal that have be clear for long time welcome the fact that fujitsu have acknowledge that and have begin discussion with the government sir wyn report today far underline the case for fujitsu to make an interim payment towards the cost of the scandal on her point more generally about the role of fujitsu there be no question but that fujitsu want to move out of responsibility for the horizon system and suspect we all want fujitsu to move out of work with the post office none the less we need fujitsu at the moment to continue to maintain the horizon system which be key to the work of post office branch up and down the country in all our community while we work at pace to put in place well system go forward this minister well know that across the house many colleague for year now have raise deep concern about what happen raise it myself on june october april and december many colleague year and year ago be cite the monstrous injustice and grotesque breach of human right and civil liberty of our fellow citizen but it take the itv drama of january for the earth to move that rather beg the question what be the point of parliament and its elect representative be it not about time that the institution of the state get out the handcuff and hold the tax fund villain who perpetrate this monstrous injustice to full and total account commend the right hon gentleman for his campaigning on this issue know that he have continue to push different government and different post office ministers on the issue around this scandal and have no doubt that he will continue to do so he be absolutely right that the people responsible for this scandal need to be hold to account sir wyn further report will lay bare who be responsible and the work of the police be ongoing as say early police officer be work on this case they be in touch with sub postmaster representative and have identify series of people who be of interest to their inquiry as he will understand ministers be rightly not involve in those specific discussion but we be watch with great interest the progress of that police inquiry we will certainly look to act on the recommendation that sir wyn make when the final part of his report come out thank the minister for his statement this scandal be sorry chapter in our country history and hope that those who be affect be compensate quickly and fairly be sure the minister will know that this scandal disproportionately affect people from black asian and minority ethnic background of those who be prosecute be from bme background but do not feel the report recognise the sensitivity recognise that the report can not address every single angle but feel that the way bme people be affect disproportionately could have be highlight more what will he do to address the disparity as he move forward in address this scandal my hon friend raise significant issue and one that have no doubt have bearing on the way in which the scandal unfold she will understand that for formal view on who be responsible and what go wrong we need to wait for the final report from sir wyn williams but it be quite clear that significant number of sub postmaster from an ethnic minority be still wait for compensation as indeed generally significant number of postmaster be wait for compensation we need to ensure that all those from an ethnic minority receive compensation as equally we must give priority to every single person who have yet to receive compensation the government have be tell routinely by organisation such as scottish postmasters for justice and redress that compensation for victim of the horizon scandal be take too long and that the application process be akin to the trauma of second trial for victim we have also hear today that sir wyn williams report illustrate that victim continue to face an unnecessarily adversarial attitude from the post office and that the uk government continue to drag their foot in offer full and swift redress give that the minister previously stand at the dispatch box and say that justice delay be justice report december vol and give the human toll of the scandal reveal today will this government finally and immediately end these obstructive process so that redress can be tackle straight on without wait for the second volume there be no question but that the compensation process have take far too long the scandal could have be stop lot early everybody who be victim of the scandal should have have compensation certainly by the time we take office have say that we have set out to speed up the delivery of compensation we have quadruple the amount of compensation pay out to victim of the scandal we have move at pace to plug some of the obvious gap in the compensation process completely accept the challenge make by the hon gentleman by other across the house and indeed by sub postmaster who have yet to receive compensation that there be still lot more to do thank the minister for his statement and for his powerful word but the publication of the report confirm the heartbreaking scale of the human impact of this shocking miscarriage of justice the concealment and cover up of the horizon scandal follow familiar pattern institution deceive and distort because they put their reputation before truth and justice as we have see before in the infected blood scandal the nuclear test veteran scandal and of course the hillsborough disaster among many other the law that bear that disaster name would end the culture of cover up that we have hear about today do the minister agree that the report show why the government must honour their pledge and promise to enact the hillsborough law in full and end the culture of cover up which do so much damage to the innocent victim and their family and to the country reputation have absolutely no doubt that we need to see in full who be responsible for this disaster and why sir wyn williams work on that be critical we await his final report which will look at what happen why and who be responsible that transparency will be hugely important to help the post office and the country as whole to learn lesson from this appalling scandal if we need to introduce measure to ensure that the post office be never in such position again we will certainly look to bring they forward the post office horizon scandal have often be compare with the contaminated blood disaster by coincidence this very afternoon the relevant all party parliamentary group lead by the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford have be have meeting with the infected blood compensation authority even if the minister do not go all the way with sir wyn williams suggestion that there might be stand body responsible for deliver compensation will the government look at the experience of the compensation body for that scandal rather than allow separate disaster to be compensate for in separate stovepipe arrangement to be clear sir wyn williams recommendation of stand body to deliver compensation be very much to ensure that if there be ever future disaster on this scale and we all hope that there be not the government be well set up to respond to it he have not specifically suggest that we transfer into such body the responsibility for the delivery of compensation scheme at this stage because do so would undoubtedly slow down the process think that there be parallel with the infected blood inquiry but there be also difference we need to learn lesson on the delivery of compensation from the infected blood scandal the post office scandal and other scandal that come before in that regard the national audit office publish important work last summer which will certainly help to inform our judgment about the case for such stand body associate myself with the comment of the chair of the business and trade committee my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne about the involvement of the post office hope the minister have check and balance in place to test what information it provide because it clearly can not be trust my question be about fujitsu which stay quiet while sub postmaster include former constituent of mine go to prison the minister say that the government be in negotiation with fujitsu which sound like fujitsu will not pay the compensation that it should will he say more about who will be the final arbiter in determine how much fujitsu should pay in this scandal which it be fundamentally at the root of take this opportunity to commend my hon friend for his consistent campaigning on this issue he be absolutely right to underline the moral responsibility that fujitsu have to contribute to the cost of the scandal welcome the fact that fujitsu have accept that it have such moral obligation have make it clear to fujitsu that think it should bring forward an interim payment and discussion with it have begin as say but it will be important that we receive the final report from sir wyn williams to understand properly the scale of fujitsu responsibility go forward as compare with the responsibility of other player in this appalling scandal be absolutely clear that fujitsu do have clear responsibility it could begin to act now and hope that it do so constituent who have be represent for two year be unfairly dismiss as result of the horizon scandal appreciate the effort that the minister and his predecessor have put into this matter the report make it absolutely clear that the compensation system be too cumbersome and complicated for many people and the government have say that they will do everything they can to speed it up but some people be wait not only for compensation but for recognition of the injustice that be do to they what will the minister do to reassure those people and work on their behalf to get they the recognition that will lead to compensation the hon lady make an important and significant point and give the opportunity to comment on that particular constituency case which she and have discuss couple of time she be absolutely right when she allude to the fact that there be victim of the scandal who have not yet come forward or perhaps for number of reason put in compensation claim hope that the publication of sir wyn report and his comment the criticism and challenge to the government on go far as well as the reassurance that he have offer will give those who have not yet put in claim the confidence to do so on the specific case that she know very well and have discuss with be determined to move forward have take number of step to do so and will come back to she the minister plainly agree that this injustice have go on too long early today speak to janet skinner one of the postmaster whose life be wreck in when she serve nine month in prison after wrongful conviction she have spend year since then struggle to get compensation and be still battle for it now force to wade through endless paperwork and cruel bureaucratic maze in her own word the compensation process have be hard than anything ve ever have to do before and ve be to prison that be what she say to today sir wyn report be welcome hope it ignite fire under the minister although know that he be committed to solve problem like janet in month not year can he give the undertaking that he will solve these problem in month not year on the right hon gentleman direct challenge certainly want to do that completely share his view that every victim who still have not have compensation have wait too long and that in particular and the whole house have responsibility to keep up the pressure to get full and fair compensation for those victim as quickly as possible the right hon gentleman will recognise that we have make some progress in the last month we have quadruple the amount of compensation that have be pay out and set up new compensation scheme to begin to address some of the obvious gap however completely accept the challenge that he and perhaps janet skinner pose that we need to go far and fast also welcome sir wyn report it remind we of the cynical dishonest and illegal behaviour of post office and fujitsu official who cause so much misery to so many people who be do an honest job and be wrongly accuse the minister rightly say that he be determined to move on and get redress for those victim but as long as post office official have anything to do with this compensation scheme believe that his honest aim will be thwart last week meet with four postmaster in northern ireland who tell that despite request for documentation some date back to january it be still not forthcoming it be be drip fed which mean that when new information be seek they go back to the beginning of the day period even when forensic economist have look at their claim in some case they be discount by up to can only say that those be obstructionist tactic as long as those who still believe that they do nothing wrong be in charge we will not achieve the objective of quick redress recognise and understand why there be considerable scepticism across the house about the post office continue to have any role in the delivery of any part of the compensation process as say when first come into this role look very carefully at whether we should essentially start over and take the post office out of the compensation process be persuade that if we do that we would significantly delay still far the delivery of compensation to the victim sir wyn williams make similar point today while make series of recommendation to government to go far and fast in particular on the horizon shortfall scheme as have allude to be extremely sympathetic to his recommendation there be some that we need to look at in more detail before come back to the house and particularly to sir wyn the right hon gentleman reference conversation that he have have with number of sub postmaster in his constituency or in northern ireland more generally if he want to bring those case to my attention outside this session would be very happy to look at they point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker wish to make brief point of order follow the sad death of lord norman tebbit last night feel particularly touch by it because serve with he in parliament between and and suppose be one of the last thatcherites leave stand here to we he be an icon of everything we believe in about small government and deregulation he be the original brexiteer and the original campaigner against woke he have an extraordinary ability with word he come from humble background and sum up everything that we believe in by pull himself up and achieve greatness do not want to end on political note what really want to end on be personal note know that he have reputation as hard hit politician but above all he be supremely kind man he be kind to we young member of parliament when mrs thatcher resign remember sit in the tea room and ask he if he would stand as leader of the conservative party to my regret he feel that he could not the reason why be those awful event in the bombing of the grand hotel in he show tremendous courage and stoicism above all although he lead our party to victory as chairman in the election he refuse high office because he want to look after his wife margaret he devote his whole life to she in term of love and devotion as after those terrible event she be in wheelchair for the rest of her life it be great honour and delight in this short point of order to pay tribute to my friend lord norman tebbit thank the right hon gentleman for his touching tribute which be now on the record far to that point of order madam deputy speaker start work as special adviser to norman tebbit in the department of trade and industry on the monday morning after the brighton bomb for those first few week go to visit he with member of his private office in stoke mandeville hospital the reason why he be in that specialist unit be that while he be badly injure he want to be nearby to his wife my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh be completely right he give tremendous service to this country but he feel that his first duty have to be to look after his wife it be terrific loss to my party and to the country when he feel that he be no long able to serve in government because of the need to care for margaret have that not happen he might well have become prime minister he be remarkable person whom we will miss greatly be delighted that my right hon friend have help to put his service on the record thank the right hon gentleman for his touching tribute far to that point of order madam deputy speaker meet lord tebbit only shortly after he have step down from this house but even at that stage of his career he still have the inherent kindness and commitment to come to my constituency to support relatively new member of this house courage and commitment really be what encapsulate his character he prove that when serve his country in the inherently dangerous role of royal air force pilot and he prove it far in achieve something that prime ministers alone might have fail to have achieve in tackle the abuse of trade union power by unrepresentative militant trade union be much more representative of their membership today thank to what he do as we have hear lord tebbit prove his courage and commitment finally in his devotion to his wife who be grievously injure as result of terrorist campaign the aftermath of which our legal system to this very day still find difficult to cope with altogether he serve his country magnificently and he be role model of integrity and courage that people can admire even if they do not necessarily subscribe to everything in which he believe and for which he campaign thank all right hon member for their touching tribute special educational needs and disabilities training in schools motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about the evaluation of training about special educational need and disability in initial teacher education to require training about special education need and disability for certain person work in school as part of their continue professional development and for connected purpose may first remark on how touch the tribute we just hear be every child deserve an inclusive education in an environment that enable they to thrive every child should have teacher and support staff who understand their need and have the professional capacity and skill to care for and teach each child propose this bill because sadly that be not the experience of many child with special educational need live in my constituency child in barking and dagenham have be let down because the national send system be break across the country parent feel hopeless and teacher be overwhelmed last night my constituency neighbour and hon friend the member for dagenham and rainham margaret mullane secure an important debate in this house on send she highlight that request for education health and care plan in barking and dagenham double in an increase that be four time the national average know that improve the life chance of child regardless of their background or need be central to the labour government mission however we can not achieve it without fix special educational need support as my bill set out require compulsory send training for teacher and teaching staff would provide they with the skill they need to educate our child initial teacher education and continued professional development programme have no dedicated send training send seminar and session be weave into the exist curriculum but fail to give teacher the expertise they need to support send child the depth and practical application of exist training be often too variable and many teacher feel underprepared teacher require professional expertise to effectively provide wraparound support for all child but be afraid child with send be instead force into an overstretched ehcp process manage by overburden local authority because mainstream school support have be strip away after year of conservative cut when visit school and meet parent in my constituency recently hold coffee morning attend by more than people hear the same thing over and over again early help make big difference early help can happen only with appropriately train teacher with the skill to identify child in need the evidence overwhelmingly show that ensure child receive speech and language support for example would reduce behavioural issue in child with send make mainstream set more successful for many child who might otherwise be exclude from school send child be five time more likely to be exclude and have some of the wide attainment gap of any demographic impact on earn potential and overall life chance it do not have to be that way with more than of student with an ehcp be in mainstream school the current system be let down child who have special educational need and disability school be try their good but the truth be that teacher feel ill equipped to provide support for child with send one teacher in barking and dagenham tell about the four hour training seminar on send that they attend but that be their only training follow by get on with it attitude from the education sector the lack of training mean that well mean teacher inevitably create an exclusive education environment result in nine out of child with send be leave behind this be two tier education system work against our child who have the great need early intervention must be at the core of the government send strategy but it will not be successful if it be leave only to special educational need co ordinator and teach assistant and this bill seek to address that for most school dedicated senco on the school senior leadership team be nice to have rather than must have parent certainly those have meet in my constituency be often leave wonder who they can turn to as they fight to get the support that their child deserve one parent in my constituency tell about the exhausting decade they have have fighting for an ehcp for their son who have autism after five year of school become too difficult challenge for her son once he start secondary school in her little boy be refer by the nhs to neurology it take until for doctor to confirm that he also have epilepsy which be cause brain seizure result in short absence the point here which the little boy mother make to be that her child be clearly struggle at school for year find it difficult to focus that be apparent before the year fight to secure an ehcp for her son which she only manage to do towards the end of his time at secondary school this little boy be in mainstream school for year be teach by teacher with inadequate send training his mother feel that teacher equip with well skill and training on send would have identify her child need soon and could have help he early send support for child be complicated picture that require input from different agency and parent must always be at the heart of any discussion or decision about send support for their child that be especially true for the many child who will and do fall short of the statutory duty to secure an ehcp with the lack of specialist support or training for teach staff in mainstream school those child be too often leave unsupported of course for some child access to specialist send school be the most appropriate fit however the majority of send child be in mainstream school we must therefore recognise that our school should fundamentally shift to be well equip to support child with send with teacher who be well train because send child deserve the opportunity to succeed in our mainstream school be good teacher or good at any of the profession that look after and teach our child take special kind of person the responsibility these people hold be great than their responsibility to any individual child they be help raise and educate the next generation in our community and shape our society society in which want everyone to thrive and to which want everyone to contribute include those with send this bill support teacher to do their job properly they deserve adequate training enable they to deliver the early help that child with send need ask hon member from across the house for their support for this bill so that we can begin to fix the broken send system in this country question put and agree to order that nesil caliskan anna dixon chris ward chris kane mr clive betts danny beales daniel francis dawn butler jen craft lloyd hatton and sarah

proceeding draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests it be privilege to speak on report for the countless fan who fill the stand week in and week out wear their club shirt with pride and keep our club alive come rain or shine put on the record my thank to all right hon and hon member for their contribution in committee and to everyone who have engage with the process outside of westminster for all the high talk of regulator quangos and corporate structure let we never forget that football in this country be not an industry dream up by official on neat powerpoint slide or excel spreadsheet but living tradition that be part of who we be and part of the fabric of our nation that be precisely why we must be so careful now because this bill well intentione though it may be risk replace one danger minority of reckless owner with another namely reckless political interference that risk the independence of sport this bill which want to tackle cowboy owner come from an incoherent government under investigation for appoint labour crony to be the new sheriff of football and from department that have see the whip resign since the last meeting of the bill committee we really be in the thick of it would the shadow minister like to join in thank the shadow secretary of state his right hon friend the member for daventry stuart andrew for first introduce legislation to this house that promote an independent football regulator interruption as the shadow secretary of state say from sedentary position you ve mess it all up and be sure that do not apply just to football before move on to our amendment it be worth remind ourselves how we get here english football be not invent by corporate lawyer or politician its origin be in the history and soul of community across our country it be the same spirit that today see parent across the country drive through wind and rain on sunday morning so that their child can run out in their local club colour it be spirit that do not appear on balance sheet but without sustainable finance there be no football at all sadly we have all see those case where financial mismanagement and reckless spending have see club and fan damage that be why the conservatives put fan first by launch the independent fan lead review of football governance which focus on the long term sustainability of the game we support well fan engagement respect the heritage of our club and strengthen ownership test to help prevent the issue we have see at the like of bury charlton and reading the fan lead review state that this area of regulation should in time be return to the football association and league have speak to many football fan across the country and also in my constituency can say with confidence that they would agree with that even more now that labour be try to directly interfere in english football by appoint labour crony during the passage of the bill we have hear from the fa and the premier league that they be concern by regulatory scope creep and we have seek in our amendment to push back on the tentacle of this socialist state seek to strangle with red tape our beautiful game this great british success story which attract million of fan around the world and contribute billion to our economy each season our amendment would prevent the secretary of state from expand the league in scope of the regulator under clause without the approval of parliament we must give club certainty and prevent whitehall empire building we must also have transparency about how much these new regulatory burden be cost club and ticket price both today and in the future that be why we have table amendment and every pound spend on new compliance staff be pound not spend on grassroots player stadium maintenance or affordable ticket price every new bureaucrat be another tenner on family matchday cost in the end the fan pick up the tab just like always the government impact assessment suggest that these cost will be more than million with small club expect bill of up to million we know that many small club will have no choice but to pass that cost on to fan and the government and their regulator must be honest about that member can help limit those additional cost by support our amendment and which would limit the size of the government new regulator and cap the pay of the chief executive at the same level as the prime minister the government state that they want their regulator to be light touch but they vote against limit be place upon it that lead to the question why be they say one thing while do the opposite in westminster be it because of inexperience or be the truth that this be yet another example of job for the boy to the cost of fan that be why we have table amendment that would limit political interference in the independence of sport we believe that fan should be consult on any political statement make by club football club must not be mouthpiece for whichever fashionable cause of the time and we believe that politic should be keep out of sport wherever possible when club speak it speak for its fan and the local community if it want to do that on matter far beyond football it should ask those fan first would the shadow minister mind tell the house what these fashionable cause that football club should not speak about be be happy to do so throughout committee stage we have be quite clear as the hon gentleman colleague the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson will say that we do not believe that that include the like of remembrance which we be differ from political cause however as we have say we do not believe that club should be get involve in politic and that be hill that we be willing to die on my amendment to schedule would remove the requirement for additional reporting on equality diversity and inclusion we all know that football must be welcome to everyone racism and bigotry have no place on the terrace just as they have no place in wide society football have make huge progress by itself with range of initiative already in the game include kick it out show racism the red card the premier league equality diversity and inclusion standard framework the english football league equality code of practice anti racism education and mentor scheme the game have do that not because government regulator tell it to but because it be right it work and fan support it however fan do not pay their hard earn money at the turnstile to fund diversity paperwork our amendment leave inclusion where it belong on the pitch in the stand and in the community let now turn to clause and to new clause in my name the new clause seek to ensure that the ifr exercise its function to avoid conflict with the regulation and rule of international footballe body fifa and uefa rule be clear national association must be free from undue political interference country that break that rule have be ban before just ask the greek football committee the government be sleepwalk towards giant own goal and this time there be no var to save we we already know that uefa have write to the secretary of state set out its concern about the bill and that the letter arrive after the government have introduce its expand version uefa write one particular area of concern stem from one of uefa fundamental requirement which be that there should be no government interference in the running of football unfortunately the minister could not give we enough reassurance about government interference with english football which be why have re table my amendment we know that uefa be concern about the potential for scope creep and that the government regulator may expand its mandate beyond its loosely define current competency such an expansion intentional or otherwise into broad aspect of football governance could undermine the establish structure and process of the sport and amount to government interference do not whether the shadow minister can get some help from his right hon friend the member for daventry who be sit next to he on the front bench wonder whether when the right hon gentleman be in the government he receive any correspondence from uefa and fifa give the openness that the shadow minister be call for will he now publish any correspondence receive by the last government that be quite rehearsed line that the hon gentleman be see to play out as we hear in committee the minister have seek to reassure the house that uefa have no problem with the bill if that be the case why be the letter not be lay in the house so that all member can vote with full confidence in what be be say what be be brief to the press differ significantly from what the minister be tell members today so far the minister have refuse to allow parliament to see that letter so that we can scrutinise the bill properly in the full possible way and in the proper context let will ask she again now what be she so afraid of be she scared that give the secretary of state be already under investigation for appoint one of her donor as chair the publication of the letter will prove to be yet another nail in the coffin of her regulator let now turn to schedule any regulator must be credible and that mean independent beyond any doubt but what have we see preferred chair with hidden political donation secretary of state force to recuse herself only when expose and revolving door will the hon gentleman give way will give way happily be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way give that he have name may ask he why the previous government include his colleague the shadow secretary of state who be sit next to he and who be the minister responsible at the time actively headhunte the individual in question and add he to the shortlist interruption they can shake their head all they like but that be true the secretary of state have either deliberately or not deliberately just mislead the house the gentleman in let explain the gentleman in question have already say order understand that the shadow minister may not have mean to say that the secretary of state have deliberately mislead the house he may want to clarify that will reflect on that comment madam deputy and withdraw it interruption have say that withdraw it do not know what the problem be member can scream and shout all they want but the reality be that in the select committee the chair in question say very clearly that he have be approach by civil servant not by the then minister in question the minister in question my right hon friend the member for daventry stuart andrew have already say on the floor of the house that he do not approach the say gentleman perhaps the secretary of state would also like to reflect on her comment there be revolving door of vest interest ready to leap in we would not let the chairman of rival you be already under investigation be not sure you want to make it bad we would not let the chairman of rival club referee cup final so why let order be sure the shadow minister do not mean to infer that be under investigation of course madam deputy speaker apologise you be not under investigation but the secretary of state and the government be that be matter of public record we would not let the chairman of rival club referee cup final so why would we let people with political or commercial conflict of interest sit at the very top of this new football referee my amendment to schedule be basic due diligence they would mean no party hack in the chair and full declaration of conflict of interest to avoid the mess that this government have get themselves into amendment would put stop to the cronyism once and for all and give the public proper transparency it be not radical it be responsible if we do not accept it the regulator will fail before the first whistle blow we have re table new clause that we still believe would strengthen the bill let begin with the welfare of player past and present who run on to the pitch every weekend and give we great entertainment we can not ignore the fact that for too long the welfare of player have too often be an afterthought once the final whistle blow and the crowd go home new clause call for the secretary of state to conduct within one year of this bill pass serious review of how we can well protect player past present and future the new clause do not dictate solution it demand serious evidence lead review it ask the secretary of state to bring together the govern body medical expert club and player to ensure that the beautiful game do not come at the cost of the mind and body of those who play it we hope the government listen last but certainly not least our new clause would require the government to consult on call full time on the two tier approach to football fan the alcohol ban which have be in place since be introduce to help curb hooliganism on the terrace during the problematic era of british football forty year on and with the modern game enjoy more family friendly atmosphere in stadium across the country club fan and the conservatives be urge the government to consult on lift the ban on alcohol as football fan know the legacy ban see fan rush to drink their beer before kick off and at half time this often lead to fan be delay on enter stadium and to overcrowd on concourse we have listen to club and fan especially those low down the football pyramid and urge the government to end the two tier approach to football fan as part of this bill new clause have support across this house and we hope it will be support today we be all here today because we care about english football but there be fundamental difference between we on the opposition benches who want the bill to be deliver in light touch way and the government heavy handed political regulator stand here today because want to see football succeed not nationalise by stealth we want club to be safeguard from dodgy owner but not strangle in red tape we want fan to have real say not tick off on form bury in filing cabinet we want inclusion that work not paperwork that gather dust above all we want football to remain what it have always be something build by the people and for the people not the political class good regulation can help the referee to blow the whistle when rule be break but it should not dictate every pass every tackle and every free kick the amendment in my name seek to limit the damage cause by this bill they park the bus against political overreach and let football play on if like hon and right hon member really love football the muddy pitch the terrace and the song that never change by all mean blow the whistle on the bad owner however we must also call time on ministers who think they can well run league from westminster football do not belong to the government it belong to the people who stand shoulder to shoulder in the stand win or lose let we do right by they today be pleased to be respond on report as the football governance bill enter its final stage in the house of commons begin by send my condolence to the family of liverpool diogo jota who tragically lose his life last week at just year of age alongside his brother be sure the whole house will join in send our thought to their love one english football be one of our proud tradition it be more than just game football bring we together provide source of local pride and unite we in victory and in loss the premier league the efl and the national league attract some of the good player in the world in return we find fan of english football club in almost every country however despite the global success story of english football there be underlying fragility in the game and this labour government be commit to tackle they as we be the party on the side of football fan we have see too many instance of irresponsible owner unsustainable financial model and inadequate regulation cast shadow over too many club as fan of bury derby county and countless other know all too well the current issue at sheffield wednesday and morecambe need resolve now and they demonstrate the urgent need for this bill to become law this change have be long time come date back in this place to the cross party culture media and sport committee report of the ill fat super league attempt lead of course to the fan lead review and take this opportunity to pay tribute to dame tracey crouch who pioneer that work my hon friend mention that conservative minister and tory members basically write the vast majority of this bill but then they decide to vote against it be confused about that but could she explain to why they think this be socialist bill and that football be be nationalise think it be absolutely ridiculous my hon friend make very good point hope that whoever win the election on july will see this as good bill to crack on with because it be important for the future of football and crucially for the future of football fan official report football governance public bill committee may those be not my word but the word of the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew for whom have huge respect and affection that bring on to the point make by the shadow minister the hon member for old bexley and sidcup mr french and the amendment stand in his name amendment be on the issue of list in primary legislation the competition in scope of regulation the approach in this bill be consistent with similar sport legislation the opposition amendment would be likely to make this hybrid bill which would mean year of delay in effect kill off the bill that they introduce and which be in their manifesto we have be absolutely clear that the regulator will be operationally independent of government it will not exert any influence on the football association autonomy to govern the game the shadow minister be obsess with the publication of private communication with uefa and fifa despite his obsession and what would say be his quite strong remark about at the dispatch box do his government publish private correspondence no of course they do not have be very clear throughout that uefa and fifa have no issue with the bill as it be currently draft amendment be simply scaremongere on the part of the opposition it be also curiously at odd with one of their other amendment amendment the football governance statement which be also in the previous government bill allow the government of the day to set out their priority for the regulator this be no different from the strategic steer that the government can and do give to other regulator such as the competition and markets authority without undermine their operational independence the statement will be publish and lay before parliament parliamentary approval be neither appropriate nor necessary especially give the need to avoid political interference amendment and on levy exemption be simply not need the cost of regulation should not place an undue burden on club and cost should be transparent as set out in clause the regulator already have the power to exempt club from pay the levy through its levy rule we have long discussion in committee about assess how much this regulator be go to cost and how big it be go to be but all the amendment we put forward be vote down when will the minister know that this thing have grow too big and cost too much be grateful to the hon gentleman for his service on the bill committee he be right that we have very good debate and the impact assessment be of course approve by the previous minister for sport on amendment the governance code on appointment be clear that political activity be not bar to appointment david kogan have be find appointable for the role by panel that include senior independent panel member agree by the commissioner for public appointments and have now be endorse by the culture media and sport committee add further layer of robustness we will not set new precedent with the football regulator by go far than the governance code on appointment as the amendment propose more broadly on amendment and on conflict of interest if the interest of board or expert panel member might prejudice their ability to carry out their function the bill already capture that as conflict of interest on the owner and director test membership of proscribe organisation be an offence under the terrorism act and that offence be include in paragraph of schedule to the serious crime act such offence would already be consider when test an individual fitness so amendment be not require on amendment on the corporate governance code report on equality diversity and inclusion be key part of good corporate governance club will simply have to state what they be do on the issue on amendment on club charity know from my area of barnsley the brilliant work that the barnsley fc community trust do through change make in the other place the corporate governance code give club the flexibility to detail what action it be take to contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of the community that can include the work of the club official charity or wide work in the community so the amendment be not need new clause call for consultation on lift the ban on consume alcohol in view of the pitch that be outside the scope of the bill which focus on the sustainability of club and the game overall have raise the issue with the home office which be the policy lead as commit to do in committee do the minister agree with and my hon friend the member for york outer mr charters that we do need to look at alcohol sale but that we need to do it with all stakeholder in the round not just throw it in as gimmick to this bill which be about finance and governance my hon friend make good point and have reflect those comment to the relevant home office minister as say will turn to the amendment in the name of the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson thank he for his constructive approach to the scrutiny of the legislation and for his party support several of his amendment be outside the scope of the regulator but be sure that he will put on record some important and valid point on free to air tv in new clause the government believe that the current list of event work well and strike an appropriate balance between give access to sporting event and allow sport to maximise broadcasting revenue in domestic football the present arrangement under the list event regime have protect key moment such as the fa cup final while ensure that the premier league efl and fa be able to raise billion of pound annually which be invest back into the pyramid we all want to see more match be televise free to air but that must be balance against investment and not risk it on new clause on the golden share we expect that the regulator will welcome club take any measure to improve fan engagement and protect club heritage include golden share but it will not mandate they to do so that bring on to the issue of fan engagement which have be raise by the hon member for cheltenham and my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts in their amendment let be really clear the government have strengthen fan engagement the previous government bill require club to have framework in place to ensure that they regularly meet and consult with representative group of fan on key strategic matter at the club and other issue of importance to supporter we have improve that by require fan engagement to continue even if club enter into insolvency and by introduce requirement for consultation on ticket price we have not prescribe fixed one size fit all approach to fan engagement we of course expect the regulator to consult the football supporters association where appropriate on fan issue and know the shadow regulator be already engage with it we do not want to place an unmanageable burden on club unnecessarily which be why new clause be not need the hon member for cheltenham have also table amendment on protection for home ground which my hon friend the member for sheffield south east have also raise and we have recently discuss home ground be vital asset for club which be why the bill introduce protection to prevent inappropriate stadium sale and relocation clause and require club to get approval from the regulator before they sell or relocate their stadium on the sale of home ground let first clarify that the legislation use the term disposal rather than sale for technical legal reason for example club might sell portion of the stadium rather than the whole stadium that be because club might divest shareholding or transfer interest in the stadium without it amount to full sale under clause the regulator approval be need in all instance for the sale of stadium by club sale can be approve only if it would not undermine the sustainability of the club if sale might mean that the club will have nowhere to play few year down the line that mean the club may not be sustainable and the regulator be unlikely to approve the sale do the minister think that the regulator would take on board the view of fan as part of the process of look at these matter and have to give approval in the normal way yes absolutely and would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far will move on to the issue of player welfare the minister might be just about to say the thing be go to ask she about as she have address number of the amendment that my colleague have table which be the issue of footballer suffer from neurodegenerative condition after their time be sure she be about to say something about that in which case apologise as she will know the proportion of footballer suffer from these condition be significantly great than the proportion of the general population many former footballer many without the vast income that people assume footballer will have have in their career be leave in terrible situation not support by their club or the premier league what can the regulator do to get group like football families for justice the resource they need to support those who suffer have give their life to the game really appreciate the hon gentleman intervention know that he have work very hard on this issue be hugely sympathetic to the issue of player welfare it be important to say that the safety welfare and wellbeing of everyone take part in sport be absolutely paramount neurodegenerative disease be real concern of many people in the sport be not sure whether it should be part of the governance bill despite the fact that it be go to be the big socialist nationalise bill there have ever be in our lifetime laughter it be very serious issue though do my hon friend agree that it need to be look at and can she assure that the government will do so separately to the bill because of the urgency and the fact that people up and down this country at different level of football be suffer greatly mainly as result of head the ball be really grateful for that intervention again know that my hon friend have do huge amount of work on this issue have hear the call from member across the house and indeed from retired footballer and the secretary of state and recently meet small group of affected family and ex footballer include individual associate with football families for justice to discuss player safety and welfare for those suffer with dementia the government be commit to look far at this issue and support the family and football authority to come together to address the lifelong consequence from concussion as well as post career mental health and financial crisis be afraid that these measure be not within the tight regulatory scope of the bill although that do not mean that the government be not aware and sympathetic to the call be make on this issue both in this house and from many former player and their family the bill be focus on the financial sustainability of football club up and down the country too many fan have watch as their club make change on which they have no say from sell their stadium and change club colour to in the bad case collapse under inadequate ownership this be unacceptable it be devastating for fan and for local community it be this bill deliver by this labour government that will help to protect one of our great sporting asset and ensure that fan can focus on what be happen on the pitch rather than off it today member across this house can vote with football fan or they can vote against they today we can deliver an independent football regulator commend this bill to the house call the liberal democrat spokesperson we welcome this bill as do members across the house until few short month ago laughter indeed some of those member even come up with the idea like many in the chamber today we be disappoint that the consensus remain broken after an apparent direction from the leader of the opposition and that the conservatives have choose to turn their back on the sustainability of football quite so dramatically perhaps it be time to sack the manager while their time in government leave much to be desire the conservatives have the chance to claim statement win today after all as say this bill be their idea dame tracey crouch initiate the fan lead review and the previous government start this process now however the conservatives have spectacularly miss an open goal much like ronnie rosenthal at villa park in if be generous would say their performance on this bill have be like man united in throw away massive point lead only to finish with nothing instead fear for the shadow minister that they be more like spurs in somehow manage to finish third in two horse race although suppose come third be the sort of result the conservatives need to get use to throughout this process we have be clear on our position we be in favour of the principle of protect the heritage of our national game of great financial sustainability and of great fan involvement in the game we applaud the government approach in deliver that and we will support the bill on third reading later today because we remain consistent in our view none the less we think that the bill could go far let begin with the issue of free to air coverage in new clause we be call for key fixture from the domestic football calendar to be make available on free to air television this include selection of premier league match each season the league cup final and the play off final in the championship league one and league two as charlton athletic fan the shadow minister might have an interest in this one because his team might make the play off one day these would complement the exist free to air marquee event such as the fa cup the world cup and the euros this proposal be neither about undermine private broadcaster whose view figure sadly be already decline nor about devalue the broadcasting right on which club rely which be show sign of plateauing despite the addition of so many more live game to broadcast package rather this be an opportunity for broadcaster and the football league to innovate and to consider more direct route to access fan without paywall by introduce more free to air game broadcaster could explore wide sponsorship opportunity tie to large audience generate new appointment to view moment and engage fan who be currently price out of football not just in the stadium but on television too this approach be already prove successful in other country for example la liga broadcast one spanish top flight match per week free to air help to maintain widespread public engagement with the sport with the rise cost of living and the grow number of subscription service require to watch live football now total around year make more match available without paywall would ensure the game remain accessible first charlton do reach the play off and we be promote to the championship so be happy to correct the record for the hon member but on the broadcasting issue what cost analysis have the liberal democrats do on this issue give that we know that the premier league and the efl have already sign broadcast deal with the like of sky and other what be the economic impact for those club and league huge amount of money be already go around in football and we know that when we get to contract negotiation with the broadcaster and the league these thing be chunk up into package and when the next contract be up this would be one of those package do not see that there would need to be any massive economic impact it might seem odd that as scot want to intrude in this debate but the health of english football be valuable to we in scotland as well do my hon friend agree that if football be to continue on the current scale it need another generation to see it to love it and to want to take part in it the only really successful way of do that be to make it free to air to every household in this country at some point every week thank my hon friend for her intervention the point here be that gen and people young than those in the chamber today consume sport and medium in very different way interruption my pronunciation of gen have be correct it turn out that be out of touch those of we in the chamber today grow up watch football as minute game on television many of we on free to air today youngster will be watch social medium clip on tiktok they will be watch clip of people play game on computer as well if we be to get the next generation of fan involve the easy way to make sure that they be entertain and that they be engage be by make football free to air understand the point that the hon gentleman be try to make he suggest that there would not be cost impact on the broadcasting right but the liberal democrat amendment state that number of key match would be require to show on free to air tv channel every season and as highlight in my previous intervention those broadcasting deal be already in place do he not agree therefore that if member be to vote for the liberal democrat amendment today that would impact the broadcast deal already in play for the efl and the premier league do not believe that that necessarily have to be the case but we will see what happen later on if the shadow minister vote for our new clause in response to the shadow minister point have free to air coverage of premier league game put the sport in the shop window which be actually more likely to bring money in for non free to air provider we should also remember what football be all about it be about community live televise football match be communal event that everybody watch at the same time and it bring the country together have game accessible on television every week would be good for the sport go forward and it would mean that everyone can have access to football not only those with money my hon friend be absolutely right and would reflect that members interest in this point suggest that we be on to something as do the interest we have see in the medium today for the amendment turn to fan representation new clause and would introduce mandatory golden share for supporter group to protect club asset the bill provide some protection against some of the most egregious action of rogue football club owner but the golden share concept in new clause would add extra protection for club by give recognise supporter trust or equivalent democratic fan body formal veto over decision that could fundamentally alter the identity of their club such decision would include relocate the home ground to somewhere outside the club home area change the club name alter its primary colour or badge or enter competition not sanction by the fa the premier league or the efl the golden share concept be include in the recommendation of dame tracey crouch fan lead review but appear to have be drop somewhere along the way we believe it be time to bring it off the bench because supporter be more than just pay customer they be the living breathe heart of their club they carry the tradition culture and local identity that connect club to their community new clause would help to increase accountability and democratic oversight in club ownership and governance the need for it be obvious when we look at past event the attempt to rebrand hull city as hull tigers would have be veto by fan fan hold golden share would have block the move of wimbledon football club to milton keynes the golden share could have stop cardiff kit be change from blue to red it be entirely right that investor and owner be part of football future and they already have massive stake in this but it be just as important to protect the people who build the club and support they through thick and thin the golden share offer fair balance of power that protect heritage and ensure that fan be not sideline by reckless or profit drive decision that be at the heart of the aim of the bill this be my third intervention and have not yet mention blackburn rovers will now break that duck would the golden share allow fan to veto something like blackburn rovers outrageous decision to cease funding for their woman football team it mean that the team drop from the championship down to league several layer below simply because the owner venky disgracefully decide that they no long want to pay for woman team woman football be outside the scope of the bill but believe that the golden share concept would cover that sort of decision agree that what have happen to the blackburn rovers woman team be total disgrace turn to new clause our national game be something we all take immense pride in football be one of the cornerstone of british culture and it should never be use by individual or regime to cleanse their reputation or distract from human right abuse that be why we have table an amendment aim at strengthen ownership rule for football club prospective owner and director should face clear and enforceable test that include human right consideration the test would help to safeguard not only the value that underpin our national sport but the liberal and democratic principle that we as country and all of we in this house stand for it can not be right that we welcome with open arm those who preside over oppressive regime or be link to activity that potentially breach the value we hold so dear if football club owner be link to action that breach international law can we really say that our national game or this country should be host they we think not and that be why we have table new clause on player welfare which have be mention amendment would provide support for former professional footballer suffer from neurodegenerative condition while broken bone and tear ligament can be fix the long term effect of repeat head trauma often go unnoticed kevin moore chris nicholl nobby stiles and other give their good year to the sport and it be disgrace that many of they be now leave face devastating illness without the support that they need our amendment would require the football industry to allocate small share of its considerable wealth to those affect also want to acknowledge the work of michael giles john stiles and the football families for justice that work must be recognise here today finally turn to the issue of gambling in football cover in new clause gambling relate harm be widespread and deeply damaging fan watch football today be bombard with advert encourage bet from tv commercial to shirt sponsorship the influence of gambling in football have become overwhelming and dangerous gambling firm spend about billion year on advertising much of it direct at football fan it be unacceptable that football fan be have their game irrevocably link to that trade will the hon gentleman give way be afraid that have to make some progress the loss be not just financial they lead to mental health crisis family breakdown and even suicide public health england estimate that there be around gambling relate suicide annually we be not call for ban on gambling but on gambling advertising in football football must sever the link between the game and gambling this bill be an important step forward for our national game and we welcome it the beautiful game need its defender not just on the pitch but in parliament we must make the game more accessible to fan protect club heritage and ensure democratic fan representation we must prevent the sport from be exploit by corrupt regime support retire player suffer from neurological disease and stand up to the gambling industry grip on our national sport that be for the sake of the fan and for fairness but more importantly for the future of our national game our amendment would do all that and hope that member across the house as well as ministers will consider they today and in future as we be discuss new clause finish by say that we will vote for it rise order start with an immediate minute time limit call chris evans begin by declare an interest be the biographer of don revie the former leeds and england manager and the author of the football battalions about the footballer who go to war echo the tribute from the front bench to diogo jota whose life be lose last week he light up the premier league for both liverpool and wolves and we realise how short life be when we think about how he celebrate his wedding just day early and about the three child he leave behind also pay tribute to the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew for do so well when he be the right hon member for pudsey in construct the bill when in government it be shame that he do not agree with his former self the bill be bear out of the fan lead review but when we talk about football governance bill footballer need to be at the heart of it it be player who quicken the pulse and it be they who provide the memory that we cherish forever from childhood right through to now the memory that we pass on to our child therefore speak in favour of new clause which have table relate to neurodegenerative care scheme and new clause table by my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel just as fan be to be at the heart of the review the game would be nothing without the player broadly support the bill but it can be make well and if it can be make well we should do that the discourse surround the bill be often about the independent football regulator be safeguard for both fan and club but it should also be safeguard for ex player and their family if neurological condition or illness be most likely cause by their career in football unfortunately the bill neglect ex player and family who be affect by condition such as alzheimer parkinson and motor neurone disease they must be support through the creation of the independent football regulator it be evident that the effect of career in football be long lasting footballer be four to five time more likely to die from neurodegenerative condition often the result of persistently head the ball the independent football regulator must supervise and establish scheme aim at provide high standard of care player and their family dedicate themselves to the game and its danger and it be only fair that they be look after in return it should not be only their burden to bear especially after contribute so much to our society as have already be say football generate billion annually contribute billion in tax and support almost job agree with my hon friend we host football families for justice event few month ago most people be not aware that not all footballer make thousand and thousand of pound week this be the least that we can do to ensure that the pleasure that they have give we be respond to when they find themselves afflict with neurological condition such as alzheimer disease or parkinson hope that the government will listen and support the new clause thank my hon friend for her support what bring this home to about how much player be earn be when johnny giles the great leeds midfielder of the and show his first contract from when he be play for manchester united in the winter and in the summer that sum up how much they be pay point that come up at that important meeting which be attend by luminary include kevin keegan chris sutton paul walsh and barry fry be the complaint about the professional footballers association when raise this on second reading be bombard with email from its public affair arm say oh you ve get it all wrong but the question need to be ask it be the pfa member who be complain about it and say that it be not service they properly it should be ask why that be happen these be pfa member who have pay into its fund over the year and if they be not be treat well question need to be answer accord to new clause the secretary of state must set out the minimum requirement for the scheme timescale for the scheme establishment and arrangement and timescale for periodic review of the scheme furthermore all specify competition organiser should jointly operate manage and fund the scheme through the formation of joint co ordinating committee any current or former player who have at any time be register as professional footballer would be eligible for the scheme to this go beyond football if research be discover that help dementia parkinson or motor neurone disease the rest of society win this be something that football can lead and change society with this scheme will provide crucial care and financial support to any eligible person who suffer from neurodegenerative condition that be deem to have be cause by or contribute to by play football panel of independent expert must be appoint to determine whether neurodegenerative condition of an eligible person have be cause by or contribute to by play or training activity within the english football league it will also determine the appropriate provision of care and financial support require in each case the independent football regulator must ensure that the joint co ordinating committee act on the panel determination to ensure that ex player and their family get the support they need this be matter of urgency ex player who have give so much joy should be treat with dignity and respect and support when they need to be this new clause would ensure that pay tribute to campaigner include michael giles son of johnny and john stiles son of nobby they have campaign with dignity and respect and with quiet determination and it be time we show the same respect to they deny or ignore the link between football and neurological condition be no long sufficient recently we lose alan peacock who star for middlesbrough and leeds in the he can be add to the long list of name include jackie charlton and bobby charlton his brother who die of dementia martin peters ray wilson and of course nobby stiles the connection between football and neurological condition acquire later in life must be address in this bill and if it be not it must be address somewhere else this government especially labour government should treat injury cause by or contribute to by football like any other workplace or industrial injury and that be what my new clause would ensure we on this side be the party for worker and regardless of the industry it be our job to support and protect they especially as their union in their word let they down since football have contribute so much to our economy and more personally to fan happiness it be only common decency to support player when they be in need this can not be ignore any long not only must support be provide but the independent football regulator must be there for they rise today to speak to the new clause in my name and to lend my support to several of the other new clause some have already be speak about by my hon friend across the house new clause be about financial abuse mismanagement or fraud and about protect player new clause which my hon friend the member for caerphilly chris evans have just speak about deal with neurodegenerative care scheme football should never be luxury it should be share national experience accessible to family young people and lifelong fan but more and more it be become commodity game that be build by and for the work class be now price out of reach for the very people who give it life if want to attend the first premier league game in august would be look at pay over for two ticket on the secondary market that be before travel food and all the rise living cost be factor in even in ordinary time that be huge sum and for most people it be simply unaffordable football be become luxury experience not communal one historically football thrive because it be accessible its rise alongside the expansion of the railway network allow work people to follow their team home and away it become more than just sport it become pillar of community identity and pride fan the heartbeat of the sport be be push to the margin our current ticketing system be price they out that be why have table new clause which would introduce duty on club and competition organiser to ensure fair access and great transparency in ticket sale especially in resell ticket when fan be not able to attend we be see ticket price skyrocket while secondary ticketing platform exploit demand and rake in obscene profit the new clause would compel club to monitor the secondary market report harmful practice and offer resale channel to stop fan get rip off and scamme fan should know the real face value of ticket and have safe fair way to buy and resell they no more profiteering or shadowy resale platform the price of attend premier league game be beyond the mean of most fan even more so if they want to share that experience with family member should declare an interest as lifelong liverpool fan and offer my condolence to the family of diogo jota and his brother who tragically die recently while may be bias in think that it be the great club in the world also say with pride that liverpool have show what fan focus leadership look like the club recently freeze ticket price for the season follow discussion with the supporter board that model of engagement and sensitivity to supporter deserve recognition but not every club take that approach and that be exactly the problem we want to see this culture roll out across the country one where fan be not an afterthought but at the centre of decision making my new clause would make that approach requirement not just gesture of goodwill that lead to my second proposal new clause which would introduce mandatory vetting of foreign financial investment in football it be about protect the soul of english football from the corrosive influence of dirty money we have see at first hand how vulnerable club struggle under massive debt become easy target for opportunistic investor look to launder their reputation or gain geopolitical influence have raise this before sportswashing be now one of the most insidious trend in football where once the term might have bring to mind the berlin olympics or the baku european game today the uk be at the top of that list that should shame we repeat the example give in my speech on second reading of abramovich ownership of chelsea while it be see as huge success for the club his tie to the russian state and his close relationship with putin should have raise huge financial and ethical concern but these be overlook for year he use our game to rebrand himself shift attention away from question about the origin of his fortune but it be only follow the invasion of ukraine that real action be enforce that show exactly why we need strong safeguard to prevent that from happen again the new clause would empower the independent football regulator to block investment from fund link to money laundering criminal finance human right abuse or any breach of uk or international law that be the bare minimum if amnesty international or other watchdog have flag state or source of fund for its abysmal human right record there should be red flag not red carpet for the potential owner let we be honest fan sometimes embrace foreign investment out of desperation but the independent football regulator should protect the game from nefarious fund and owner this be not about bad actor it be about broken system club owner may not see the need for regulation we be protect not just finance but value if this bill and the independent regulator fail to stop the abuse of our football institution by criminal or oppressive regime they will have fail in their public duty rise be impose an immediate five minute time limit call clive betts thank you madam deputy speaker not for the time limit but for call the bill be crucial because football have fail to regulate itself it be key to ensure the sustainability of our great game the first aspect of it that really commend be the move to give the regulator power to ensure fair redistribution of money throughout the football pyramid it be clearly totally unfair that money be concentrate in handful of club at the top while other club struggle at the bottom and to remove the enormous cliff edge between the premier league and the championship thank the secretary of state and the sport minister for listen to the concern raise about the power of the regulator with regard to the backstop in improve the backstop in term of scope and process during the bill passage they have listen and act which be welcome indeed the other aspect of the bill that address sustainability be that it will now give the regulator power to deal with bad owner not just at first instance when they be buy the club but once they be in charge of it thank the minister for write to and clearly set out the power that the regulator will have to deal with owner who no long seem able to run club properly by intervene and take responsibility for the club away from they it would be helpful to put that letter in the public domain and the library despite be lifelong barnsley supporter be still grateful to my hon friend for host the sheffield wednesday supporter trust yesterday and for his leadership on this issue what be reflect back to we by the supporter trust be how unfair the current situation be club and therefore the fan be punish when irresponsible owner like the current owner of sheffield wednesday chansiri behave appallingly and do not put the fan first my right hon friend be absolutely right will turn in second to what the efl can do now for all that the minister have be helpful in explain what the regulator power will be the problem be that we be leave in the meantime without regulator and doubt about what the efl can do in that regard my hon friend the members for read central matt rodda for read west and mid berkshire olivia bailey and for earley and woodley yuan yang will be very much involve with the reading supporter trust and can tell we all the problem that they have experience my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale lizzi collinge have similar problem with her club there have be similar problem for derby and its fan as hon friend will know and the secretary of state will know about wigan the situation at sheffield wednesday be dire the owner have fail to pay wage for three month over the course of this year that affect not just the player some of whom may be well off while other be not the administrative staff clerk and all those people have not be pay for two month in some case the owner have not pay his majesty revenue and customs on two occasion it be clear that he be simply run out of money what action can the efl take we welcome the investigation that it be now conduct into what be go on at hillsborough but it be clear that although chansiri be fund the club to the tune of about million year he have now run out of money rob brookes of the wednesday supporter trust have do brilliant analysis of chansiri company in thailand which be by and large now lose money he be not able to fund the club so where have the money be come from to keep it go for the past two or three year have he borrow it if so who have he borrow it from what be the condition on that borrowing be the people who lend he the money now effectively run the club and tell chansiri that he can not sell it he have turn down many approach to sell the club and be demand ridiculous price for it have the money be borrow from reputable source do not know be not make an accusation the only person who can clarify this awful situation be mr chansiri himself but he will not comment on it we welcome the efl investigation as my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley louise haigh say we want the efl to find out what be happen and to be transparent and open about what it know about the whole issue why when chansiri produce business plan in march do the efl accept it how far do it question that plan have give the efl business plan say that he be financially sustainable he fail to pay wage hour later he have two five hour engagement with the fan and never once mention his problem fund the club as my right hon friend the member for sheffield heeley say what we do not want be for the efl to come in and its only action be to punish the club with transfer embargo and point deduction to the point where sustainable sale to someone else be not possible say to the efl you be the only hope we have until the regulator come in so please work with the fan trust and other to find the good way forward tell we what you know and what you know now and expose what chansiri have be do because it be an absolute disgrace that club of sheffield wednesday stature should be reduce to this situation we have hear today that because of the safety of sports grounds act sheffield city council have issue directive that unless work be do on the north stand roof it will close part of the ground come the start of the season but the club have know about that for three year this be an appalling situation ask the minister and the secretary of state to talk to the efl about how far they can work with they to save the situation welcome the minister for sport letter to the commitment to fan engagement and the commitment on the fsa role go forward but the regulator must have the power to intervene if it feel that external competition such as the club world cup interfere with our domestic competition thank she very much for her engagement right through this process rise to speak in favour of the amendment table by my hon friend the member for cheltenham max wilkinson specifically new clause and will start by outline why these fan centric measure be important to this particular fan and why football be important to football have be the most constant thing in my life when be young boy my uncle call statto because use to study teletext for every bit of football information could get the league table the top scorer all the transfer news and relay it to my family until annoy the hell out of all of they football be also the central bond with my grandparent or pops as use to know he so much so that when he pass take his ash down the tottenham high road and lay they in the foundation of the new tottenham hotspur stadium football be probably the most frequent conversation have with my dad and the thing that glue all my friendship network together have to confess that be politician be not my first career choice just like every young boy think could be footballer despite hour of effort after school every day be never go to be good enough but never give up play football throughout my university year and form many friendship that way after that we do not want to stop so we set up an alumnus football club together and carry on eventually join carshalton football club whose club tie be wear today and still play on saturday except for the weekend when be injure those moment in beddington park play for carshalton football club be some of the only moment when get to switch off from all this my teammate would probably say that also switch off too much on saturday when the winger run past then there be the watching of football the lunacy of continue to watch let tell you madam deputy speaker the journey from carshalton to tottenham and back on rainy tuesday night be brutal particularly when we lose the number of game that tottenham lose this year yet in the same season when have have all that misery have one night in bilbao last month that be probably one of the good night of my life be that just football misery and sublime night like that all in one go the centrality of football to people life be what make this bill so important people have feel in recent year that the game have drift away from they and some people reaction be to say that the way it be be glad that through the bill the government be say that we will not be resign to that fact we be go to fight stop that drift and bring it close to fan again that bring to new clause which be about the golden share this be particularly important because it would lock in the fan voice via democratically elect organisation that would mean that club would not be able to simply pay lip service to the element of consultation with fan there would be real power for the fan with their presence inside the club of course this do not go anywhere near as far as other country like germany with the bundesliga but it be an important protection we speak at length early about new clause and the free to air element understand why there be bit of controversy around that and why the secretary of state will say that the current listing system work well but who do it work well for it certainly work well for the premier league but be not sure whether it work well for all fan the new clause would not go as far as la liga which broadcast game every single week let we not kid ourselves we be talk about game out of available that would be of game do not think that would destroy the premier league product but it would make game so much more accessible to the next generation of fan the premier league be global attraction but it be also england product and english fan should be able to watch those game there be other element of the bill that could go on to support but be short on time so will just express my support for new clause which be important end with this quote from famous tottenham manager bill nicholson we must always consider our supporter for without they there would be no professional football it would be well to have more fan watch football the way they like it play rather than have few fan watch football the way we would like it play those be important word that we should all reflect on when vote today it be real pleasure to speak in support of the bill we stand on manifesto that promise to establish an independent regulator to ensure financial sustainability for football club in england today we will be deliver on that promise for football fan across the country regardless of the club they support of course doncaster rovers be the only team worth note doncaster rovers unite the community in my constituency and hold special place in all our heart in fact local artist martin black will soon release song for charity call this be my city which be about community spirit and the hometown pride that stem from support your local team it encapsulate what grassroot football really mean the government recognise the importance of fan in the football industry and be put they at the heart of the game once more as we have hear fan should never risk lose their beloved club because of financial instability stem from mismanagement and reckless spending however would like to highlight the need to support football player from all league after their career john stiles son of the legend nobby stiles be one of my constituent first meet john in one of my early surgery not long after be elect to discuss his involvement with the football families for justice campaign which as we have hear focus on support ex footballer and their family when they face devastate neurodegenerative disease as result of their football career pay tribute to john for all the work he have do on the campaign he have really be leader in the area research show that ex footballer be four or five time more likely to suffer from parkinson alzheimer motor neurone disease and other similar disease unfortunately that be the case for nobby the pfa have be mention so for the sake of time will not go into it any far but it be sadden that an industry with such vast amount of wealth offer so little support to ex footballer when they face unforeseen health impact result from their time on the pitch understand that the bill scope mean that some of the suggest change be not currently in the legislation but ask the minister and the department to give far thought to the adequacy of support provide to ex footballer and their family when they face neurodegenerative disease as have be say not all footballer be earn million of pound every year in fact many earn very little and have relatively short career in the context of their life the football industry be carry on the skill and sacrifice of its player as well as its fan it be disappointing that the industry do not really recognise that if even only small proportion of wealth in the industry be make more easily accessible to player and support ex professional that would go long way to deliver justice for those player and their loved one hope to continue my engagement with the minister and the department on this matter however welcome this bill and the fact that it will ensure consistent approach in how club be run by implement club licensing regime and tackle rogue owner and director be pleased that the bill have the support of club doncaster in my constituency on its behalf remind the minister of the importance of ensure that the regulator provide objective and competent oversight of the football governance model club and their system deserve financial sustainability to protect the heritage of english football football be part of our culture and history with the recent and well deserve promotion of donny rovers be pleased that this government be take step to protect its legacy and its future rise to support new clause and amendment on behalf of one of my constituent the former arsenal and leeds goalkeeper john lukic be grateful to john for bring to my attention the grow number of ex player suffer from chronic traumatic encephalopathy form of dementia cause by repeatedly head the ball research show that retire footballer be more than three time more likely to suffer from dementia than the general population cte be progressive and irreversible disease that leave individual suffer from memory loss and unable to carry out basic day to day activity as result those around they often become their carer and have to endure watch their love one gradually lose their memory and independence the modern game be awash with money the premier league late tv deal be worth billion despite the huge sum of money available only million have to date be commit to support player suffer from neurodegenerative disease as we have already hear few time the situation have leave former player such as world cup winner nobby stiles have to sell their medal to fund their care while footballer have always be pay comparatively well the player from the and earn nothing like the sum that modern star be pay and their career be short it be worth highlight that this issue may not go away although football be not as heavy as they use to be they now travel fast mean that the overall impact of head ball can be similar therefore support these measure in solidarity with football families for justice which join in call for legislation to be enact that will ensure competition organiser be require to provide funding towards neurodegenerative care scheme unfortunately unless competition organiser be make to do it the belief be that they will not just as the football governance bill seek to protect fan from profit drive venture such as the creation of new super league it be right that the bill should also protect the player who give so much to make the game what it be be encourage by what the minister have say on this matter we rightly hear that football be nothing without the fan but the fan turn out only for the player football need to support they congratulate the secretary of state and the sports minister my hon friend the member for barnsley south stephanie peacock on bring the bill to this point also congratulate they on listen to argument about how we treat the vast resource that come in through tv deal and distribute they throughout the football pyramid particularly in give the regulator power over parachute payment if he deem it necessary sincerely hope he will if we do not get an agreement between the english football league and the premier league those payment really distort competition particularly in the championship that need to be address in this bill and congratulate the secretary of state and the minister on do that support the new clause and amendment table by my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts they deal with how we identify the people who really begin this journey the sport fan this start with the super league and the fan reaction to it they be determined to stop club from break away from the premier league and form super league with other club from across the globe the reaction of fan shock the conservative government at the time into action they could not really resist the power of fan have bring we to this point we need to understand how we can identify fan bona fide supporter of club and consult they on how we regulate the game go forwards my hon friend the member for sheffield south east be attempt to do that through some of his amendment my hon friend have identify another very important factor which be how we prevent asset be attractive to those people who look to take over club not because they be interested in football in any way but because they see asset of value from which they can make money by run club into the ground they seek to make profit from those asset through the asset of community value power or something similar my hon friend be try to prevent that from happen if his amendment be not accept or vote on tonight would certainly commend they to the regulator who hope will take heed of what my hon friend be attempt to achieve one other amendment add my name to be new clause because think the shadow minister the hon member for old bexley and sidcup mr french be on to something why do we treat other sport differently from football why be football single out well think we know the story of that but it have be long time since the issue of alcohol at football ground have be look at there be nothing unreasonable about ask club and the football community to look at whether we can relax those rule in certain circumstance so that where club want to do it they can do it and should do so in partnership with their fan review of that issue would not be bad thing at all this bill be giant leap forward for football in this country commend my right hon and hon friend on the front bench for what they have achieve and wish the bill fair wind it be an immense privilege to rise once again to support this important bill during its passage through parliament want to draw particular attention to amendment and which stand in the name of my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts those amendment would require club home ground to be designate as an asset of community value as part of its operating licence welcome the remark make by the minister during her opening speech about the safeguard that be already in the bill to protect home ground club stadium be more than its stand plastic seat some turf and the woodwork it have spirit it be part of the club identity it have memory high and low soak up in its wall we must protect these important asset for the community they mean so much to in many case club stadium be inherently bind up with the place that surround it and can form link between the sport and the identity of the town or city it sit in crewe alexandra home ground the mornflake stadium be name after an iconic historic local milling business and producer of breakfast food found in and be overlook by the railway line that give birth to the town similarly nantwich town fc stadium sit on the bank of the river weaver which literally connect the club to the town centre and beyond strongly believe that we can and should go far to strengthen the link between club and community which be why be delighted recently to join stuart price trevor griffiths and aaron lewis on the fantastic railwaymen podcast dedicated fan podcast for crewe alexandra fc we discuss exactly how we might strengthen those link work together in partnership be delighted to be work closely with the podcast and other key stakeholder in the town to commission mural to the club which could act as bridge between the stadium and the town centre although it be early day for that project extend an early invitation to visit to the secretary of state and the minister who have only just be in my constituency to open boxing gym but be always welcome to come back if we be successful in commission that mural finally it be great shame that the conservative party and reform have thus far join force to try to frustrate the progress of this bill as the shadow minister be indicate reform member be once again not even in the chamber although have to say that there be not many member on the conservative benches either our game need an independent football regulator the football league need it and believe the premier league need it too if opposition member be in any doubt encourage they to read the case for an independent football regulator write by crewe alexandra supporter tom kural it set out in illuminate clarity why this change in the law be need and why member from all part of the house should be in no doubt that fan in my constituency and be sure in theirs want this change before opposition members walk through the lobby tonight encourage they to think carefully about what fan like tom in their constituency think as someone bear and raise in derby know how deeply our football club run through the heart of our city derby county be more than just team it represent our identity our pride and the strength of our community however like so many in this house also know what it feel like when that identity be put at risk in derby county enter administration the confusion and lack of transparency that follow make it much hard for everybody involve include those of we work behind the scene to help secure the club future it be only thank to the extraordinary action of local man and lifelong fan david clowes that the club be save one example that highlight the need for strong oversight be the attempt takeover of derby county by chris kirchner despite initial approval it become clear that kirchner be not fit and proper person to run the club his financial shortcoming and failure to meet deadline lead to the takeover attempt collapse later kirchner be convict of fraud relate charge in the us over his business dealing and sentence to year in prison that be why welcome the football governance bill which offer the protection that derby county and so many other club across the efl need while the facial expression of opposition members be worth an intervention all on their own do my hon friend agree that this bill provide strong financial oversight and increase fan involvement promote equity and inclusion protect club heritage and increase transparency and accountability the reason the opposition oppose it be because those be alien concept to they absolutely the face of opposition members say it all will talk little more about the content of the shadow minister speech in second the efl have need this bill and it want this bill it will establish the independent football regulator introduce proper financial oversight and finally require club to engage seriously with the fan who give the club their life we do not need to look far to see that the problem be ongoing they be happen in front of our eye my own chief of staff be devoted sheffield wednesday fan and be deeply trouble by the instability and uncertainty surround her club like so many fan she see an owner who clearly do not have the resource require to run the club appropriately pay tribute to my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts for the work he have do and continue to do to stand up for fan and the future of their beloved sheffield wednesday this bill be not just policy proposal but vital step towards fair and more sustainable future for our national game club in the efl will lose around million this season alone the level of instability be not just damaging but dangerous we have already see what happen when thing go wrong from bury to bolton to read the pattern be clear and it can not be allow to continue the efl want this bill most club across the english league support this bill most importantly fan want this bill genuinely ask why the conservatives do not what make it even more frustrating be the political opportunism we be see when in government the conservative party bring forward an almost identical bill to the one we be debate today now in opposition they seem prepared to vote against the bill not because the policy have change but because the politic have change that be not leadership that be put party before the future of our club and the community that they serve the truth be that there be more than enough money in english football to sustain the entire pyramid the problem be how that money be distribute last year club receive of the game revenue while other club be leave to fight over the remain the new regulator will have the tool to help fix that and to ensure that club be run properly sustainably and in the good interest of the people they represent this bill be chance to safeguard the heritage the future and the very soul of english football support it proudly on behalf of derby and urge colleague across the house to do the same let we protect the game before it be too late let begin by draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests rise to speak today with sense of relief because read football club have finally be sell be one of thousand in the stadium in my constituency during the may bank holiday weekend when we hear that the sale have finally go through the relief and joy in the crowd be palpable and we all chant we ve get our reading back it be the last game of the season and because the minister my hon friend the member for barnsley south stephanie peacock be present on the front bench will not mention the score as well as the relief about the sale however share fan deep frustration because we should never have have to fight so hard to save our club be so glad to welcome number of read fan who be sit in the gallery have travel to parliament to witness this historic piece of legislation just few short month ago our club one of the old in english football be on the brink of expulsion from the english football league its decline be drive by governance failure absentee ownership and the ultimate toothlessness of the exist regulation we be so close to lose our club not just to relegation but to administration or even insolvency in the bad week it seem that be call the efl and prospective bidder and other stakeholder almost every other day try to find solution thankfully our club be finally sell but it could so easily have go the other way and for too many club such as bury and macclesfield it have go the other way more than club in the top six tier of the english man game have go into administration since which show that the game be in deep need of repair and of independent regulation even today club such as sheffield wednesday suffer from similar issue and pay tribute to all my labour colleague in that city who be fight so hard for their club as well as my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale lizzi collinge and many other member across the house yet it should not be up to mps and fan to mount rescue campaign fan should not be the one organise petition stag protest or become forensic accountant to hold the owner to account yet read fan do everything from march in the street to work with member from across the house over fan sign my petition to hold an inquiry into reading absent owner and many come to watch the westminster hall debate that lead in march even have the assistance of fan when pore over the complex corporate structure of read football club in the hope of find legal solution meanwhile relentlessly pester ministers speak to the efl and meet the shadow regulator want to say big thank you to the sell before we dai campaign the supporters trust at reading the non governmental organisation fair game and all the mps from all party who work alongside we the burden place on supporter by all this be enormous emotionally financially and physically fan should not have to go through this we need strong and smart regulation as have say before any regulator must pass the reading test that mean have the power to disqualify unfit owner and crucially to force sale when club future be at risk thank the minister for her constructive and serious engagement throughout the committee consideration be especially glad to hear her strong response to the amendment table in committee by my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts on the regulator power to force divestment from unsuitable owner and have read she on the record response be grateful for her clarification she explain for instance that the regulator may appoint an interim officer to assist club to operate effectively in the owner absence may require club to change its constitution if that be the most appropriate way to secure an unsuitable owner removal and may in the most extreme case force rogue owner to divest at no minimum price direct that owner to take no part in the running of the club in the meantime hope that the minister will reaffirm those point in her wind up speech today to make it clear to all that the bill do pass the reading test this bill have be long time come and thank everyone who work on it include those in the previous government under the leadership of dame tracey crouch and her fan lead review as well as the previous secretary of state and minister for sport be incredibly relieved that the bill be here and it reflect the broad cross society consensus and what be until very recently cross party consensus that we need this regulation which be sorely lack from the game my hon friend be make great speech apparently of fan support this bill but recent polling have the conservative party at do she agree that these fact alone should give conservative front benchers pause for thought before they oppose the bill my hon friend make very good point be very surprised to see conservative front benchers whip their colleague to oppose bill that they have previously introduce in part and support we have build cross society consensus because of the work of dame tracey and many other like she and we should respect that work and the importance of regulate football so that it be financially sustainable anyone who have read the fan lead review will know that it ultimately suggest that football should be give back to the fa and the league themselves our position be to accelerate that now rather than appoint labour regulator the approach of the conservative party here and in the lords have be to delay this bill and any progress make on regulation for far too many month during which my club have struggle to go on without any independent regulation would like to see some reflection from conservative front benchers about what that mean not just for reading but for many club that be wait for the regulator to come in let reading be one of the last club that have to fight this hard to survive and let this bill be the turning point let we do what the shadow minister the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew have say let we crack on with this bill have hop to come to the house today with spring in my step have see the sale of morecambe fc go through instead morecambe fc and our town have be put through hell over the past week or so and we still can not see the end of it more than day ago the efl approve buyer panjab warriors which be ready and willing to buy clearance have be grant and over month worth of fund significant amount have already be pump into the football club by the new buyer the current owner jason whittingham operate as the bond group say he be ready to sell but instead of get the deal do he have for whatever reason stall he have delay and give excuse and he have try to dismiss the board in fact it be only through the good intention of the local board member and the responsibility that they feel towards morecambe that they return to try to facilitate the sale but yet again jason stall so now the board have go again panjab warriors which have already pour lot of money into the club have make it clear that everything be ready from its end but the sale have still not be complete most distressingly staff and player have not be pay their full wage have receive email from constituent who work for the club and who be desperately worried about how they will pay their bill our local citizen advice bureau and food bank have have to step in because that be what we do in morecambe we look after our own tomorrow the club be due to pay in vat unless the sale go through there be no way the club can meet this obligation until now have restrain myself from use the full extent of parliamentary privilege in this matter because my focus have be on get the sale do have hold my tongue while the efl go through its due diligence process and have implore jason whittingham directly to just get on with the sale but my restraint have not produce the progress that have hop for so now feel duty bind to use parliamentary privilege to lay out what see suspect that jason whittingham have build house of card and it be now fall down around his ear there be mention of further unspecified investor even at this final stage and there be suspicion that the club be be use to leverage his personal financial situation morecambe fc be be hold hostage and it break my heart morecambe fc be the cornerstone of our community and what be happen in morecambe show exactly why this bill be need the like of jason whittingham should never have be allow to buy football club last week the secretary of state answer question in this house about the sale and thank she and the minister for sport for all their support behind the scene in deal with this unfold disaster this labour government have stand by my community and frankly be baffle as to why the conservatives be oppose this bill know what football club mean to town such as morecambe this bill be crucial step to stop other town like morecambe go through this heartache urge member across the house to please support this bill and say to jason come on sign the damn paperwork refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests also associate myself with the tribute from my hon friend the minister after the tragic death of diogo jota my son be liverpool fan and his generation of liverpool fan regard he as one of the fine player in the club so it be very sad news for they rise to speak to my two amendment to the bill amendment and the link new clause also support new clause table by my hon friend the member for caerphilly chris evans this be great bill that will improve football and the financial stability of club but want to raise the failing of the great game of football with regard to the financial wellbeing of player these amendment seek to address ongoing financial grooming and disregard for player welfare in the football industry believe this be an historic opportunity to reform football governance in england for the long term good of club supporter and player however to leave out the wellbeing protection and long term security of player the very people who drive the game whom we see week in and week out in the stand and on television and who be the beat heart of football would be fundamental mistake have write letter to the secretary of state support by over dozen member of parliament and current and former professional player coach and manager across the game include many legend of the game many of those have be victim of financial grooming and fraud they have write alongside and other member to express our strong support for the introduction of an independent football regulator and to urge that player welfare be include in the regulator remit the current system be fail too many player issue affect player welfare span financial exploitation and mental health problem to retirement transition and dementia the support system be fragment opaque and often reactive at well despite the professional footballers association mandate too many player feel unsupported unprotected or unheard these be not just historic problem they be happen now this be not simply matter of correct the past new form of financial exploitation be appear today particularly through digital platform and sophisticated form of financial exploitation and grooming some of the individual involve remain active in football and operate unchecked and outside meaningful oversight player especially young one continue to face avoidable risk such as predatory financial advice and abuse post career mental health problem and financial crisis and in many case the lifelong consequence of concussion this be rare and timely legislative moment the football governance bill be once in generation opportunity to embed protection for everyone in the game not just club and investor but player too include player welfare in the regulator scope would ensure that minimum standard transparency and accountability be apply across football regulated environment would provide strong co ordination between the club the premier league the efl the pfa the fa the league managers association and other associate organisation ultimately benefit all party football must be more than financially sustainable it must also be ethically sound that mean protect the health dignity welfare and future of the player who give everything to the sport urge the government to ensure that player welfare be not overlook as this important legislation move forward my amendment seek to safeguard the current and former player involve in english football who have be victim of financial abuse mismanagement or fraud or who be at risk of become victim of financial abuse mismanagement and fraud my new clause seek to embed measure aim at achieve the financial abuse mismanagement and fraud objective unfortunately we see financial abuse and groom across the sport music medium and cultural industry football be not unique however this be unique opportunity for the regulation of football that could lead as an example for other area want to finish by say that this be classist abuse of young and bud talent my hon friend talk about the class system it be tell that in other country that perhaps have less class base society football be recognise as culture do he agree that football should be recognise in this country on par with other cultural opportunity such as the theatre and opera absolutely do as leeds united fan know that we definitely cross the spectrum from sport to culture everybody have probably see the damned united in country such as spain football go across the cultural spectrum but the ownership of club be also with the fan and not with oligarch as the former chelsea owner be or other there be different cultural aspect to it in other european country as be say this be classist abuse of young and budding talent that exploit their life for the benefit of financially high power middleman labour driving mission be to protect work people against exploitation let we include football player in our party found mission and give they the protection they deserve it be pleasure to speak once again on this important bill happily declare an interest as season ticket holder at selhurst park and long term fan of crystal palace be still bask in the glory of our wembley triumph in may promise to stop talk about it soon but hope to milk it for another couple of month if can this hugely overdue bill have wide support from fan and community across our country as evidence by its adoption of the key recommendation of the fan lead review the central insight of the review be that as we all know what be essentially true about football be that it be not like any other industry and can not be treat as such football club be more than just local business across our country they sit at the heart of our community as dartford football club do in my constituency they be anchor institution culturally and economically and hope that hon member on both side of the house will support the bill to put in place new set of rule to protect club empower fan and keep club where they belong at the heart of our community for that reason it be privilege to serve on the bill committee the third of my first year in this place hesitate to claim that it be parliamentary hat trick what set that committee apart be the opposition baffle approach to the legislation as we can see on the amendment paper today we be tell on the committee first day that the reason the conservative party be against the bill despite have introduce it in the last parliament be that despite it be close in spirit and letter to the previous version it now represent clear case of over regulation in the word of the leader of the opposition in the sit day that follow blizzard of amendment be visit on the committee by the opposition the majority of which increase the power scope and responsibility of the regulator for instance there be an amendment to investigate and possibly cap agent fee which notice have not return on report and one on alcohol in football ground which have return as new clause as well as range of other matter do my hon friend not think it be bit rich of the opposition give the problem they have in the when they do not stamp out hooliganism and instead think that the way forward be to pen fan in behind electrify fence and even to introduce id card to claim that they be now stand up for football fan do think that the conservative government attitude in the be to treat football fan as less than human would not wish to say that opposition members be not football fan but the empty terrace on their side of the chamber bespeak lack of interest in the bill the opposition amendment that be design to increase the scope and responsibility of the regulator would also increase the cost of the regulator to club which be another of the opposition complaint they be at pain to try to point out that the regulator will cost fan dear but their amendment would increase that cost what we need and what the bill provide be an agile and lean independent regulator whose effort can not be divert from the key objective which be to create financially sustainable football pyramid that be responsive to fan will touch briefly on couple of the other amendment table for discussion today be sympathetic to the aim of new clause table by the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson and echo other comment that the approach of the hon gentleman and his party to the bill have be incredibly constructive in contrast with that of the official opposition new clause would set out in legislation requirement for all these different match to be free to air while be sympathetic to that do not think the hon gentleman new clause or indeed anything specify such thing on the statute book be wise because the bill intention be not to get involve in commercial deal however would like to see more top class football on free to air television in order to give young fan the chance to watch more than just highlight on video or social medium on amendment and must confess strong agreement with my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts and what he be seek to achieve the separation of club and home ground both past and present as we see with sheffield wednesday case that know that be very dear to my hon friend heart invariably end in serious jeopardy for the club as he say it invite speculator to treat ground as just another asset rather than something central to their community and apart from anything else it cause major problem when club change hand it be an issue that need to be address also agree with the point my hon friend the member for sheffield south east make in committee about want the state of the game report which the regulator will have to produce to be bring forward as soon as possible so that its analysis can be use to broker financial distribution deal across the pyramid at the early opportunity in our manifesto ahead of last year election labour say that we be committed to make britain the good possible place in the world to be football supporter the bill deliver this commitment for sustainable game put club at the centre of our community and fan at the heart of our game it be privilege to have the chance to speak in this debate on an issue of such importance in legislation one that go to the heart of our national identity which be the future of the beautiful game football like shakespeare the beatles and james bond be one of this country great contribution to the world not just fantastic sport but global phenomenon and arguably our most successful cultural export english football be watch by billion globally with some of the most exciting player club and story of any league however we must not allow that success to disguise the underlie fragility in the english football pyramid too many club have collapse in recent year with consequence ripple through entire community in my constituency while it have not collapse the football club for chipping norton have be away from the town for more than decade its ground be buy and sell off by what shall refer to as rather unscrupulous individual with little regard for the club the town or its fan and that loss be still deeply feel however there be also hope down the road at banbury united supporter feed up with mismanagement take matter into their own hand they have transform the club take it over and turn it into community benefit society with revenue from shirt sale and matchday ticket now go back into support local group and good cause after two successive promotion they have prove that this model be not barrier to success on the pitch know that the secretary of state and the minister have many call on their time but can assure they that they would both be give warm welcome should they choose to grace the hallowed turf of the spencer stadium in banbury and once again invite they to my constituency to do just that while neither chipping norton nor the puritans be within the scope of this legislation because they be not high enough up the football pyramid not yet anyway their story and those of countless other up and down show why this reform be so necessary my hon friend talk eloquently about the need for well regulation we have just hear that he be fan of banbury united and that my hon friend the member for dartford jim dickson be fan of crystal palace do that not show that there be complete agreement across the football pyramid that there need to be well regulation in football and that that would benefit all level of the game thank my hon friend for her intervention also congratulate crystal palace on their fa cup win and as liverpool fan look forward to their receive their runner up medal in the community shield in couple of week time as say in my intervention early this have the support of of fan so find it simply stagger that conservative members have decide that have put forward this legislation they be now against it for who know what reason too many club have be leave vulnerable to reckless ownership and financial mismanagement and it simply can not continue the bill be vital step to ensure that football be sustainable for the benefit of fan and their community both now and into the future it will promote financial stability prevent rogue owner and director from cause harm and give supporter strong voice in how their club be run safeguard both the game and the strength of community that it foster my hon friend will know that my football club southend united nearly disappear because of mismanagement do he agree that the bill will make sure that we keep these football club at the heart of our community because ultimately that be where they belong my hon friend be absolutely right when we talk about rogue owner be only surprised that the hon member for great yarmouth rupert lowe with his year of experience in this sphere decide to walk out of the chamber but we will leave that for now and move on as have say the previous government strut on to the pitch full of promise but when the whistle blow they pass sideways run down the clock and then bottle it at the big moment in contrast this government have show intent and be drive the ball forward be proud to support this bill in the lobby tonight be so grateful to hon member who have not just speak in this debate today but bring the real life experience and voice of fan into this chamber this have be parliament at its good ensure that those affect be finally hear and that action be take be grateful to all member who have speak regardless of whether the government be choose to accept the amendment that they have put forward wish to address some of the very many valid point that have be make during the course of this debate shall start with the issue of player welfare which be clearly of such concern to so many member from all part of the house it be raise by my hon friend the members for doncaster central sally jameson for derbyshire dales john whitby for caerphilly chris evans for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams and for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron among other it have also be raise by many many other member over the course of the past year both with and my hon friend the minister for sport wish to reassure the house that although the amendment around player welfare do not fit within the scope of this bill that do not mean that the government do not treat it with the urgency and the utmost seriousness that it demand as my hon friend the minister say we be privileged to meet recently number of family who have be affect by this and who have be campaign for justice for far too long that include john stiles to whom many hon member have pay tribute he speak very movingly about the experience of his father and his family they be not wealthy people and they deserve well treatment as government we be determined to grip this issue we be clear that football can and must do more will be pleased to update the house as we make progress in that pursuit of justice also thank the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed for his point about secondary ticketing and the associate point that he make about the cost of football which for many fan particularly in the premier league be of significant concern this game belong to its fan it be nothing without its fan it be important that fan be able to access the game that they love and that they have build he will know that the government waste no time in open consultation about secondary ticketing across the board our message be clear the time be up for ticket tout the consultation that my right hon friend the business secretary and launch seek to work out how not whether to act on this issue we be shortly about to publish the response to that consultation and it will be before the house imminently be really grateful to all hon member who have stand up for fan whether they be music fan football fan or other fan it really matter that they be hear do the secretary of state agree that this bill put fan at the heart of where they should be and that have the bill be in place early club like mine bolton wanderers would not have come close to collapse live just down the road from my hon friend in bolton and have many friend who be directly affect by what happen at bolton wanderers so thank she for her tireless support for the fan and the town many people do not appreciate until they have be through situation like that as she and have that it do not just affect the football fan in the town bolton wanderers stand for its town as wigan athletic do it be part of our identity and our pride it be also part of our family inheritance the chairwoman of my supporter club use to go to the football with her dad when she be little girl she now take her child and they will take their child football club be institution that stand at the centre of our town and they deserve to be pass on to the next generation as part of our civic inheritance my hon friend the member for bolton north east kirith entwistle mention what happen with bolton wanderers fan of read fc across berkshire include in bracknell experience something similar when they be able to support the club to be save from an unfit owner do the secretary of state agree that it be so important that we pass the bill so that we can prevent what happen to read from ever happen to football club again when my club wigan athletic be in trouble because of poor ownership for the second time use those precise word say that this must be the last time this ever happen to football fan but as my hon friend rightly say here we be with so many member tell heartbreaking story about the near loss of their club so could not agree with he more want to acknowledge to the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson and for carshalton and wallington bobby dean that although we may disagree about the good way to improve access and protect the financial sustainability of the game do not doubt for one moment their sincerity in want to make sure that far more people can experience the joy of football the minister for sport say to early that it have be pleasure to work with the hon member for cheltenham to get this bill on to the statute book so be grateful to he for his work turn to new clause table by my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts who have do extraordinary work throughout the passage of the bill want to address the point that he do not have time to speak to early we absolutely understand why he be pursue this matter and he be right to do so but we believe that the clause be not necessary be happy to pass on the commitment that the minister for sport make to she will write to my hon friend with full explanation of why the clause be not necessary and copy of the letter will be place in the house of commons library on behalf of the whole house thank my hon friend for the expertise that he have bring to bear as try to set out my intention be simply to draw attention to whether the regulator have the power it do not necessarily have to use it to intervene if the domestic competition that all club engage in be be damage by competition like the club world cup from which handful of club make multimillion of pound want to make sure that the regulator have the power to deal with that we believe that it do as say the minister will write to he on that point and place copy of the letter in the library so that the whole house can understand the government position let turn to the hon member for old bexley and sidcup mr french do not really know where to start with this to be honest but be determined to give it try when it come to the government preferred candidate gently point out to the hon member that this be candidate that have be strongly endorse by the cross party culture media and sport committee he be appoint by the last conservative government to the board of channel and as make clear moment ago he be on the list that inherit from the conservative government and the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew who now serve as the shadow secretary of state along with conservative donor as well it be astonishing that the shadow minister have come to this house belatedly with allegation of cronyism and that the good and only defence that he have be able to offer for this breathtaking hypocrisy be that his right hon friend the shadow secretary of state do not have clue what be go on in his own department can he not see how absurd that be will she give way of course will would love to know the answer let explain for the benefit of members who be not in the room at the start of the debate that the discussion be about the fact that the gentleman in question say in the select committee that he be not approach by the then minister but by civil servant the secretary of state be try to say now that her department be not under investigation be that correct be you under investigation for this appointment order first be not secondly the secretary of state come very close to unparliamentary language in accuse another hon member of hypocrisy be sure she do not intend that out of respect for you mr deputy speaker be happy to clarify think that the shadow minister might be bit confused to add to the confusion refer he to point make strongly by my hon friend the member for dartford jim dickson about the way in which the shadow minister have make an astonishing about turn have call for strong regulation he now call for weak regulation interruption if he do not want to listen to my word perhaps can let he listen to his own follow year of misery and uncertainty for fan welcome the news on an independent football regulator will the minister assure my constituent that the regulator will have sufficient power to deal with regulatory breach and strengthen those ownership report february vol well prefer his early work let say that although the shadow secretary of state no long back his own bill and will not act this government will let turn to something that be very close to my heart the experience that be give voice by many member today include my hon friend the members for crewe and nantwich connor naismith for dartford and for derby south baggy shanker and especially my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang who have be tireless champion for read through very difficult time she say let reading be the last and she be absolutely right in the year that football fan have wait for this piece of legislation to come on to the statute book and for the promise from all those year ago to be make good too many people have experience the hell that she and so many other have be through it be only fitting that finish with reference to my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale lizzi collinge who have be tireless in her defence of her club and her town have the privilege of go to morecambe to meet the shrimps and the board which she rightly reference and which have do so much for the club she outline the impact more powerfully than any of we could as well as the strength of feeling about owner who refuse to sell their club even when the impact of that would be to bring those proud club to the verge of collapse it have be privilege to work closely with she although wish it have be on something more positive as know she do want to make it clear from this dispatch box that this government take very dim view of owner who treat our club as plaything rather than as the custodian that they be thank my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale and all the member of this house or most of the member of this house for constructive debate commend the bill to the house order have lower the temperature trust that can now rely on the shadow minister to maintain the lower temperature if not might have to intervene with leave of the house it be my pleasure to sum up this report stage we have hear today that there be common ground on many of the issue face football but as highlight in my opening speech we disagree on the solution this be government who be currently under investigation for appoint labour crony to chair an independent football regulator they may not like it but that be the reality our amendment seek to end the politicisation of such role and to ensure transparency on future appointment we believe strongly that no member would vote this measure down give that it seek to end cronyism over club and favour over fan new clause would deal with alcohol at football ground as we have hear in the debate and we have support from the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford and from the liberal democrats we believe this ban be outdate football fan should not be treat with two tier approach when it come to be able to drink in the stand we will be press this new clause to division because we on the opposition benches be on the side of football fan we do not want this nanny state approach to continue we want to make sure that football fan be treat with the respect that they deserve and we will see tonight whose side this government be really on question put that the clause be read

football fan have be force to endure for far too long we have have four year of promise and today we make good on those commitment pay tribute to my hon friend the member for barnsley south stephanie peacock the minister for sport and baroness twycross who have steer this bill expertly and with care to get we to this place thank the civil servant in my department who have work tirelessly for many year to get to this point and particularly thank the bill policy and legal team who will be as relieve and delighted as anybody to see this bill finally become law also thank the many parliamentarian who have work so hard with we all to get this bill into well shape particularly by strengthen the provision for fan in order to put they back at the heart of the game and to improve the backstop process this be light touch regulator that will help to enhance the game and be really grateful to all those parliamentarian for their support pay tribute to somebody who have become not just an inspiration for lot of football fan around the country but friend to we all dame tracey crouch her fan lead review highlight how too many football fan have be leave with nowhere to turn when face with reckless owner financial mismanagement and threat to their club very existence her dedication and expertise have be integral to get we to where we be today although be sad that be unable to pay tribute to the shadow minister the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew who steer the bill through its first stage under the last government and who no long support his own legislation want to acknowledge that from the outset it have be cross party effort to stand by football fan the length and breadth of our country finally want to address our football fan who be the good in the world we be do this for you because for too long you have be treat as an afterthought at good or as nuisance at bad in game that be only great because of you this bill be for macclesfield for wigan for bury for bolton for derby for reading for sheffield wednesday for morecambe and for many many more club that have have to endure the misery of be put last when they should have be put first we promise in our manifesto that we would end year of inaction and make the change for which fan have fight for so long and which be so overdue be proud to be part of the win team that have put our fan back on the pitch and at the heart of the game where they belong call the shadow minister here we be the final opportunity for the government and this house to trigger var review before english football fan and the beautiful game be leave in tear we can not support this expand bill as draft and we believe that pass it tonight risk harm the very game that it claim to protect we all largely agree on the problem in football we have minority of greedy owner with loyal fan leave powerless when proud club be tear apart for profit or by reckless management no one in this house want to see another bury or macclesfield but let we be clear and honest with fan this bill will not stop bad owner damage club market failure will not be remove and club will not be bail out by this government the risk of breakaway league will now grow not shrink this bill risk replace financial mismanagement with political interference poor governance with endless red tape and the soul of our game with new quango that grow year by year unchallenged by real scrutiny or accountability to parliament or fan if we vote this bill through tonight we will not remove unaccountable owner we will only create more unaccountable bureaucrat this amateur government will strangle the growth of great british success story rather than enable it while reform still struggle to manage its five side team after yet another scandal sorry four side now english football do not belong to politician it belong to the fan in the stand the volunteer in the clubhouse and the kid pull on the shirt for the first time on sunday morning yet this bill open the door for mission creep on an extraordinary scale with provision that would let any future minister expand the regulator power and the league cover at will as draft this bill risk breach fifa and uefa clear rule against government overreach put our club and national side in danger of sanction that would shame the country on the world stage it set up powerful new regulator with vast discretion but precious little real democratic control and it pile on cost that small club and fan simply can not bear if the minister think that big club will pay for this quango alone she need to read her own impact report ultimately the fan always pay through high ticket price and high merchandise price all to stand on the same terrace on which generation have previously stand the test of good law be whether it solve problem proportionately and properly not whether it let ministers feel that they have do something this bill fail that test and fail it spectacularly it treat our national game not as living tradition root in local pride but as an industry to be micromanage by the state this be not how english football be build and it be not how it will be sustain on behalf of his majesty official opposition say clearly tonight that football be at its good when the player entertain the crowd and the referee go unnoticed but this bill risk create more referee than player referee who answer not to club or supporter but to labour ministers and mandarin if this bill pass and we expect it will tonight can confirm to the house and to fan at home that future conservative government will trigger review of labour regulator as soon as possible and if it be overreach and strangle order we do not need any more of that disruption if the regulator be overreach and strangle club with unnecessary red tape as we believe it will under this government we will act decisively on behalf of fan to promote the english game again the real threat to football future be not lack of regulator it be the erosion of competition and trust between owner community and supporter we would fix that with strong transparency rule such as the rule that labour members have just vote against as well as the well enforcement of exist law and real fan power not vast new quango lead by labour crony work three day week on salary of this shameful labour government be already under investigation have once again put their party first with crony over club favour over fan and greed over the beautiful game tonight the conservatives will be vote against this bill in good conscience because our national game deserve well than government whose only knowledge of football be free ticket and corporate prawn sandwich it be worth note that labour members have tonight vote against fan have drink on the terrace while their minister drink alcohol in their corporate hospitality box for free we will continue to stand up for the fan not the bureaucrat create an even large nanny state we will continue to stand up for healthy competition and local pride not one size fit all state interference that will relegate english football among global competition we will be ready to revisit this when as be likely it fail to deliver the promise be make and to review it to rein it in to scrap it altogether and to give power back to our sporting body that be the ultimate goal of the fan lead review as labour members would know if they have read it football belong to the fan and no badly draft act of parliament should ever make we forget that interruption they think it all over well it will be for you know who you be laughter question put that the bill be now read the third time jack abbott debbie abrahams shockat adam zubir ahmed luke akehurst bayo alaba douglas

measure in place at the time and the broad regulatory environment for child participate in combat sport commend the hon gentleman this be very difficult subject and he be speak with admirable compassion and understanding be sure the family appreciate that do the hon gentleman agree that while there be moral duty and legal obligation to protect child and young people in sport through the creation and promotion of safe environment that protect they from harm each sport have different requirement when it come to fulfil that obligation while it be reasonable that football coach do not need to lay hand on child in any case it be also reasonable that karate instructor must position child and that must require regulation and government action do the hon member agree that there must be sport by sport approach to safeguarding and regulation be grateful to the hon member for be here tonight and know that the family will be grateful for the interest he have show will go on to talk about the lack of regulation and what the family be call for know that the family would want to thank the coroner in this inquest michael pemberton for his approach to alex case he describe the match that alex be part of as chaotic and somewhat disjointed there be no national governing body oversight and no clear or enforce safety standard gordon mitchell head of welfare and governance at kickboxing gb tell the inquest that the organisation would never sanction light contact bout in ring he explain that such match be permit only on mat where mitigate factor such as fighter step off the mat allow referee to step in in the event of mismatch or escalating risk on the broad framework govern child participation in combat sport the inqu hear that standard around safety medical oversight and safeguarding vary widely and in many case be absent all together in the word of the coroner the level of confidence in organisational safeguard that people would expect to exist within the sport be sadly lack if match be unofficial or unsanctioned there be no guideline minimum standard that must be meet to provide safeguarding for child participant no minimum standard of medical support that might be require no maximum round no period of rest no welfare check on participant and no risk assessment and critical incident plan it should stop we all in our track to learn that in this country child can be place in combat situation without clear enforceable national protection alex family do everything right everything love family would do they encourage he to get involve in range of sport and activity and support he when it become clear that he have talent for kickboxe they enable he to thrive in what he love do and to become six time world champion however as the inquest make clear they and alex be fail by lack of safeguarding responsibility and regulation every single day child up and down the country take part in activity like alex do they lace up glove put on headgear and step into training hall and ring with no minimum standard in place to ensure their safety parent who just want the good for their child and who want they to be fit and healthy to enjoy sport and to discover and nurture their talent be send their child to participate in contact sport without realise the risk many people do not know that there be sanction and unsanctioned bout or what that mean in term of safety many people do not know that there be no one govern body for kickboxe and that membership be not mandatory that be the shocking reality expose by the inquest into alex death it be the reason the coroner take the highly unusual step of issue to the department for culture media and sport regulation prevention of future death report before the inquest have conclude in that report he raise concern that there be no guidance or regulation of contact sport involve child participation he say that action should be take to prevent future death and that the government have the power to take such action welcome the fact that the secretary of state have task her department with explore way to urgently improve the safety and welfare of child in martial art and combat sport and to ensure that it be always priority urgent action must follow and would be grateful for any further update that the minister can provide today what alex family be demand be simple clear enforceable national protection for child in combat sport that would replace the current patchwork in which there be no consistency in rule no oversight and no accountability from this tragedy well system must emerge we owe it to alex and to his family we owe it to every parent who believe in good faith that their child be protect by the rule operate around sport and we owe it to every child who step into ring or on to mat trust that the adult around they be keep they safe no child should lose their life participate in sport they love finish with the word of alex parent our life have be change forever alex future be take and with it part of ours too we miss he every second now all we have leave be memory but we also have the responsibility to make sure his death be not in vain and for his sake we will make sure we do that we can not bring alex back but we can ensure that his legacy be one that prevent such tragedy from ever happen again be grateful to my hon friend the member for liverpool walton dan carden for secure this important debate and for his move speech the death of his constituent alexander eastwood as result of kickboxe bout be devastating know that my hon friend care deeply about child safeguarding and can reassure he and the house that it be priority for this government he advocate with care and think for his constituent make powerful and move speech one that have hear very clearly in the time available to will set out the government plan to strengthen safeguarding for child in combat sport will begin by outline key safeguarding issue in those sport then will set

clear that more need to be do to protect the safety of child in combat sport ahead of the inquest into the death of alexander eastwood the assistant coroner for manchester west file regulation report to prevent future death the report highlight specific area of concern for child in martial art in her response the secretary of state for culture media and sport set out plan to work with the martial art sector to address those concern in consider our next step we must take account of the entire martial art sector and its complexity the sector be make up of many different discipline include judo taekwondo kickboxing and more many though not all of these discipline have publicly fund national governing body many provider across the sector have robust safety measure in place national govern body set minimum safeguarding standard for their affiliated club and competition to comply with these standard be in line with guidance issue by sport england our arm length body for grassroots sport many club and competition be not affiliate with publicly fund governing body however many unaffiliated provider choose to sign up to the safeguard code in martial art organisation such as the british martial arts and boxing association support unaffiliated martial art provider to adopt the safeguard code the code be fund by sport england and recognise club and association that demonstrate strong safeguarding practice against set of minimum standard provider with recognition under the code can display logo on their promotional material to show participant that their safety measure have be vet the coroner report on the case of alexander eastwood highlight specific issue around club and competition that be not affiliate with national govern body we be now look into that as matter of urgency the coroner identify that without set standard club and competition may not have adequate regulation around medical check and support the number of round and period of rest participant welfare check and critical incident plan despite the programme in place to support robust safeguarding practice in martial art unaffiliated provider be not require to meet any share safety standard recognise that coach and provider work hard to make martial art available to community across the country and recognise the work do by club and association to comply with the safeguard code in martial art but there must be strong consistent standard for safeguard child across all martial art clearly more must be do club and competition across martial art should share consistent standard for safeguard child parent and carer should be able to trust that appropriate safety measure be in place regardless of where their child participate exist safety standard for martial art set by sport england and its partner must be robust and fit for purpose but national standard must also translate into strong safety practice across all martial art the sector should look to encourage as many club as possible to adopt share safety standard the government will consider what more can be do in this space parent and carer deserve to be able to make informed decision about where their child participate in martial art information on good safety practice and which club and competition meet share standard should be readily available to participant and their guardian of course the burden of find information should not only lie with participant and their guardian club and competition with robust safety practice should be support to promote the standard they meet the government be look at all these area to assess what more can be do to safeguard child in combat sport as promise in her response to the coroner report the secretary of state will meet the family of alexander eastwood to hear about their experience and view and to discuss our thinking before we go into more detail publicly hope everyone can appreciate why that approach be be take in addition in response to the coroner report on this case my department have task sport england with work with the martial art sector on this issue it will identify improvement and present plan in the come month that work will include develop guidance for the

that participant parent and carer can have confidence in many martial art provider work hard to safeguard child who participate under their supervision and there be strong safety practice in place across many area of combat sport but more must be do to ensure that safety standard be strong consistent and transparent standard of practice should be robust and widely adopt across the sector and it should be clear to parent and carer which club and competition comply with share standard and which do not nothing can bring alexander back but as the secretary of state say to before the debate we be
