know indeed canvass many of they during the campaign and have already be pick up casework in the corridor we be an amazing community with fantastic campaigner and organisation business entrepreneur charity heritage music park and school there be so much go for it but there be also deep inequality that have widen in recent year there be now year gap in life expectancy between woman bear in notting dale in north kensington and one bear in holland park only third of mile away that gap that have increase by five year in the past decade alone over child be live in poverty and over family be on grow housing waiting list we be rightly proud of our contribution to the nation economy in term of growth talent innovation and finance in so many different industry and we celebrate the tourist who come to visit our museum portobello road and our park but we must also tackle the underlying cause of the inequality that prevent too many people in my constituency from reach their full potential whether they be housing education or employment opportunity know from the thousand of people have meet across our constituency that far too many feel like government be not work for they they see too many politician put political party before country and self interest before community know that trust in government and politician have plummet as result but it do not have to be this way have spend my career work to make democracy work well in dozen of country around the world by support reformer in government to work with civil society to be more transparent more inclusive and more accountable and to deliver for people on the priority that they care about in kensington and bayswater that mean for example get grip on the dirty money in luxury property that still stain our community despite recent progress in legislation and despite the leadership that baroness hodge the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and many other have show on this topic we still have in our constituency one of the high number of anonymously own property register in tax haven with loophole allow autocrat and kleptocrat to continue shield their ownership many of those property sit empty hurt our local business and school and hollow out our sense of community agree that those that be freeze under sanction should be utilise as soon as possible so be determined to build on our kensington against dirty money campaign and continue advocate for london to end its reputation as the dirty money capital of the world and instead become the anti corruption capital of the world there be no bad example of what happen when government stop listen to people and when transparency and accountability be discard than what happen at grenfell tower over seven year ago seventy two people lose their life in an entirely preventable tragedy yet we still do not have truth justice and change for the bereaved survivor and affected community these be people whose life be change forever on june and who have have to wait far too long for justice and for those responsible to be hold to account in the come week the second phase of the public inquiry will report know that hon member here will join in look to those recommendation to ensure that tragedy like grenfell can never happen again warmly welcome the inclusion in the king speech of the duty of candour law for public servant applaud the effective campaigning of those affect by grenfell hillsborough infect blood and windrush and of other who have suffer because of an unacceptable defensive culture across many of our public institution hope we can look at further measure to ensure robust oversight of the implementation of the recommendation from those inquiry kensington and bayswater be special place make huge contribution to our national life in so many way my hope be that under this labour government we will become fairer place too build on our strength and address the inequality that have hold we back it will not be easy and it will not happen overnight as qpr fan have learn over many year to be realistic but we have an opportunity now to restore faith and trust in government and democracy and to restore our reputation internationally too
