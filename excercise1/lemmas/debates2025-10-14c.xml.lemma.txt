oral answers to questions energy security and net zero the secretary of state be ask net zero evidence base policy what step he be take to ensure scientific evidence be use to support his net zero policy this government approach be found on the bedrock of the well scientific evidence which accord to the intergovernmental panel on climate change say that net zero by be essential to limit global warming to that be why we support baroness may decision to put net zero by into law that be base on advice from the climate change committee that decision be right for the climate for energy security and for the job and growth that it can bring to our country this government mission to make britain clean energy superpower be not only deliver against climate target but deliver job and investment in place like durham and the wide north east where around renewable energy company already employ around people in good quality job figure that be set to rise to those who take stand against climate action would put that growth at risk do the secretary of state share my concern that the fearmongering by some in this house about the cost and safety of renewable be not only misguided but fundamentally against our national interest and will he work with local team to provide suitable knowledge and education as suggest by retrofit reimagined order think the secretary of state have get it my hon friend be absolutely right unfortunately the climate change act be now an issue that divide this house think rain newton smith the director general of the cbi put it very well recently when she say the climate act have be the bedrock for investment flow into the uk rip up the framework that have give investor confidence that the uk be serious about sustainable growth through low carbon future would damage our economy seek to abolish the climate change act be not just betrayal of young people it be anti job and anti investment may gently remind the energy secretary that it be his job to answer question from mps on behalf of their constituent will ask the same question that ask he last time if the uk become net zero tomorrow by how much would it reduce the earth temperature will give the hon gentleman the answer give he last time action by the uk make difference here of course we be of global emission but our action mean that other country act where be the evidence for that well it actually happen when the climate change act pass other country pass their own version of it net zero be sign into law in this country and now of global gdp be cover by net zero that be the difference the uk make believe in britain the hon gentleman do not call the chair of the energy security and net zero committee lord stern remind we just today that investment in climate action be the growth story of the century while expect growth from fossil fuel be futile because the damage it cause end in self destruction the office for budget responsibility confirm the same thing in the summer refer to the huge cost of not take climate action be it not the truth that the energy transition be essential not only to address climate action but to exactly how we deliver economic success the chair of the select committee speak very wisely on this matter the net zero economy grow three time fast than the economy as whole last year this be the growth opportunity of the century now we could let china or india take that opportunity but say that we need that opportunity for britain the climate change act force ministers to meet rigid legally bind emission target regardless of the economic consequence do the secretary of state accept that this law have directly contribute to high energy bill the loss of british industry and decline competitiveness and that the only sensible course of action be to repeal it no and british business roundly condemn the conservatives when they come out with that argument the hon gentleman should have word with the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho sit on the front bench who say just in march last year life come at you fast mr speaker that britain be the poster child for net zero she be laud everything associate with that and now she want to abolish the act that make it possible energy infrastructure applications land use changes what plan he have to assess land use change in application for new energy infrastructure we be deliver strategic spatial energy plan to support more actively plan approach to energy infrastructure it will consider wide demand include food production water supply and nature recovery the departments for environment food and rural affairs and for energy security and net zero will ensure that the strategic spatial energy plan and the land use framework work together resident in my constituency be concerned about propose site for battery energy storage system on agricultural land in the green belt with tale of similar storage system catch fire there be understandable fear in the community would the minister meet to discuss make local fire service statutory consultee for certain type of battery storage planning application and to hear my resident concern and will he reassure they that they will not be guinea pig for new or untested technology the hon lady be right to say that public confidence in the safety of all infrastructure be incredibly important battery technology be no more unsafe than any other technology but if there be public perception that it be then it be right that we take action to deal with that that be why be host roundtable to look at what more we can do around safety and it be why the department for environment food and rural affairs be do work on some of the regulation in this space this be regulate closely by the health and safety executive but be happy to meet the hon lady to discuss what more we can do thank the minister for that answer in my constituency several planning application be pende and one have already be grant in the village of wilsden and cullingworth for battery storage and onshore wind in the wide area can the minister explain how constituent with clean energy infrastructure in their area can benefit from both cheap bill and community funding my hon friend be right to highlight that building renewable infrastructure be how we will bring down bill for everyone in the long term it be incredibly important that we can store cheap electricity include through battery storage so that we can deploy it in the system far more regularly than we be currently deploy gas which be what be drive up people bill we also want the community that host the infrastructure to benefit directly from it they will benefit from cheap bill as well as from direct community benefit we have be consult over the past few month on whether those should be make mandatory and whether we should raise the expectation on developer fuel poverty greater manchester what step his department be take to tackle fuel poverty in greater manchester ensure that everyone have access to safe and warm home be our priority from this winter we estimate that an extra family in the north west will receive off their energy bill thank to decision take by this government through our warm home plan we will bring down bill for family right across the country accord to national energy action adult in the north be more likely to ration their energy this winter and in my constituency almost people be in fuel poverty and at risk of poor living condition illness and suffering balance must be strike to deliver both clean heating and people first approach after serious delay will the minister finally bring forward warm home plan and explain how it will achieve that balance and ensure that low income household in cheadle be guarantee clean affordable heating for the winter to come we will bring forward the warm home plan this year in march we allocate around billion to local authority and social housing provider through the warm home local grant the hon member may want to direct his constituent to the greater manchester combine authority which receive settlement of million of devolve capital funding for building retrofit they can access that through the retrofit portal which have an eligibility checker so that household can check whether they qualify for free or discount home upgrade warm home discount fuel poverty what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount on level of fuel poverty what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount on level of fuel poverty from this winter an additional million household across the uk will receive off their energy bill which make total of nearly million low income household receive this vital support that be the difference that this government be make to our community be delighted that thank to this government and the warm home discount eligibility extension thousand more rochdale family will be eligible for off their bill this winter it will ensure that young and old alike get more help with their bill this winter would like to raise the case of my constituent keith gumbridge who have his cavity wall insulation botch under the previous government and who be leave with huge legal bill after so call no win no fee law firm pure legal go bust mr gumbridge case have be with the legal ombudsman for nearly three year do the minister agree that that be far too long to wait for justice pay tribute to my hon friend for all his work championing cause for his constituent he will know that an extra household in the north west will be eligible for the warm home discount and that million household across the country will be help this year would be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the case of mr gumbridge ensure confidence in the insulation system will be crucial to roll out the warm home plan congratulate the minister on be free from the government whips office and welcome he to his position on the front bench commend the government on extend the warm home discount to further million low income household but there be much more to do with that in mind will the minister find time to meet so that we can discuss how we can keep people in newcastle under lyme alive safe and warm in the colder month ahead thank my hon friend for his comment on my liberation from the government whips office know that he be champion for his constituent in newcastle under lyme and be always happy to meet to discuss these important issue he will know as do that with wholesale gas cost high than before the russian invasion of ukraine we must get people off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel price and on to clean home grow power nearly million household in the uk live in fuel poverty at the same time recent report from the common wealth think tank tell we that energy company profit average about quarter of everybody bill in the last few year billion have be pay to shareholder instead of be reinveste or use to help tackle fuel poverty will the minister commit to tackle those energy company profit by tax they fairly and reinveste the money in the urgent work that be need for example through the warm home plan to tackle the scourge of fuel poverty in our country the cost of energy have to come down and one of my job as minister for energy consumer be drive down the cost of bill but we must also remember that the government introduce windfall tax on the oil and gas company and we have the price cap on energy which cap the profit of energy company we will continue to take that action despite the oil price be at six month low this week energy price remain stubbornly high give the onset of winter what further step will the minister and his department take by way of warm home scheme we be take action through the warm home discount which be be provide to an extra million household across the country and the warm home plan which we will roll out before the end of the year energy price economic growth what assessment he have make of the potential impact of trend in the level of energy price on economic growth high and volatile energy price be bad for growth take money out of consumer pocket and make our business less competitive through our mission to achieve clean power by we be take the country off the rollercoaster of global fossil fuel price and have set route to home grow cheap and greener energy the minister and come from one of the most energy rich part of europe yet its consumer have among the high energy bill in europe that drive up fuel poverty and hit the cost of living crisis he will be aware of that labour promise to bring down bill by they will have go up by about the same amount do the minister understand why people be so frustrated with the government like the hon member understand people frustration when they look at their energy bill each month interruption that promise stand that be why we be take concert action through the warm home discount which be provide million household with support this winter and the warm home plan which we will roll out this year economic growth be key driver for all our constituent what be the government estimate of the number of job that will be create in the uk by be it true to say that it will be triple the number in the old economy hundred of thousand of job will come from the clean power revolution that be why it be so important that we push ahead with it and do not adopt the tactic of the conservative party or their friend on the back benches we need to push ahead with clean power in order to unlock those hundred of thousand of job across the country call the shadow secretary of state welcome the new ministers to the front bench on the first day of recess away from scrutiny the labour party publish the price for its allocation round of the renewable auction labour use to say that renewable be nine time cheap but the price that the secretary of state have say he be willing to pay be high than the current cost of electricity they be the high price in decade and he have extend the contract length to year those be not just the price that we will be pay they be the price that our child will be pay will the minister explain how lock we into high price for long will cut bill by the right hon lady comparison be absolute nonsense and she know it she compare the cost of build and operate new renewable which be what the contract for difference relate to with the cost of operate not build gas plant once we make fair comparison the truth be that renewable be cheap to build we will take no lesson on energy policy from the conservative party which abandon its commitment to clean energy at its party conference great british energy public sector renewable energy use what step great british energy be take to help public service use more renewable energy what step great british energy be take to help public service use more renewable energy what step great british energy be take to help public service use more renewable energy early this month great british energy jointly fund new community energy project in scotland include an island solar farm community ice rink and small community wind farm great british energy be also help public service in england with their energy bill through its solar for all programme which benefit school and hospital in this way gbe be transfer money from the pocket of energy company to local community and frontline service many leisure centre such as the tryst in cumbernauld which be build and open in be desperate to decarbonise but face huge cost and the practical challenge of retrofit renewable technology into old building will my right hon friend set out how great british energy will support vital community facility of that kind in make the switch to clean energy and in reduce their bill my hon friend speak very well about these issue gb energy be already take advantage of the huge potential of clean energy and hundred of school hospital and nhs site across the country be already benefit the statement of strategic priority make it clear that gbe will work collaboratively and in partnership with scottish public body and the scottish government to increase investment in the local community energy sector in scotland organisation such as my hon friend leisure centre sound like ideal candidate thank to great british energy and this government queen hospital in burton will get solar panel which will save the trust money that can be plough directly into the frontline and be spend on patient do the secretary of state agree that there be significant opportunity to expand that programme to other public building and be he explore that with his department my hon friend be right and hope that the massive expansion to school and hospital that we have already ensure in month be welcome across the house they do not need gbe to do it the hon gentleman say that we do not need gb energy to do that but the conservatives never do it not in year it be precisely through publicly own energy company that we be do this to the benefit of citizen across our country agree with my hon friend the member for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier that there be huge opportunity here and we intend to expand the plan for one welcome the announcement that the publicly own great british energy will roll out solar panel to more school and hospital in the come year what benefit will that bring to our community and what can place such as luton south and south bedfordshire do to take advantage of the clean power transition this be really important public institution face significantly high energy bill because of the legacy of the last government gbe with its programme be cut those bill that be transfer of resource from energy bill to frontline public service the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie be chuntere from the front bench he should visit some of the teacher and nhs staff who think that this be brilliant programme my constituency of esher and walton be home to the uk large float installation of solar panel there be on the queen elizabeth ii reservoir help to support public service by power thames water treatment plant it be fantastically innovative renewable project but very few of my constituent know about it how will the government use great british energy to argue more effectively for the benefit of renewable for community and public service across the uk the energy minister say that he go on profile raise visit to the programme two week ago so many more people now know about it thank to that indeed even more thousand million will know about it as result of watch this question time the hon lady make an important point about how gb energy can roll this out across the country and float solar have real potential as well over year ago the uk government promise that there would be hundred of job for gb energy in aberdeen year on the oil and gas industry in aberdeen be haemorrhage thousand of job and we be barely into double figure for gb energy job when will that promise be keep have to say that do not agree with the hon gentleman about the work that gb energy be do when talk to industry representative they say that gb energy now play crucial role there be investment come into the supply chain supply chain fund of billion thank to the spending review which the conservatives would abolish because they do not seem to want job in britain there be billion in the supply chain and gb energy be roll out community energy project in school and hospital in england as well as the one in scotland that have talk about gb energy be partner with the private sector this be all part of the clean energy workforce plan which we will publish soon for extra job as result of our clean energy mission by prioritise partnership with school we will help to protect their budget draw the secretary of state attention to school in maidenhead and specifically furze platt senior school where happen to be governor which recently partner with maidenergy to install solar panel on the school building thereby do right by its budget and by the environment and set great example for the student teach there congratulate the hon gentleman on be school governor and on the work the school be do we can talk about the tangible benefit but the wide point be that young people want we to act on these issue and that be part of have an education system that teach they about the benefit of move towards clean energy when go into school there be massive enthusiasm for that kind of initiative net zero impact on manufacturing what assessment he have make of the potential impact of his department net zero policy on the manufacturing industry be delighted that my first outing at the dispatch box be to answer question from my hon friend and on topic that we have work on so much over the past year we on the labour side know that net zero be the great economic opportunity of our generation unlike the previous conservative government which allow industry to wither we do not accept that decarbonisation mean deindustrialisation through our modern industrial strategy we be work with business to help it to invest grow and meet our climate ambition congratulate the minister on his well deserve elevation to the front bench he have work quite hard with the ceramic sector on this issue energy intensive industry such as ceramic be at the mercy of an international gas market over which very few country have direct control but one of the thing that could help be look at electricity cost may therefore encourage the minister in his new role to consider expand eligibility for the supercharger scheme so that energy intensive industry such as ceramic can benefit from the support available until the supercharger scheme come online in my hon friend raise an important point about the scope of the supercharger which we be go to look at in he will be aware that some part of the ceramics supply chain can access the supercharger but too be concerned about the impact of high energy cost on the ceramics sector will meet the head of ceramics uk this month be chair meeting of the energy intensive users group and look forward to further engagement with the sector in the new year welcome the minister to his place talk about industry the lindsey oil refinery in lincolnshire be in receivership and be currently be sell but thousand and thousand of job be at risk and the worker there be desperately concerned that the department for energy security and net zero and the official receiver be not run proper process frustrating potential bidder for the whole site will the minister in his new job commit to help ensure that the whole site be sell to successful bidder the hon member say that thousand and thousand of job be at risk in this country they be at risk from the climate deny policy of reform the institution of chemical engineers report last week that there be job in the green economy in this country thousand and thousand in the constituency of every single member in this house and the hon member party be put that investment at risk call the shadow minister how many job have to be sacrifice on the altar of this secretary of state vainglorious eco zealotry before the government acknowledge the utter destruction of the uk industrial base that be be wreak by policy drive by an out of touch green lobby that have capture what be laughably still call the department for energy security it be no wonder that there be so much laughter around the chamber because the policy of the previous conservative government see industry decline they be prepared to let industry decline because fundamentally they do not believe in industry and now we find that they do not believe in climate science we on this side of the house know that we can achieve decarbonisation in this country by win investment from industry investment that be come in from all around the world our policy be give industry the confidence to invest in create job here in the uk on their watch two oil refinery have close in just one year with jim ratcliffe warn of million job loss to come thousand be be lay off in the north sea as company divest themselves of asset and investment dry up factory be close and plant be shut down it be no wonder that the head of unite the union be call for the secretary of state to be sack we know that the prime minister try to do that but fail so short of that will they instead consider our plan which would save industry and job scrap the climate change act scrap the levy scrap the windfall tax and put cheap energy first would like to thank the minister for remind the house of the litany of error that we have to pick up when we come into office my portfolio be fill with company that have struggle so much over the past year but those company now find that they have partner in government who will work with they to attract the investment to build job in the uk if the opposition do not like those job they can continue as they be grid infrastructure what step he be take to improve grid infrastructure we be build resilient grid for the future after decade of under investment we be halve the development time for new transmission infrastructure include through reform to planning regulation and supply chain and deliver the grid capacity need to deliver clean power by and the economic growth that this country need in january when storm éowyn hit the uk hundred of thousand of people across scotland be without power for several day that include thousand of my constituent in rural village such as oakley and blairhall and number be reliant on power for critical medical equipment engineer perform heroic work to restore power as quickly as possible but that be delay by outdated grid infrastructure as the new winter storm season have already begin this year what step be the minister and the department take to ensure the future reliance of the grid to withstand worsen storm how can that be do to protect vulnerable people in my constituency and across the uk my hon friend ask an incredibly important question first would like to thank all the engineer and customer service staff who work through the recent storm amy to ensure that people be reconnecte as quickly as possible include in some incredibly difficult circumstance they do fantastic job we be try to ensure that the uk grid remain as resilient as possible that require investment and those who oppose the building of new infrastructure to improve our grid resilience will need to explain to their constituent why they want they to be much more at risk of disconnection in those storm secondly these storm be become more common because climate change be impact all our life the answer be to move more quickly towards clean power and to recognise that climate change be problem not to bury our head in the sand and fail to deliver the necessary investment proposal for mile of pylon from grimsby to walpole in my constituency would have major detrimental impact on rural area due to the scale of the infrastructure the loss of high quality farmland and the proximity of the infrastructure to home do the minister understand do not think he do why local people say no to pylon will he get national grid to look properly at undergrounding or offshore to reduce the impact on these community and ensure that if the proposal do go ahead community be properly compensate could not have organise that well if have try immediately after say if you be against grid infrastructure you be against economic growth up pop the hon gentleman to make exactly that point his party be against build the future of this country and we be not go to follow that path at all decade of under investment have lead to the issue we face today they hold back economic growth across the country this infrastructure have to be build somewhere we be determined that community benefit from that by introduce what the previous government fail to do community benefit for the community who be host the infrastructure call the shadow minister on grid infrastructure the chinese wind turbine manufacturer ming yang have say that it be look to set up wind turbine factory in scotland our security service have warn we about the risk of chinese state sponsor hacker try to infiltrate and destroy energy system in the west and hide kill switch have be find in chinese solar installation technology in the united states can the minister provide the house with very clear assurance that neither ming yang nor the chinese state will be able to remotely control our energy infrastructure yes or no first will take no lesson from the party that bring chinese investor right into build our nuclear power station this government be deliver nuclear power station with british government funding not chinese funding so will take no lesson from the conservatives on that many company want to come and invest in the uk and we absolutely welcome investment into this country but every single decision and investment obviously have to pass stringent national security test will not engage right now in what those test will be but we will say very clearly that no decision we make will ever compromise our national security carbon budget delivery plan what step he be take to ensure the forthcoming carbon budget delivery plan include measure to financially support people on low and middle income welcome minister thank you mr speaker thank the hon lady for her continued advocacy on this agenda have enjoy work with she from the back benches and hope to continue to do so in this new post be excited to share with she and the whole house the carbon budget growth and delivery plan later this month what can say now be that ensure that low and middle income family can benefit from the energy transition be absolutely central to our mission it be why we be roll out the big home upgrade scheme in generation and why we be move away from expensive fossil fuel towards cheap clean british power in home and community across our country welcome the minister to her new position and thank she for her answer know how much she will want the new carbon budget delivery plan to reflect the scale of ambition require while ensure that the poor be not ask to pay the price and also to signal that it be an absolute priority across government can she assure we that the new plan will not just be slip out but will be launch properly and crucially with the prime minister it be slightly above my pay grade to determine the prime minister diary but can assure the hon lady that we will proudly launch the carbon budget growth and delivery plan later this month tackle climate change international co operation what step he be take to increase co operation with other country to tackle climate change what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on tackle climate change in the good tradition of the uk we see it as our duty to work with other country to tackle the climate crisis and protect future generation it be british leadership that see the climate change act emulate in country across the world and it be the leadership of the uk at that now see of global gdp cover by net zero we will maintain that tradition of leadership into in brazil and beyond the amazon rainforest be the lung of the earth but it be gasp for breath be pleased that will be in the heart of the amazon ella school student from my constituency would like to know what step the government will be take to stop deforestation and back nature base solution on behalf of ella may urge the secretary of state to go as far as possible and do all he can thank my hon friend for his question and ella for her interest in and enthusiasm for this incredibly important issue deforestation be terrible thing for the planet but it be also terrible for the people who be affect the indigenous people who live in the forest nature base solution and solution that put indigenous people at the centre make huge difference this be cop in the forest and think the brazilian presidency deserve congratulation on that emphasis it be develop number of initiative include the so call tfff the tropical forest forever facility to finance the prevention of deforestation and we be work with it on that young people in my constituency of wolverhampton west be particularly concerned about protect the environment and the future of our planet have be contact by student at wolverhampton girl high school and st edmund catholic academy and recently be proud to attend climate justice art exhibition prepare by pupil at st teresa catholic primary academy what step be we take to encourage international awareness of the danger of global warming and the need to recycle and limit plastic waste thereby also reduce marine pollution plastic waste be something that my colleague in the department for environment food and rural affairs work on think my hon friend wide point be important there be global context to this and sometimes that context might not actually be as it appear which be that when we look across the world we see that country be still act on these issue why because they recognise that it be in their national interest economically and in the long term for future generation there be no future if people bury their head in the sand and say we not go to act begin next month in brazil the uk must play lead role on the world stage to tackle climate change at home however somerset council be hamper in its attempt to achieve net zero by an escalate financial crisis follow the maladministration of its previous conservative administration what step will the minister and cabinet colleague take to support council in their net zero transition part of what we be do be devolve more of the funding around warm home for example so that local authority can play lead role congratulate local authority on the interest that they be take in this the hon lady raise the wide picture of which be important this be crucial moment the uk have already show leadership in the past month include by publish our nationally determine contribution at last year thank the secretary of state very much for his answer the fact be that we be all in this together we must understand that third world country have role to play just as the united kingdom do but we be the rich country be conscious that it may not always be financially possible for third world country to do the thing that we ask they to so what assistance can we give they to ensure that when we approach the task of do this together we actually achieve it together welcome the hon gentleman question part of the answer here be that the economic have change so get private finance into develop country can make massive difference the baku to belém road map be be produce as part of the cop process it be trillion road map and most of that be about private finance we can see across the world the effect of private finance in develop country in pakistan for example solar have go from play almost no part in its electricity system to be the top part of that system in only three or four year because it be in pakistan economic interest that be what we be see across the world we need the private and public sector to play their role emission reduction progress report what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the climate change committee report entitle progress in reduce emission thank my hon friend for repeatedly raise these issue in the house know that climate change be of huge concern to she and her constituent be proud that britain have lead the way with our independent committee on climate change establish under the climate change act which have work effectively for nearly two decade under leadership from labour and the conservatives sincerely hope that we can re establish that consensus we be grateful to the committee for its scientific recommendation to the department obviously it be for the department now to consider they and we will report back on our decision at the end of the month welcome the minister to her place it be good to see she among the line of man on the treasury bench have just finish chair meeting of the housing communities and local government committee one issue that we discuss be decent home standard emission from home be another key area that we need to bear down on give the government priority of improve minimum energy performance certificate standard by appreciate that the minister have be in post for only few week but what discussion have she have with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that the private rented sector database will contain information on epc rating so that all our resident can live in warm secure and safe home home and home standard be absolutely key to decarbonisation for variety of reason include the health benefit for resident we will consult on the warm home plan and the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for inverclyde and renfrewshire west martin mccluskey speak about the warm home discount early we be work with mhclg on bring forward the future home standard major gap in our ability to make progress in reduce emission be the disconnect both literally and figuratively between small renewable energy scheme and the community in which they be situate think in particular of the coniston hydro scheme which face resilience and sustainability issue relate to the removal of rock be the answer to this not the creation of local energy market to reduce the gap between service user and energy producer will the government back the urgent delivery of to make local energy market reality save coniston hydro scheme and service the local community in this role there be lot of acronym have to say that do not know until sit on this bench but understand from my colleague that we be look into that we support local community project and we will be look at that project and will come back to the hon member on brewery carbon emissions what step his department be take to support brewery to reduce carbon emission we want to make sure that business benefit from our clean energy mission especially those in vital industry such as brewing our forthcoming carbon budget and growth delivery plan and our refreshed industrial decarbonisation strategy will help to provide further clarity for such business include on how we intend to support they to electrify one of the many brand of woking base asahi be cornish orchards which have recently decarbonise and cut its emission by by invest in renewable energy do the minister agree that that be exactly the sort of innovation we need what further step will his department take to ensure that the brewing industry can decarbonise and use renewable electricity lot more than it do currently commend asahi which know be an important employer in the hon member constituency for its work on decarbonisation and also for be my favourite japanese beer in previous life work as fitter mate in brewery and know how difficult it be to decarbonise the process there maybe it be something should learn more about and would be very happy to come along to asahi if be invite onshore wind turbines what step he be take to support green energy company to build onshore wind turbine the government have publish an onshore wind strategy to remove barrier to help company build more onshore wind with action across several area include planning aviation workforce and route to market the uk be commit to grow our wind energy manufacturing capacity but this require investment in innovation to develop the next generation of product that could be make in the uk use expertise that exist in place like my constituency of isle of wight west can the minister assure that the government be do everything possible to provide the funding to not only create job but provide sovereign ownership of blade technology and development in the uk so that we become true energy superpower my hon friend be right to recognise the importance of the industry in his constituency vestas be key part of the uk wind supply chain the isle of wight be already successful centre for wind blade manufacturing and research and development can assure he that we be do everything we can to work with partner and right across government on the proposal and that include the agreement in principle between vestas and the government to support the factory repurpose to make onshore wind blade save job energy company of any kind whether oil and gas or renewable need certainty to plan to invest whether it be onshore or offshore the government consultation on the north sea energy future close on april almost six month ago and the industry be still await an outcome the only guidance on timing on the government website be to visit this page again soon to download the outcome to this public feedback the ongoing delay be cause huge uncertainty for sector of all type of energy investment can the minister confirm when the outcome of the consultation will be publish with date or week not vague timescale on the substance of the hon member question we launch the future of energy in the north sea consultation with detailed set of question which we be analyse at the moment we will publish the response to that as soon as possible but be sure she will understand that we want to make sure we have it absolutely right have engage with industry to tell it about the timeframe for that throughout the process let just say one thing the hon member talk about uncertainty what could be more uncertain than the leader of the opposition come to aberdeen and talk down the investment in offshore wind hydrogen and carbon capture the very thing that will retain the supply chain in the north east of scotland uncertainty be what the conservative party bring to this reduce energy bills what step he be take to reduce energy bill what step he be take to reduce energy bill what step he be take to reduce energy bill the government believe that our mission to deliver clean power by be the good way to break our dependence on global fossil fuel market and protect bill payer permanently we recognise that we need to support household struggle with bill while we transition to clean power that be why we be expand the warm home discount to around an additional million household recently visit st bartholomew church in hyde which have serve the resident of

the quantitative easing programme by the bank of england more than decade ago do the secretary of state agree with the liberal democrats that we should instead use those excess profit to fund green

speaker statement before we start the statement want to say few word about our former colleague lord campbell of pittenweem well know to we as ming who die during the conference recess ming be universally like and respect across the house regardless of people party allegiance unflappable kind principle incredibly active and hold in great esteem by all party ming achieve success as an olympian as lawyer and as formidable politician in both houses of parliament as well as leadership of the liberal democrats he be one of westminster most authoritative voice on foreign affair particularly in articulate his party opposition to the invasion of iraq in on personal level ming be loyal friend to and to my family he serve with my father on the trade and industry committee where they conduct many inquiry most notably into the iraq supergun affair the two often vent their frustration about the thwarting of their effort to get ministers official or even fellow member to appear before their committee but despite that they pursue the inquiry fearlessly in order to get to the truth some thing have never change know that ming be hit especially hard by the death of his wife elspeth they be of course marry for more than year courage wisdom and integrity be ming hallmark we have lose dear colleague and for many of we wonderful friend our thought be with ming family his friend and his ally across the political party on point of order mr speaker may first thank you for that generous tribute to our dear friend ming want to let the house into secret about ming campbell he be obsess with sport as one might expect from someone who be the captain of the scottish man team at the commonwealth game remember he talk about how he have be captivate by the london olympics at the age of seven listen to it on the radio with his mother and how he have decide back then that he want to run at future olympic game it be dream of so many young boy and girl but ming thank to his determination drive and work ethic actually make it happen he represent our country at the tokyo game in for man once know as the flying scotsman who set new british metre record at second and who be probably the fast person ever elect to this house ming be never one to brag about his sporting accomplishment in fact he be such gentleman and so averse to boastfulness that it could be hard to get he to talk about they at all remember when wayne rooney break metatarsal in his foot ahead of the world cup ming have tell we story about how he have suffer an injury before the olympic game and how hard he have work to overcome it we be all beg he to go on the radio tell that story and encourage wayne rooney rare chance for the liberal democrat leader to break into the big sport story of the day but ming would not do it have to admit that it be frustrating at the time but it be also mark of why he be so respected and admire that level of modesty be rare in anyone especially in politician but those of we who know ming know that it be simply the kind of man that he be it say lot about ming many and varied accomplishment that his extraordinary sporting achievement be britain fast man and represent his country at the olympics will not be what he be most remember for nor will he be most remember for his law career though he excel at that too he be even offer the chance to become judge on scotland high court in but he turn it down because by then as he put it politic have get into his blood and so what ming will be most remember for be his enormous contribution to british politic parliamentary career span five decade include year represent north east fife get to know ming early during his first parliament when be the party economic adviser base in our whips office even then he already have so much gravita he be so charming so thoughtful and so respected ming be among those few mp who be genuinely grandee from the first day they be elect but his calmness reasonableness and intense decency mask radical politician man who never forget his root after grow up in glasgow tenement and who be drive by deep commitment to social justice he say it be his role and the role of the liberal democrats to rattle the cage of british politic and he do especially as you say mr speaker when it come to foreign affair and defence on which he lead for our party for over year include of course in the lead up to and after the iraq war remember how difficult decision it be for we to oppose that war it feel like we be not just go against the government but take on the full might of the british state and the united states too the way ming tackle it with his typically steady forensic and lawyerly approach give we both the confidence and resolve to speak up strongly for what we believe he make our position firmly rooted in respect for international law at time when the world be in turmoil follow the horrific terrorist attack of september ming provide principle leadership with his trademark combination of morality courage and wisdom and he continue to do so whether as leader of our party as respected member of the intelligence and security committee and of the foreign affairs committee or in the other place benefit greatly from ming advice and guidance over more than year and turn to he often about foreign affair in my own time as leader will miss his wise counsel as know many of we will but more than that he be an incredibly warm and caring friend colleague with such generosity and humour he call his late wife elspeth his rock and she be always by his side mostly with cigarette they be such good fun and such great company it be once say of ming that he run the risk of give politician good name well he certainly do that his passing be moment for we to consider how we be all view as politician and what change we could make both individually and collectively to further the cause of good decent hopeful politic something that ming embody entirely ming campbell be dedicated public servant tireless champion for fife st andrews and the united kingdom and true liberal giant know all of we in the liberal democrat family and across this house will miss he terribly far to that point of order mr speaker everyone in this house know what an honour it be to represent our country but for most of we that appreciation come from the rather sedentary position on these benches not from the international running track where lord campbell of pittenweem first represent great britain at the olympic game in tokyo in he remain quick on his foot as barrister before become an mp where be tell he make the most of his talent by sprint door to door while canvass ultimately of course he become respected voice on foreign and defence affair become leader of the liberal democrats this be despite many overture from one of my predecessor his old glasgow university friend john smith to join the labour party as young man no ming as many come to know he be determine and he know his own mind ming campbell be authoritative on the subject that he be passionate about so it be no wonder that he have the respect and admiration of colleague across the house who recognise his wisdom and unfailing kindness over year of service as member of this parliament today we remember his commitment to scotland and in particular of course to fife champion its industry from fish to in his case fly as well as become chancellor of the university of st andrews where he speak of his joy at meet student and young people full of hope for the future future he have do so much to shape it be full life well live alongside elspeth his beloved wife of more than year we be all enrich by his sense of duty and commitment to this country he stand in the fine tradition of this house so it be privilege on behalf of the labour benches to pay tribute to the flying scotsman may he rest in peace call the leader of the opposition far to that point of order mr speaker on behalf of the conservative party would like to add my voice to the tribute pay today to lord campbell have the pleasure of meeting sir ming campbell as he be then just once backstage before any he be very courteous very curious and very earnest we all know how well respected he be across this house not least because of the effort he make to work cross party especially on international matter he be man with clear sense of right and wrong commit to do the right thing even when it be difficult or unpopular so very much hope that his legacy of careful thought integrity and public service endure on behalf of myself and my party extend heartfelt condolence to sir ming family his party and all those who know he and love he far to that point of order mr speaker for those of we on all side who be here during the debate on the iraq war want to thank ming for the legal advice that he provide and the way that he address that debate because he do so without seek any party advantage he simply set out the legal principle on which he be make his decision and he do so with compassion and with the recognition of the moral duty that we all have many of we agree with he and vote with he and many do not but everybody respect his judgment as result believe he be model mp always speak and vote on the basis of his conscience and the interest of his constituency and the country overall he will be greatly miss but think his lesson will remain with many of we throughout our own parliamentary career call the father of the house far to that point of order mr speaker as conservative want to join our liberal friend in pay tribute to such gallant and charming gentleman his least successful period in this house be probably as leader of his party perhaps he be just too nice perhaps he could see both side of the question but what great man and what great foreign affair spokesman follow on from the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell the whole episode of the iraq war be so difficult for we in this house particularly for those of we who break with our party to oppose it he give we leadership and rigour and he have be prove right of course there be no prize for be prove right but history will prove he right far to that point of order mr speaker stand here as friend of ming but also as the current representative of his seat know how much he feel the privilege of be elect to this house for year as the representative for north east fife also know the very high regard in which he be hold in the constituency all have have both myself and the msp for the constituency willie rennie who be previously member of this place be very kind thought from constituent and story about ming that we have take to our heart he first stand for parliament in greenock in greenock be my hometown be quite reassure when be first engage with ming that we at least have something in common what the prime minister say be right he have the opportunity to switch to other party but he choose not to although he first stand in it take until before he be elect in north east fife that show the spirit and determination he have as an individual but also the work he do to build the constituency and build the local party have have lot of thought from the local party too one of they think would be worth share with the house shortly after his election which be close contest against the sit conservative mp they decide to take celebratory boat trip out to the isle of may to see the puffin unfortunately the boat break down on the way ming and elspeth keep everybody calm it be interesting that even people who do not vote for he come out and rescue the boat laughter that be the respect with which he be regard in his tribute my constituency colleague willie rennie say that ming have have three career politic law and obviously sport he be parliamentarian he be kc he be an olympian and he be companion of honour if any of we can aspire to the great height that ming reach that be worth aspire to the prime minister also mention his chancellorship of the university of st andrews which he hold for year know that those at the university be very sad at his loss and passing indeed my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey and visit the university last week to meet they and discuss ming will finish with some personal memory he be great support to but do remember when be run for the selection in that there be constituency lunch in north east fife one of the member who be supportive of my candidacy make sure that be sit at the same table as elspeth because be assure that if could get elspeth onside ming would surely follow since be elect we would meet every so often every month we would have cup of tea and scone in the pugin room and he would tell all the thing that need to be do the secretary of state for defence be not here but ming would always ask right up until the last time see he about leuchars and what the strategic defence review mean and talk about how important defence be for he and the constituency there be no doubt that the loss of elspeth be devastating and he be never quite the same think everybody would accept that when we see he here but really up until those last week he although very frail be absolutely still there and we have many great conversation see he just the week before he die and it do feel like goodbye conversation know that he will be much miss across this house and be very grateful for all the tribute that have be pay to he hear hear far to that point of order mr speaker ming campbell be good friend of mine there be body call the nato parliamentary assembly which have not be mention yet today ming campbell be member for over year only really pause when he become leader of the liberal democrats when join that body in the respect with which ming campbell be regard across the entire alliance indeed by so many partner country almost across the world become apparent almost immediately it do not matter if we be meet president prime ministers or even royal family ming would come into the room and greet say the king of spain in the same way he would greet somebody in the tea room and the respect shine through remember very clearly when he be the chairman of several of the assembly committee sometimes ally in those committee maybe do not quite see eye to eye and get into some really heated argument ming simply hit the table and say enough and the silence fall that be the level of respect he have during the coalition year he be able to be appoint as leader of the united kingdom delegation to the assembly when have the honour of take on that role do not think many week pass when do not call ming on his mobile phone and say ming need some advice on this difficult situation that be especially true during the covid year when we be try to work out how we be go to make the annual and spring assemblies work online ming be always there with sage advice on how to lead our delegation one thing that be true about serve on an international body be that we spend an awful lot of time in airport especially when flight be delay ming always have story and they be genuinely fascinating his legal career have be mention there be one particular story that like because it show his quick wit and his ability to move swiftly on his foot which be an important ability for kc he say he have be prosecute defendant charge with cause affray and drunken disorderly behaviour he put the question how much have you drunk apparently the defendant say oh only eight or nine pint he pause and say be you mean to tell this court that you drink gallon of beer and you do consider that to be very much he say that at that point he know he have he he would tell so many story he be very proud of his time in san francisco where he train to be top sprinter he say academically it do go quite as well as it should have do think just spend far too much time at the track he be as have say enormously respect across the world he be great friend to and great sage his politic be clear but his party allegiance do not matter when it come to important role of state and the intellectual rigour that have to be bring to important issue will miss he and know great number of people in this house will miss he he truly be giant of british politic far to that point of order mr speaker have the distinction of succeed ming campbell in this place he probably be not unhappy that be not his current successor he speak so highly of his current successor but have to say how highly think of he have hear so many nice story today about his role globally but as the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain reflect so beautifully more important than that be that he be so highly regard locally when take over from he it be difficult to go to any one of the community in his constituency where there be not story or somebody who have be help and at the university of st andrews he be an outstanding chancellor and colleague want to pay tribute to somebody who may not have agree with but when we have that precious relationship between constituency and the member of parliament nobody well replicate that in his day to day work want to pay tribute to european and an internationalist but more than that an outstanding local representative far to that point of order mr speaker wish to add my word of tribute to my friend ming campbell he have an impact on long before meet he the first general election be active in be no offence to any other liberal mp at the time none of they be present here but be very impressed with ming campbell he strike as not be like other liberal mps he look like he could actually run the country laughter he have gravita be pretty sure that be what say to my mother in the early hour of think june when he gain north east fife from the conservatives you look the real deal you look incredibly competent and of course in the year that follow he demonstrate that we have talk about the iraq war what ming campbell do yes apply his legal expertise and insight into international law as well as the law of this land be to make the connection in what be often think of as the esoteric business of human right that human right be about human duty they be about make sure that nobody be above the law no prime minister and no president he make that clear and make it crossover into public consciousness in way that be really very remarkable then realise have connection with ming when meet my wife rosie in the it turn out that she now sadly late father mark cantley open the bowling with ming at glasgow hillhead they have not speak to each other for odd year until ming come to do talk at the university at ambleside shortly after have be select and the two of they continue friendship until mark pass just two year ago in the year be elect the late great charles kennedy be mean to be do the constituency visit to westmorland but his son be bear the night before ming get draft in at the last minute and do two visit for when you win by vote every single thing count so have he to thank for that when ming become leader in have the honour of serve as his parliamentary private secretary what insight do get during that time he be obsess with sport and run and despite the fact that this be man who could run metre in second he be incredibly generous in hear the story of somebody who be rate fall runner in my time as leader ming be great source of advice and wisdom after that time he and his wife elspeth who we have mention would regularly go on holiday in ullswater and they would always make point of do visit in westmorland whether we ask they or not laughter my recollection be of ming talk to the local newspaper or tv station and elspeth with not simply fag but pink cigarette holder look every bit real life lady penelope from the thunderbirds one of our predecessor the late great jo grimond once say that the good liberal candidate should dress to the right and talk to the left ming campbell bear all the air of an establishment figure and be radical to his die breath he be kind wise decent talented and loyal he be my friend and miss he far to that point of order mr speaker would like to state that sir ming campbell as he then be be the perfect example of how it be possible to disagree with another parliamentarian on key issue and yet work side by side on other issue without any rancour or reservation my dealing with ming do not get off to the good start as we be generally on opposite side of debate about the replacement of trident submarine and the replacement of continuous at sea deterrence by part time patrol nevertheless once we get to know each other well on the intelligence and security committee we find ourselves make common cause on such issue as the safeguarding of the vital bbc monitoring service for the future the need to enhance spending on defence with an improved defence budgeting priority and above all the folly that could have happen of britain intervene militarily in the syrian civil war in short ming bring courtesy style courage and grace to public life to the benefit of society as whole far to that point of order mr speaker would also like to pay tribute to ming campbell whom meet personally in later year but whose political influence have hang over my entire adult life as an year old student at the university of glasgow hear about these three great figure of british politic who have study together and be great friend donald dewar who become the first first minister of scotland john smith whose legacy as leader of the labour party be well respected and of course ming campbell find that his persona his influence his attitude to politic and his integrity influence it be one of the thing that pull towards the liberal party as it then be the first time come across ming personally be year later about year after he have step down as leader when make my maiden speech to the scottish conference discover that be speak on motion propose by ming campbell which be of course this will come as no surprise to many about raf leuchars its future and what we need to do to defend it that be thread that run through in when be stand in edinburgh west ming come to launch my campaign in fact he help up on to chair so that everybody could see he be there to be supportive learn lot about his kindness and thoughtfulness few week later when my husband die and ming take the time to take aside and make sure be okay and that have the support need to get through the campaign most of all though enjoy my chat with ming on monday in the departure lounge at edinburgh airport he always have tale to tell and he always have kind word about my column in the scotsman my team in the office be endlessly amuse by how pleased be that ming campbell have even read my column never mind agree with it ming be in many way with the integrity kindness and thoughtfulness that everyone have speak about an example that we should all aspire to and try to live up to there be certain restaurant in pimlico which be sure my colleague be aware of that many of we be introduce to by ming campbell be sure we think of he every time we go there as think we will the next time we go we may make point of go there and raise glass to someone who be an example not just of what we should be but perhaps of what the world need now more than ever among its politician far to that point of order mr speaker think it be appropriate that on behalf of the democratic unionist party and indeed on behalf of all northern ireland parliamentarian extend our condolence to the liberal democrats and to the colleague who know mr campbell well than do first come across sir ming when be at school and he become leader of his party when be at university it be not his prowess his intelligence or his ability to launch an argument that strike but his name ming know of no other mings than ming the merciless yet we get to know ming the merciful we get to know ming the politician who stand and achieve the respect of colleague right across this house he be sincere unionist an avow scot and true parliamentarian would like to take this moment to pass on our respect for his life and pay tribute to his legacy far to that point of order mr speaker be sure that ming would have be delighted with the tribute pay to he today by the prime minister my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey and many other just as importantly think elspeth would

update the house on the peace process in the middle east and my trade visit to india want to put on record my utter condemnation of the vile antisemitic terrorist attack at the heaton park synagogue in manchester which kill two jewish man adrian daulby and melvin cravitz antisemitism be not new hatred here in britain jews have have to deal with the shameful reality that their building their way of life and their child need extra protection we must also be crystal clear that while this be an attack on jews because they be jews the islamist extremism that motivate this sick individual be threat to every citizen of this country it be an attack on british value british security and the british decency that hold our community together moreover we can see clearly that antisemitism be on the rise in britain once again we will scale up the protection we provide for jewish people we will set out new measure to prevent hatred abuse the democratic right to protest we will stop at nothing to root out antisemitism the same apply to the arson attack on the peacehaven mosque an attack on british muslims be also an attack on we all so we condemn this despicable crime and the poison of anti muslim hatred we will fight against hate in all its form now turn to the middle east and to word have long to say in this house for very long time the survive hostage be free the bombardment of gaza have stop and desperately need aid be start to enter as result of the peace plan lead by president trump we have the chance it be chance to bring terrible chapter in history finally to close it be moment of profound relief for the house this nation and indeed the whole world but it be temper of course by the knowledge that for the hostage and their family the love one of those kill on october and the innocent civilian in gaza the dead the bereaved the starving this have be two year of live hell think of avinatan or who have family tie to the united kingdom return at last to his family and his girlfriend noa avinatan and noa be take from that music festival two year ago the footage of their abduction film by hamas evil commit to camera have meet avinatan family and hear for myself the agony that they suffer for two long year wait for he to come home his frail condition be shocking evidence of the appalling treatment he must have endure we await the release of the deceased hostage their family need the chance to grieve so we demand that they be return to their family immediately my thought be also with the people of gaza almost all of whom will have lose family member husband wife brother sister and bad of all son and daughter over child be kill think of people like yara yaghi who meet year ago she be year old and be study at college in hertfordshire she have lose member of her family pain that can not be erase even as we welcome the peace today mercifully the killing and destruction have now stop and aid be begin to enter gaza to be clear we urgently need to see more aid and fast all restriction must now be lift the need for food sanitation healthcare and shelter be all still acute while the signing yesterday be historic what matter now be implementation and get help in as quickly as possible the uk be provide million in additional humanitarian support to get water sanitation and hygiene product to ten of thousand of civilian across gaza that be in addition to the support we be already provide our two field hospital in gaza have already see patient and early this month we evacuate the third group of sick and injure palestinian child to the united kingdom they be now be treat by the nhs we will work with the un and our partner to go far and fast in provide the aid that be so desperately need let no one be in any doubt that none of this would have be possible without president trump this be his peace deal deliver of course with president sisi of egypt the emir of qatar and president erdoğan of türkiye alongside our partner we offer the uk full support to these effort we have work behind the scene for month with the us and arab and european nation to help deliver ceasefire get the hostage out get aid in and secure well future for israel gaza and the west bank be proud of our contribution we be in position to play this role precisely because of the approach this government take that include our decision to recognise the state of palestine this move take alongside our ally france canada australia and other help lead to the historic new york declaration in which for the first time the entire arab league condemn the atrocity of october urge hamas to disarm and crucially demand that it end its rule in gaza but let be clear that while we celebrate the relief of peace today make that peace last will be no less difficult task along with our ally we will have absolute focus in the day and week ahead on the relentless implementation of the peace plan that be no small challenge so we stand ready to deploy our diplomacy and expertise in three key area the first be in support the reconstruction of gaza which be an immense task the devastation defy description this will require truly international effort we be ready to play our part start at conference this week here in the united kingdom host by the minister for the middle east my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer secondly to support transitional governance arrangement in gaza we will continue to work closely with the palestinian authority on the vital reform that they need to make thirdly we will help ensure security in gaza through ceasefire monitor process and planning for the international stabilisation force draw on our experience in northern ireland we stand ready to play full role in the decommissioning of hamas weapon and capability because as the house know there can be no viable future for gaza and no security for israel if hamas can still threaten bloodshed and terror so we will work to put that threat out of action for good this be the first real chance we have have of two state solution since the oslo accord over three decade ago so we be fully commit to this because safe and secure israel alongside viable palestinian state be the only way to secure last peace for the middle east have be clear all along that that must be our goal so we will work now to follow through on the point peace plan and deliver it in full include by support dialogue to agree on political horizon for peaceful co existence finally want to update the house on my discussion with prime minister modi last week in mumbai india be grow force on the world stage and be on track to have the third large economy by in addition to the bond that we already share the live bridge of family and history we be also unite by the future and the incredible opportunity that we see before we that be why back in july we sign historic trade deal open up new opportunity for british business in india that be why last week lead the big british trade delegation to india ever we announce that more british university be open campus in india make we its lead international education provider we be also deepen the uk india technology security initiative to boost opportunity for our brilliant tech sector we also announce new deal and investment include in advanced manufacturing defence car production and bollywood film make here in the united kingdom those investment into the united kingdom be worth billion and they will create job that be real change that people will see in their community up and down the country set that out because it speak again to our approach on the world stage as do our deal with the united states and the eu and the approach that we bring to crisis and conflict as well instead of threaten to walk away or indulge in the cheap political theatre that come from castigate our ally ally we need to deliver peace and economic stability in dangerous volatile world we stay in the room we trust in diplomacy and we back the reputation talent and pride of this country to change the world to the benefit of the british people this be politic of national renewal in which we work with our partner rather than against they politic that solve problem rather than exploit they and that believe that our openness to the world be what help we take control of our future rather than shut the door and hop for the good that be how the government deliver for britain commend this statement to the house call the leader of the opposition be grateful to the prime minister for advance sight of his statement remember almost two year ago meet three mother whose child have be steal from they on october and hold captive in terror tunnel they be live nightmare unimaginable for any parent many of we on the conservative benches have meet hostage and their family and hear their story and support they yesterday it be truly momentous to finally see the return of the live hostage who be now back home in israel after over day in terrorist captivity the hostage release yesterday show superhuman endurance in the face of evil we send every good wish to they and their family as they begin the process of rebuild their life we also mourn those hostage kill by hamas and continue to call for all their body to be return to their family we must never forget what happen on october the abduction of man woman and child be calculated cruelty to break body mind and soul after inflict the mindless horror of rape and murder there be no cause and no grievance that can ever justify what happen that day for one will never forget the response from some in the west the equivocation the indulgence in whataboutery and the drawing of false equivalence show how far moral clarity have erode we have job to do here at home to fix that on the conservative benches we stand alongside israel in our share fight against islamist terror the conflict could have end long time ago if the hostage have be return so many palestinian life have be needlessly lose because of this war hamas be genocidal terrorist organisation sustainable end to the suffering of civilian in gaza mean the complete eradication of hamas and the dismantling of their terrorist infrastructure even now we know that hamas be still kill palestinians in gaza the initial phase of the us back peace plan represent significant breakthrough thank the us administration president trump and regional mediator for have secure this outcome they put in the hard yard and find solution make clear that all progress would depend on the release of the hostage condition that some other government forget with this peace deal there be much to be hopeful for in the middle east if the abraham accord be expand new age of peace will have arrive we will see diplomatic normalisation of relation between israel and the arab world something that many of we have long to see it sadden that the prime minister statement do not appear to show that the uk be at the heart of any of these effort specifically it be quite clear that uk relation with israel have be strain by the government action israel view it have be state publicly be that it look like the prime minister under pressure from his back benchers have take the wrong decision time and again diminish our influence in the region hon member shame labour members can shout shame as much as they want within week of labour come into power the government decide to restore funding to the united nations relief and works agency we have not forget that interruption they say yes that be an organisation whose member assist in the kidnapping of the hostage whose release we be celebrate today relation with israel have be so damaged that when israel launch strike against iran country that have be direct threat to we for year the uk be out of the loop labour members may not like it but that be the truth then in move praise by hamas labour decide to recognise state of palestine without impose the condition that hostage still hold in the tunnel of gaza be release reward terrorism interruption they may chunter from sedentary position remind they that the british israeli former hostage emily damari call that moral failure be surprised to hear the prime minister say that recognition contribute to the peace deal we all know that the us secretary of state marco rubio condemn that recognition say that it have make ceasefire negotiation hard that be what the us say the truth be that as historic event have unfold in the middle east britain have be out of step with the us the us ambassador to israel even call the government claim that they have play key role in the ceasefire delusional which israeli foreign ministers agree with welcome the prime minister promise to scale up protection for jewish people in our country britain have always be sanctuary for british jews but after the tragic murder of two british jews outside synagogue in manchester the government must now do everything they can do eradicate antisemitism the anti israel protester who have turn our street into theatre of hate have be relatively silent about the good news of ceasefire and hostage return show we their real motivation the prime minister mention in his statement the palestinian authority will he tell we whether the government preference be for the palestinian authority to take the rein in gaza if they have commit to end the pay for slay policy that reward family of terrorist for kill israelis will they deal with antisemitism in education and be they demonstrate any democratic progress there be also domestic implication we need to strengthen our border hamas be still run gaza and those allow to leave can do so only with hamas approval we should not bring anyone to britain with link to extremism to antisemitism or to hamas and other terrorist will the prime minister therefore confirm whether he intend to bring people from gaza to study for healthcare or for other purpose what measure be in place to ensure that we do not import extremism antisemitism or anyone link to hamas and other terrorist britain be great country and still powerful one we still have agency to shape the world around we the government must do well and show that they have the backbone to use britain power to make well world may thank the leader of the opposition for her word about the hostage moment ago know how heartfelt they be be surprised and sadden that she spend more time attack what we actually do to help the process than even mention the humanitarian crisis in gaza without set out in term the number of people who have be kill who be starve and who have be subject to denial of aid when the immediate task for any serious government be to work with ally to get that aid in at speed would have expect at least an acknowledgment of that terrible situation it show yet again just how far her party have slide from serious statesperson approach to diplomacy this be not the time for fight about what role any individual play be proud of what steve witkoff say about our national security adviser he be negotiate this he know the role that we play and this house should be proud of that we be able to play that role only because of the relationship that this government have with the trump administration we be trusted partner work both before this peace deal and afterwards and yes do discuss recognition of palestine with president trump when he be over here because that be what grown up responsible partner do unlike the discussion here stand by my word that in new york that be the first time that other country in the region be clear in their condemnation of hamas that be key aspect of what have now happen on her other question the leader of the opposition will know from the reform that have already be commit to that the palestinian authority will not tolerate any election of individual or party that be not commit to peaceful process that be an absolute red line it be part of the agreement and it be what we have be talk to other ally about for very long time on healthcare case as report we have have such case come to the united kingdom as well as student we be extremely careful in the check that we carry out on everybody who come to this country return to the fact that this be historic deal it be important for the region and it be important for the world it be to be celebrate across this house because of the relief it bring to the hostage and their family in particular and to the many thousand of people in gaza as say be surprised and sadden that the leader of the opposition have overlook really important part of the resolution of the conflict call the chair of the international development committee thank the prime minister his ministers and all the official who know have be work incredibly hard behind the scene for the past two year to get to this historic point he be right it be chance for peace be nervous about the next stage but it be definitely chance to get aid flooding into gaza will he give we some more detail about how that will happen in practice with israel control all the border will he also speak about the role of unrwa say to the leader of the opposition that unrwa be un organisation that act as the local authority provide education medical service sewerage and desalination it be an organisation that be central to support the palestinians face starvation and deal with the consequence of genocide urge the prime minister to continue to rally the international community to put pressure on israel to let that aid flood in and to ensure that the palestinians be central in the future of their community thank my hon friend for her hard work over many year on this issue and for raise the question of aid the critical test of the next few day and week will be whether that aid get in of course there be the goal of two state outcome but the immediate task over the next day and week be to get that aid in it be begin to go in but not in sufficient quantity and not at sufficient speed spend lot of yesterday along with our team that be work with other particularly the king of jordan on what practical assistance the united kingdom can give to ensure that aid get in as quickly as be need it be probably one of the most central issue in the come day and week and thank she for raise it thank the prime minister for advance sight of his statement join he in condemn the evil antisemitic terrorist attack that kill adrian daulby and melvin cravitz at their synagogue in manchester antisemitism must be stamp out and british jews must be able to feel safe in our country after the horrific hamas terror attack of october and two year of appal death and destruction since the ceasefire in gaza come as an enormous relief to we all it finally offer moment of hope but it be only the beginning and there be lot of work to do already today we can see how precarious the situation be with israeli force kill palestinians who they say cross the yellow line and both side accuse each other of violate the ceasefire the immediate priority must be to ensure that the ceasefire hold as well as ensure that lifesave food water and medicine reach all those face starvation and disease will the prime minister set out in more detail what the uk be do to get aid into gaza as quickly as possible and will he keep the house update on those vital effort it be so move to see the image yesterday of family weep with joy as hostage be reunite with their love one however do the prime minister share my anger and the anger of bereaved family that hamas have still not release the body of all deceased hostage those terrorist capture innocent people hold they hostage and kill they and even now they deny their family the chance to bury they and mourn they properly palestinian family be start to return home too but for many their home be now rubble and the process of rebuilding will be long and difficult ceasefire be not the same as last peace only two state solution can deliver that so welcome the prime minister decision to finally recognise palestine last month what work be he do with partner to help build viable palestinian state that can live peacefully alongside israel have he speak to president trump and prime minister netanyahu to make it clear that the expansion of illegal israeli settlement in the west bank must stop israelis and palestinians have suffer unimaginable trauma and much of it will never be heal but today they can at least begin to hope that their child will grow up free of this appalling cycle of violence thank the right hon gentleman for the content and tone of his response on his question we be work with other on get aid into gaza until recently that have be mainly airdrop but what we really need be truck go in that be what we focus on in the practical work we be do yesterday in egypt and we will continue to do so will take up the right hon gentleman invitation to update the house on that personally think that in these early day it be probably one of the single most important thing that we need to absolutely focus on yes it be an historic day but implement the plan be really important any misstep any step backwards would have the potential to undermine what happen yesterday absolutely agree that the body must be release those poor family need to be able to grieve properly and they can not do so it be cruel that the body have be hold for so long and they must be immediately release the two state solution be necessarily and rightly the long term objective do not believe there will be last peace without two state solution safe and secure israel which we do not have and viable palestinian state which we do not have so that must be the end goal and we be work with other to ensure that remain the goal along the way there have to be the work on the governance security and reconstruction in gaza have to say that once the medium be fully into gaza think we will be have quite some debate in this house when the full horror of what have happen there and the devastation be finally see on illegal settlement yes absolutely have make it clear in relation to the west bank what must happen or not happen should say in relation to the illegal settlement it be important that we ensure that this process lead to last peace for israel for gaza and of course for the west bank as well the prime minister mention his conversation with president sisi so may take this opportunity to thank he for his conversation and intervention with president sisi and his team to secure the release of alaa abd el fattah from an egyptian prison we be all elated at the release of the hostage and the detainee and prisoner but there be some confusion about whether two prominent gazan palestinian doctor have be release dr hussam abu safiya and dr marwan al hams be both detain and unfortunately ill treat in israeli prison it would be really helpful if the prime minister could confirm whether they have be release and if they have not be make further representation to the israeli authority thank my right hon friend for his word in relation to alaa abd el fattah and for his long campaign to raise that important issue on the two doctor what can say be that the case have be raise do not yet know what the status be but will do my good to find out and get well answer to he as quickly as we can call the father of the house beneath all the peace rhetoric the brutal hamas regime be openly execute people yesterday and refuse to give up their weapon prime minister netanyahu have say that he be go to remove they by force if necessary and he refuse to accept state in the west bank it may be naive but can not both side of the house unite in say that we be absolutely completely committed to create palestinian state in the west bank that be their god give right and it be the only way we be go to end the cycle of despair and violence that sound like the old tory party use to know and be really pleased to hear it in sense it be only by unite across this house in the face of conflict that have go on for far too long and by be clear eyed about the only way there can be peace that be last that we will be able to play full part as country in bring that about welcome the old tone and the old content that just hear the emotional scene in recent day in palestine and israel be proof that only politic and never violence can bring security to the people of the region accountability for the heinous killing that have take place must be part of the future too as someone who as an aid worker stand in hospital in gaza last year know that the uk can play key role in rebuild gaza decimate health system will the prime minister meet to discuss this and will he convey the thank of those on the government benches to the national security adviser who have play truly vital role in make the ceasefire happen not for the first time the leader of the opposition have no idea what she be talk about and her back benchers know it as well do acknowledge the important role that the national security adviser play it be typical uk role quiet behind the scene and diplomatic but bring about really helpful step towards the desire end will make sure that my hon friend get meeting with the relevant minister on the other issue be not yesterday an historic and much long for day for which this government and the last one work tirelessly since the dreadful event of october do the prime minister agree that just as real progress at oslo be make on the back of the intifada so now we must use the exceptional connection and deep historical knowledge that britain have throughout the region to help secure definitive resolution for the middle east to problem that have disfigure the world and poison the well of international progress and opinion for so many generation first acknowledge the role that the right hon gentleman play in office just before the election what he personally bring to the table in relation to this issue and the cross party way in which he work to ensure that the house as whole could bring to bear pressure to bring about change he be right about the goal that we need to achieve and the way we want to achieve it so wholeheartedly agree with he can say to the leader of the opposition that not every statement in this house be an opportunity for political knockabout this be one of those occasion that require statesperson there be report that militia group be seek to gain control of certain area in gaza what can be do to make sure that it be the people of palestine who determine their future and not the big gang what can we do about this situation thank my hon friend for raise that issue there be concern report of what gang be get up to the immediate next step need to be on the one hand get aid into gaza and on the other get well security arrangement in gaza that have to come in two stage the stabilisation force will take some time but immediate step be need to stabilise the situation now begin by express relief at the release of the hostage but anger that so many have not live to see this day and relief that palestinians be not shelter from the sky today but anger that so many be do so without friend and family by their side and without home to return to as we all embrace that collective relief let we not forget that access to aid be essential access for the world medium and investigator to document crime against humanity be essential two state solution be essential accountability be essential with those word in mind say to the prime minister what say to his predecessor two year ago history will judge we by our response and by our action up until now on too many occasion we have fail let we not do so any more agree with the right hon gentleman that aid be the immediate issue and agree that the medium absolutely need to be allow in to document what have to be see on two state solution of course there have to be accountability thank the prime minister for his statement and warmly welcome the ceasefire both for the beginning of the end of the suffering of the child of gaza and for the release of the hostage one of whom be nimrod cohen whose brother meet in jerusalem early this year and whose family be eternally grateful for everything that this country and the united states have do to secure their release also thank the prime minister for his emphasis today on the need to flood gaza with aid something we have not see do at all adequately until now do he agree with the un tom fletcher that more government need to urgently fund the un flash appeal for the occupied palestinian territories thank my hon friend for his question agree that flood aid be the essential next step and take the opportunity to have discussion with tom fletcher yesterday about what more we could do in that regard set aside the fact that we find ourselves in situation where condition have be place upon the cessation of the annihilation of an entire people and the strange delineation between hostage on one side and prisoner hold in administrative detention on the other we should all of course as the prime minister say express profound relief at the end of the killing not least of one child every minute for two year be not the lesson of the last two year that when the uk finally move on from empty rhetoric to take concrete action there be movement in the party to conflict like this and that therefore we should be think about what more concrete action we can take in particular in three area first can we please have concrete step to deter israeli territorial ambition in the west bank include ban on settlement good now that we have officially recognise that territory secondly could we have reassertion of uk support for international law and the institution that support it in particular could the prime minister use his relationship with president trump to have the sanction on individual at the un and the international criminal court lift finally if we be to support or participate in an international stabilisation force could we insist that it also cover area and of the occupy palestinian territories where the israel defence forces too often act as cover for incident of israeli terrorism thank the right hon gentleman for his question and will take each of the three part in turn certainly on the west bank we have take action as he know and we will continue to look at what further action we can take where we can with other country it be important as we focus on gaza that we do not forget the situation in the west bank as he rightly know on international law yes of course we be commit to international law and proud to uphold it and be pleased to hear he say so that be once the proud position of his party as well sadly that be no long the case on the stabilisation force the term of reference be still be draw up there be united nations security council resolution on the establishment of the force or hope there will be but the wide term of reference be not yet agree will bear in mind what he have say thank the prime minister for his statement and add my congratulation to he the national security adviser and all his ministers on the month and month of work that they have do that have contribute to this it be so generously acknowledge by the us envoy to the middle east if not by the leader of the opposition do my right hon and learn friend agree that as work towards just peace continue apace the principle of gazans for gaza whether that be in the governance arrangement or in reconstruction must apply acknowledge my hon friend championing work on this issue and agree with she that we must now all work towards viable palestinian state alongside safe and secure israel as the only way in which we will have last peace want to feel happy this week but find it impossible because with so much destruction so much devastation and so many life lose look back over the last two year and ask the question what on earth be it all for but history teach we that from the depth of such despair can often launch positive future there be only one way to achieve the everlasting peace that president trump so rightly talk about that be two state solution israelis and palestinians live side by side in dignity and security would like to thank this government for recognise the state of palestine that be promise make to my great grandfather finally make good but it be an empty promise unless it be follow by statehood so my question to the prime minister be simply will he make the palestinian state reality and will he give it his personal attention over the course of his premiership so that this be the last time we see this devastation we do not want to see repeat of that cycle of violence that we have always see in the past first acknowledge the impact that this have have on the hon member her family and her extended family that be evidence of the despair that she rightly describe and we must from the depth of that despair build well future do believe that that will be last only if we have two state outcome we have see too often in the past what appear to be step forward and what be rightly see as point of relief only for thing to fall back give my personal commitment that we will work tirelessly to ensure that this time we build on the signing of the agreement yesterday through all the work that be go to have to be do along the way until we get to that final last solution which will have to be two state solution thank the prime minister for update the house on the three point join he in his condemnation of the antisemitic terrorist attack in manchester and the arson attack on the peacehaven mosque and welcome his commitment to fight hatred in all its form and the support provide for security at synagogue and mosque ask the prime minister to ensure that security at all our place of worship remain priority on the approach take by the prime minister on the middle east and the ongoing engagement with india pragmatic engagement have be show to be the correct approach do he agree that the british value of democracy respect internationalism and perseverance be go to be key to the ongoing work require to deliver two state solution but also far economic progress and trade deal that will benefit the people of the uk agree with my hon friend we must provide the security need at all our place of worship know that across the house people will be sadden and concern to know that some of our place of worship require the sort of security that we be see today that be something we must all work to alleviate that be partly question of put in more resource but it be much big than that in term of the change that we need to bring about do believe that the approach that we be take of diplomacy stick to our value and be in the room to argue be of benefit to this country in relation not only to the middle east but to india and the wide world after the horror of manchester there be sense of joy and relief in synagogue in my constituency at the final release of the hostage many of whom be sponsor by synagogue but there be also sense of trepidation when they see hamas terrorist patrol the street of gaza and carry out summary execution so welcome the prime minister commitment that hamas can have no role in gaza while he be on the issue of islamic extremism do he agree that now be the time to review the uk government approach to the muslim brotherhood which have be ban in many other country such as the united arab emirates join the right hon gentleman in note the feeling of trepidation because think that across the country we can all feel the trepidation and fear follow the terrible impact that the manchester attack have on all our community but the jewish community in particular absolutely assert and be clear that hamas must play no role whatsoever that be why it be so important that we work with our international ally on the follow through from what happen yesterday aid security and make sure that the step be in place to move on at speed and that be the big risk frankly to this agreement that we be not able to move sufficiently quickly on those important issue we do keep the muslim brotherhood question under constant review welcome this long overdue ceasefire and phase one of this peace plan the devastating number of palestinians kill include more than child be intolerable and countless other have life change injury the devastation we have witness happen as result of previous bombardment happen without any accountability those atrocity be awful what action will be take to ensure that this time justice and accountability for the destruction of gazan civilian infrastructure for the man make famine and for the mass killing of civilian be make reality the immediate focus be obviously on follow through on the agreement with the practical next step do think that be of first importance reiterate again our commitment to international law and to accountability include of course accountability for what happen on october which be the bad single attack on jews since the holocaust we all welcome the release of the hostage the ceasefire and the beginning of the end of the suffering in gaza know the joy that the hostage family meet couple of week ago in israel will be feel they will be ecstatic as we hope that the division start to reduce in the middle east we must also hope that we can reduce the heat and division of this debate here in the united kingdom the prime minister have quite rightly refer to the rise of antisemitism do he join in hop that now be the time to bring to an end the protest we have see on our street with antisemitic chant such as from the river to the sea as we try to unify to bring people together and to move forwards agree that we need to take this moment to work to bring all our community together be genuinely sadden to see some of the protest take place in whitehall on the very day of the manchester attack and then again at the weekend notwithstanding the quite reasonable request please exercise your right of freedom of expression on different day in different way genuinely think that human decency would prevail there agree with the hon member that now be the time internationally to work on the agreement and in the united kingdom to do everything we can across this house to bring our community together welcome the prime minister statement which we all hope will bring an end to two year of awful bloodshed visit israel and palestine one month before october and meet civil society organisation work on cross community basis it strike how vital they will be in build potential future long term peace but they lack funding and they lack legitimacy and support in israel and in palestine what thought and consideration have the prime minister give to the uk role in an international peace fund similar to the northern ireland peace fund which could fund civil society organisation work cross community to support leader of the future to build peacemaker and to start to heal the rift thank my hon friend for touch on this point one of the great tragedy of what happen on october be that that cross community work particularly involve the next generation in israel and palestine try to ensure that they would have well future and could take thing forward fall away as do some of the interfaith work in this country which we all think be strong and more robust than it turn out to be we must do all we can to restore that work and build on it because it be essential as we go forward we all welcome the peace in the middle east and do not think there be member here who do not welcome two state solution but there be concern across this house about hamas lead one of those state when their fundamental goal be to drive the other state into the sea and have total eradication of that race that hatred have be translate to the street of london and the uk it be affect our british jews every single day and they be afraid what will the prime minister do to alleviate the level of antisemitism that be transfer to the street of london and manchester and across the uk because of war that have happen in the middle east can we rise above this and will the prime minister rise above this and find way forward for british jews here in the uk absolutely agree with the hon member there can be no way that hamas can play any role in palestinian state that be the absolute red line of all those that recognise palestine early this year and the red line of the new york declaration it be really important and fundamental red line that have to be keep to for all the reason that she have set out and that think everybody across this house understand on the security and safety of jews in this country of course we must step up that need to be do in number of way include through practical support and financial support sad though it be to say that we need to put even more security around our synagogue and school so that child can go safely to school in this country we must do it the government have already be work on that for some considerable time take the time on the day after the manchester attack to talk to the community security trust and other leader about what more we can do in that regard be more than happy to work across the house on this we owe it to our jewish community that we be see to be work together on these important measure and thank the hon member for her support may first associate myself with the comment of the prime minister regard the heinous attack in manchester and on peacehaven mosque an attack on any place of worship be an attack on our democracy and way of life thank the prime minister his team in particular his ministers and our national security adviser for all their effort and for the recognition of palestine as be state early it be long overdue and historically put right what we should have do long time ago that have no doubt contribute to where we be today so once again want to say huge thank you over of home in gaza have be erase with more than people displace include child could the prime minister outline in detail what more be be do to rebuild gaza in addition to aid and to our conversation reconstruction be really important task it will be extremely difficult give the level of devastation we be work with other on plan we be host conference later this week in relation to that issue and we will continue to do so but we need to do so at pace work with our ally we have huge task ahead of we the ceasefire the release of the live hostage and the flooding of aid into gaza be moment of hope for we all the prime minister have respond to number of question on accountability and he will know the importance of this moment for start to gather evidence about what have take place in gaza both the atrocity commit by hamas and the action of the idf and the mercenary work for the gaza humanitarian foundation under direction of the israeli cabinet can the prime minister spell out in little more detail what support the uk government be give to those agency that will gather the evidence that will allow for full accountability in future thank the hon member for championing and raise these important issue it be important that as we move on from the agreement and rebuild there be accountability that be why it be important that the medium and other be allow access as soon as possible and that those charge with hold other to account have what they need in order to do so know speak for my whole constituency when welcome this long overdue ceasefire may put on the record my thank to the prime minister and foreign office ministers for the many opportunity to put my constituent view to they as we turn to the ceasefire our thought turn to rebuilding but that be not just physical child make up of the population of gaza they be traumatise and their education and future have be profoundly disrupt give they future be the good guarantor of future peace so what can the british government do to ensure that the child of gaza have real future thank my hon friend for raise that point child in gaza have not be to school for the good part of two year that have have huge impact we be already work at pace with other to see how quickly that could be one of the first issue address in the rebuilding process because it be so essential for those child to ensure that they have well future the prime minister have say again today that there can be no place for hamas in govern the gaza strip but who can physically prevent hamas from retain their weapon and regain control as they do in when he talk about antisemitism in britain be there any other interpretation of the demand to internationalise the intifada than as call to attack jewish community around the world there be no other interpretation be pleased that the right hon member raise and give the opportunity to agree with he on that important point on his first point about decommissioning of course that will be difficult but it be vital it be difficult in northern ireland in relation to the ira but it be vital it be why we have say that we stand ready base on our experience in northern ireland to help with the decommissioning process will not pretend that it be easy but it be extremely important suspect that one reason our optimism be cautious be that many of we be acutely aware that the damage that have be do will last generation on all side of the conflict for some the damage can never be repair think yesterday of my constituent sharone lifschitz whose father oded be brutally murder by hamas he have spend his life drive ambulance across the border for gazan child because he want two state solution the prime minister speak of the evacuation be very proud to have work with project pure hope which be the first organisation to get child out of gaza and to the united kingdom for medical treatment now we have scheme but many more people continue to need assistance the sort that medical team in the united kingdom can provide will he update we on the commitment to that scheme how long it will be and how we in this house can make that oded legacy we be evacuate and have plan to continue do so be happy to update the house either myself or through other ministers on what we be do and how we be do it the dup welcome the release of the hostage and the prospect of long term peace in that area of the middle east know this will probably stick in the throat of many labour members but we must thank president trump for the role he have play in deliver this deal he recognise that weakness will never move terrorist and that only strength will do so lesson that unfortunately our government need to learn hamas be encourage by our government recognition of the palestinian state that lesson need to be apply at the next step the prime minister have rightly say that hamas can have no role in the future of gaza what step do he intend to take to ensure that hamas do not have the gun that enable they to have control that they relinquish that control and that they can never again use gaza as launch pad for their terrorist attack the right hon member will know that have thank president trump number of time be absolutely clear that but for president trump this peace agreement would not have be reach have have the opportunity to say that to he publicly as well as privately as the house know he and get along and that be good for our relationship with the us and our ability to influence event decommissioning be such serious issue it be very hard to see how there can be last peace unless hamas be rid of their weaponry and capability that be where the decommissioning work will be hugely important it be part of the point plan it now need to be turn into real action work with other the united kingdom have sadly in some sens experience of the challenge of decommissioning which we can bring to the table welcome the prime minister statement and of course the peace deal also welcome his crystal clear statement that there can be no last peace or viable palestinian state in which hamas be involve in any way similarly there can be no last peace without the reconstruction that be now desperately need the prime minister have say on couple of occasion today that the public will be surprised when they see the extent of the devastation that have take place right now tonne of rubble need to be remove before single bit of reconstruction can take place will he reject the isolationist call from some quarter and agree that this country will rightly play its full role in ensure that reconstruction take place can give my hon friend that assurance genuinely think that that be the position that most member across the house would want the government to take and that they would support it very much welcome the release of the hostage and what the prime minister say about aid however flood gaza with aid be not an end in itself this be about its distribution to those who need it most what reassurance can he give the house that gangster and criminal gang will not play any part as intermediary in the distribution of that aid thank the right hon member for raise that first let we be clear aid be not flood in today it be begin to go in today it need to flood in but it be not flood in yet we need to get it in he be absolutely right that distribution then become critical next issue that be why we be work with other on what security arrangement need to be in place as soon as possible in gaza to ensure that aid get to where it need to be volume speed and effective distribution be absolutely key we be work with other to ensure that we play our part in that in september of last year the government announce that they have suspend arm export licence for israel with around licence remain active the government have repeatedly say that they be block the sale of item for use in israel military assault in gaza but new channel report have find that israel import nearly million of uk munition in the first nine month of this year with total of item categorise as bullet go from the uk to israel in august alone will the prime minister confirm whether uk make munition be use in israel military assault in gaza and do he agree that world of justice and last peace must be one without those bullet and bomb the government position in relation to ban arm have be set out on many occasion and have not be alter warmly welcome the ceasefire and be deeply move as be sure we all be by the scene of israeli and palestinian family be reunite yesterday one palestinian prisoner who have not be release be mr marwan barghouti member of the palestinian legislative council who have be in prison since he do not have fair trial and be subject to human right abuse what representation have the government make in the past few day to secure the release of mr barghouti give his widespread popularity as unifying voice for palestinian right dignity and freedom and therefore his potential crucial role in secure meaningful and lasting peace in the region thank the hon lady for raise that individual case offer to provide she with further information on it as soon as we can deeply welcome this long await ceasefire and the release of the hostage thank the prime minister and his ministers for their tireless work and international leadership on this front include in the upcoming gaza recovery summit which be to be hold in the uk later this week be glad to hear of the prime minister commitment to reconstruction and aid note that recent report of the un commission of inquiry describe how the obstruction of aid get into gaza have lead to what it call the destruction of palestinians what be the current situation for un agency access to gaza and what can we do to ensure that aid flow freely tom fletcher be lead our work in relation to this and we have be clear throughout that aid can not get in at the scale and volume that be need without the un that be why we have always champion and say that the un should be part of that distribution it be fitting that this statement be follow by one on northern ireland the uk have world lead experience in sustain peace whether it be security intelligence or military and whether it be decommissioning police or political institution could urge the prime minister to do an audit of the generation of civil servant and dare say special adviser who have experience in this area and put they on offer to sustain this peace deal thank the right hon member for that suggestion also want to acknowledge his role in northern ireland he be rightly hold in high respect in northern ireland and across this house and continue to be because of what he do and the way in which he go about it that should be model for so many more of we in this house the idea of reach into the expertise we have across different party and different government be one that will take up so thank he for that suggestion very much welcome the prime minister statement and we all achingly welcome the long for ceasefire in gaza and the safe return of prisoner and hostage but do the prime minister share my concern that the point plan be without palestinian input will he acknowledge the need for palestinian self determination and their consent for any governance or stabilisation arrangement will he ensure the continue pursuit of war criminal and will he work to achieve an end to israel illegal occupation of all palestinian territory and the full engagement of sovereign palestinian state can just be clear on the point plan it be widely and warmly receive by so many country yesterday my hon friend will have see the representation at the summit in egypt yesterday include the palestinian authority it be really important that when we get an achievement like this we now focus on implement it rather than try to unpick it think across this house by and large there be agreement that there will not be last peace without two state solution we must therefore act to implement the point plan but we must also as the plan itself envisage work towards two state solution and not lose sight of that goal the image of ceasefire and family reunite be deeply heartening and moment of relief and celebration amid such immense suffering yet this fragile peace remain vulnerable particularly to the corrosive effect of misinformation true and lasting peace must be build on openness transparency and the free flow of information what step be the prime minister take to press israel to grant journalist access to gaza as part of broad commitment to truth accountability and just peace agree with the hon member that the situation be vulnerable and that be why we must not lose sight of what have to happen next we be press for medium access which be hugely important and need to happen as soon as possible in my view so that the extent of the devastation can be properly assess which will help with the necessary next step as an officer of the all party parliamentary group on christianity in the holy land be fortunate enough to be on delegation in jerusalem and the west bank last week and it be clear to our delegation from speak to palestinian christians that they be deliver hospital and school for palestinian community give that education and healthcare be key part of long term peace what conversation be the government have with the christian community in israel and palestine to ensure that they be part of the conversation as well we be have conversation with all particularly on the question of education and healthcare on many other issue as well but education and healthcare be absolutely fundamental we be have those discussion and will ensure that any further information my hon friend may have be feed into what we be do the hamas leadership be make it clear that their fighter many of whom will have be involve on october will not disband but will merge into the nascent army of palestinian state state which the prime minister unwisely and prematurely recognise be he comfortable with that the point plan be really clear on the step that need to be take that be what have be hammer out with the support and approval of so many country that be not easy but it be step that many thought be unachievable we now have to operate to that plan ensure as be absolutely clear from the plan and from all our statement that hamas can have absolutely no role in the governance of palestine that be clear red line we need to operate to the point plan now the widespread agreement to it be something many people think could not be achieve it have be achieve and now we must build on that associate myself with the remark of the prime minister on the awful attack in manchester and the attack in peacehaven want to highlight the issue of aid worker and the work of unrwa with many british aid organisation include oxfam and christian aid and islamic relief which be both base in my constituency the un have highlight that to date over aid worker have lose their life include british aid worker we must recognise the hard work that aid worker be do the prime minister have be very clear and we be unite in this house that hamas must not have any role in the rebuilding of gaza it have to be lead by palestinian civil society and the community who have face decade of siege occupation and military violence do the prime minister agree that any initiative that bypass the palestinians in favour of externally impose initiative will fail first and foremost thank my hon friend for raise the specific issue of the aid worker who have lose their life in this conflict very many life have be lose almost all aid worker have lose colleague friend and family member have hear some of that testimony at first hand and it be extremely powerful this must now be process that do involve palestinians in their own future of course it must that be the only way to get to the two state solution that we need like everyone else in this house be sure feel enormous relief at the fact that ceasefire have be achieve but that can be nothing compare with the relief feel by those israeli family who think they would never see their love one again and those thousand of child in gaza who be able to sleep last night without the fear of be bomb but we have be here before and for their sake we can not let the hope of today disappear in the same way that the promise of the oslo agreement do crucial to that will be confidence in the peace process the prime minister have allude to the lesson we can bring to that process from northern ireland one of they be on decommissioning can he tell we what support the us administration will offer to allow we to use that expertise and experience thank the hon member there be huge relief but she be absolutely right the relief for the hostage and their family and for civilian in gaza be huge by comparison to ours yes we have be here before and therefore we must drive through with confidence as to the specific way in which decommissioning might work we be at the early stage of that discussion with the us and other at this stage we simply say we stand ready to play our full part think and hope we will be take up on that and then we can work actively with other thank the prime minister for his statement today and also for this peace may it be long lasting over health worker have lose their life in gaza and many more have be physically and psychologically traumatise by the conflict there be not the health worker now to provide the healthcare that be urgently need at this time will he ensure that the uk play its part in provide healthcare to gaza and with the decimation of all the university in gaza can we also play part in train the healthcare worker of the future thank the hon lady for make that important point we be work with other the foreign secretary attend conference in paris last week where on the agenda among other thing be how we can support the restoration of healthcare which be vital as we do that we will update the house on the measure that we be take over the past two year as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on uk israel have host innumerable meeting where the family of hostage have come before we plead for our support and help in addition we have screen multiple film of the terror event on october that use real life footage capture from hamas terrorist as my hon friend the member for beaconsfield joy morrissey say the jewish community in this country feel unsafe and that this be not safe place to live any more the prime minister rightly allude to the grow rise in antisemitism in this country what will he do on concrete basis to eliminate that scourge in particular at our place of education include at university so that our jewish student feel safe on campus and at all our school so that young people grow up in this country be no long expose to antisemitism thank the hon gentleman for raise that point it be important that we rise to that challenge and ensure that our jewish community feel safe secure and part of who we be in this country that require concrete step in relation to security and safety measure we need to go far on education particularly but not only in our university although he do not mention it be sure the hon gentleman know that we need to ensure that we drive out any instance of antisemitism in the nhs look forward to work with member from across the house on all those initiative because we also need to ensure that our jewish community see that this house be unite in ensure that they have the safety and security that they deserve very much welcome the prime minister statement today after two year of relentless genocide commit by israel kill many ten of thousand of innocent people ceasefire be an historic and hopeful moment even though it take far too long to achieve watch release palestinians and israelis reunite with their family yesterday be deeply move but palestinians be far from free their right be still be deny they be still live under occupation and they will continue to suffer do the prime minister agree that palestinians must be able to exercise their right to self determination and that israel must face accountability for its crime against they what action will he take to make that reality agree that there will be no last peace without two state outcome and that be why we must continue to strive towards it of course there must be accountability for all those who have commit atrocity include those who be involve on october do the prime minister agree that real and lasting peace can only be achieve if there be accountability and justice overwhelming international consensus both legal and scholarly conclude that israel action in gaza be genocidal do the prime minister agree that the perpetrator of genocide must face justice what step will this government take to ensure that justice be achieve agree that accountability and justice be important in the middle east we be strong supporter of international law and the role that that need to play in relation to justice in the region welcome the prime minister statement today and welcome the ceasefire and the release of hostage as part of this historic but fragile peace deal also welcome the release of palestinian woman and child who be hold in israeli military prison without trial what step will the government take to ensure that justice and accountability be make reality for all victim of international law violation in israel and the occupied palestinian territories thank my hon friend for her question it be important that be clear that this government be commit to international law and to the accountability that that bring there be widely hold belief that the catalyst for the pure evil that happen on october be the fear among iran and its terrorist proxy that saudi arabia be close to sign the abraham accord the good news be that the abraham accord peace agreement between israel the united arab emirates bahrain and morocco have endure over the past difficult two year and be model for regional economic co operation and peaceful co existence in the region on the back of yesterday agreement what concrete step will the prime minister take to encourage and extend the abraham accord as key part of the emerge picture in the middle east with particular reference to get saudi arabia back to the table be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the wide picture the settlement across the wide middle east form an important backdrop and be part of the backbone of what have happen and what need to happen in the future we be talk to all party about the immediate step for the abraham accord and also about the wide settlement if that be possible because that will play an important part in stabilise the region which be what most decent and reasonable people want the world hold its breath over the past few day as glimmer of hope be on the horizon thank the prime minister ministers the government and british official for the progress that they have make with the united states to bring about this progress peace will be embed and sustain only if it be build with ordinary people palestinians and israelis who yearn for peace so what step be the prime minister take to ensure that that happen it be important to involve israelis and palestinians across the board from all community in the physical rebuilding as well as the rebuilding of the relationship that be in place just over two year ago which hold at least the prospect of well future for the next generation we need to rebuild that on all front congratulate the prime minister on get we to this point the labour government role in decommissioning in northern ireland be not as complete as portray in memo of january an adviser to the then prime minister tony blair say the ira will never be able to account for all their weapon or retrieve they what we should perhaps aim for be few more big symbolic act of decommissioning and then declare that the process be complete that adviser be certain jonathan powell now the national security adviser so will the prime minister give assurance that should the government be give such role they will not be as lax the work on decommissioning in northern ireland be really important and that be the basis on which we have put forward our offer to stand ready with other to work on decommissioning in the middle east associate myself with the prime minister condemnation of the horrific antisemitic terrorist attack on the heaton park synagogue and the arson attack in peacehaven the prime minister emphasise the uk commitment to humanitarian support while we all welcome the ceasefire we know that the humanitarian crisis be still very much ongoing will the prime minister confirm what extra monitoring new mechanism and assurance he be seek to ensure that party on the ground be able to get essential aid to every single person who need it within gaza we be have conversation about the practical measure that can be take on the ground with other particularly the jordanians in term of the physical arrangement that they think need to be in place to allow the aid in and for it then to be dissipate at pace we be work tirelessly on that project at the moment associate myself with comment on the warm and welcome news of the ceasefire and hope it lead to last peace what assurance have the prime minister receive from neighbouring partner particularly egypt and what specific action will he take first to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach gaza and secondly that it be only humanitarian that reach gaza and that weapon personnel and matériel that could aid terrorist do not enter gaza the hon gentleman make really good point the basis on which we be have our discussion be that it must be humanitarian aid humanitarian in the sense that it be genuinely for that purpose and that it be get to the people who most need it that come down to the nut and bolt of the practical arrangement on the ground with some of the neighbouring country and those be the discussion that we be have do not think anybody could fail to be move by yesterday scene of hostage finally be reunite with their family and of gazans be able to contemplate day and night without hunger and bombardment would love to be able to celebrate and believe as they be do and as they should be give the space to do but like many be anxious because we know that ceasefire be not the same as last peace can the prime minister assure my constituent that the uk government will continue to pursue accountability for past crime that building and rebuilding will be do with survivor not over the top of they and that there will continue to be justice for those who face aggression in the west bank every day let be clear in the rebuilding that must go on there have to be the bringing together of community and also the accountability and justice that be necessary for full rebuilding towards last settlement welcome the prime minister commitment to flood gaza with aid the un estimate that billion be need this year to address the humanitarian crisis in gaza of which just have be pledge the uk contribution to humanitarian relief this year will total only million so with the entire population of gaza in need of some form of humanitarian assistance do the prime minister believe that the uk contribution to gaza relief be adequate we have make significant contribution as we go forward we be look at public and private commitment to the reconstruction project that need to take place not just the aid but the rebuilding that be huge challenge that face we all and we will rise to that challenge with other welcome the prime minister statement and hugely welcome the ceasefire and the initial gaza peace plan include the release of hostage and prisoner the stopping of the bombardment of gaza and the aid start to trickle in however peace be fragile so can the prime minister reassure the house of this government long term commitment to work with international partner to support the rebuilding of gaza physically and politically to ensure last peace and pathway to palestinian statehood can give my hon friend that important assurance and thank she for her question this ceasefire be tremendous news and sincerely congratulate everybody who be involve in bring it about whoever they be include the british government be in israel last week and on the day that the ceasefire be announce visit the nova festival site and speak to civilian and soldier on the gaza border the israelis speak to be deeply dismay that the british government have decide to recognise the state of palestine before hamas have release their hostage let alone disarm do the prime minister understand why israel can not tolerate the idea of state on its border that pose security risk to its citizen and will he undertake not to move forward to support the establishment of palestinian state until there be more than promise there be actually the reality of security for israel the term on which we recognise palestine and those on which all the country that recently recognise palestine do so expressly acknowledge that hamas can play no part in its governance that be at the heart of the new york declaration as well and it be absolutely part of the point plan it be really important that we assert that and reassert it that have be the constant position of this government and my personal position so can give the hon member that reassurance warmly welcome the prime minister statement particularly his commitment to seek lasting long term peace in the region because israel will not be secure and the palestinian people will not be free until we break this endless cycle of violence turn to the immediate situation on the ground the gazans still face man make famine so really welcome the flooding in of aid that the prime minister talk about in his statement however could he say little more about the timescale for that and how soon we can start to see that aid get in and have an effect on the ground we need it to go in today tomorrow and in the come day we can not delay on that front that be among the most essential task that lie ahead particularly in relation to the man make famine add my support for yesterday ceasefire and the first tentative step on the journey to peace president trump have speak about board of peace and one of the name that have be float for membership of that board be our former prime minister sir tony blair could the prime minister confirm whether sir tony blair if he be to take seat on the board would do so as private citizen or as representative of his majesty government and what role can this house play in scrutinise any future appointment and the progress of that board the board be an important part of the architecture it be for other to decide what its membership will be but can give the commitment that we will report to the house on any development in that regard it be huge relief to all of we that the hostage be sleep at home with their family where they belong after two year of unimaginable horror however this plan and the recognition of palestine must only be the start of peace and accountability child be die from man make famine so can the prime minister please assure we that we will flood gaza with aid and continue to respect the judgment and decision of international court and tribunal can give my hon friend our assurance on both those issue welcome the ceasefire and the release of the hostage and take solace in the knowledge or at least in the hope that unlike other debate of this nature at the end of this one countless palestinian child will not have be kill by the idf however do the prime minister agree that the people of gaza do not need colonial viceroy tony blair anywhere near determine their future the former prime minister who have be in meeting with the trump administration be propose us administer gaza rebuild gaza as resort on top of the mass graf of man woman and child will the prime minister condemn this plan and tony blair involvement in rebuild be not go to condemn plan that welcome yesterday think it be really important step forward it be step that almost everybody in this house have welcome include the hon member what be important now be that we build on that plan it will be for other to decide the particular representation but of course there be the committee which will be really important in relation to the day to day matter in gaza and on which there must of course be proper palestinian representation these matter be still to be determine but really think it would be well if we do not try to unpick where we get to yesterday before we have even start to implement it and try to move forward that would inevitably take we backwards we know that humanitarian aid save life rebuild life and play crucial stabilise role so thank the prime minister for his emphasis on get aid into gaza it have be hearten to hear from the un agency that be now cross the border for the first time since march get in vital supply such as cook gas and medicine however some non governmental organisation include british ngos be still struggle to get the permission they need to operate so what more will the prime minister do to ensure that these immediate humanitarian relief effort become sustained scale up part of gaza recovery and that our british ngos can also play their full part thank my hon friend for raise that important point can reassure she that we be raise that issue with partner for all the reason she have set out as the prime minister and president trump get along do the prime minister think he can secure president trump support for genuine progress towards secure two state solution which be the only path to ensure peace security and dignity for both israelis and palestinians certainly agree that be the only path and we be of course talk to our ally about it include our american ally in the way that the hon member would expect as trust respected partner try to address one of the most intractable problem in recent history we will continue to do so like other welcome the ceasefire and the return of hostage to their family but that be very much temper by the loss of thousand of life over these past two year love one who will never return home elect representative humanitarian organisation and individual across the world include our constituent have give voice to the plight of the people of gaza these past two year can the prime minister tell what effort will be make to ensure that its people will be safe and free to shape the future of gaza and that their voice will be hear in the month and year to come thank my hon friend for remind we that however welcome the news it be temper by the loss over the past two year in gaza and in israel it be essential that the voice of those most affect by this be hear and be part of the rebuild that be now necessary gladly join in the tribute of appreciation to all include president trump who make the long await release of the hostage reality yesterday may press the prime minister on the disarming of hamas for the prime minister be that wholly non negotiable how be it to be deliver if it be not deliver in totality where do that leave this nation we would have recognise palestine that then would have continue presence of an armed and control hamas disarmament must be non negotiable and that be why it be write into the point plan and it be why we be now put ourselves forward to play part in the decommissioning it be only by decommission that we can ensure that the threat from hamas be remove that be why it be in the plan and it be why we want to play our full part we will do everything we can with other ally to bring that about thank the prime minister for his statement and welcome an end to the killing in gaza what guarantee be in place to ensure that humanitarian aid can now reach gaza without interruption will that aid be independent of the whim of the israeli government or any other actor on the ground we be do all we can to ensure that be the case because it be important for all the reason that she well understand that now involve the practical measure work with other country to ensure the aid can get in at speed and at volume it be

ensure that hamas terrorist murderous intent be stop hamas have be systematically murder all those who have stand up against they since the ceasefire take place there have be many example of execution within the gaza township hamas must be destroy what be be do to see hamas weapon remove and their influence eradicate entirely wholeheartedly agree with the hon member on the spirit and intent behind his question hamas be terrorist organisation that have inflict violence and destruction on far too many individual and they can play absolutely no part in the future our recognition of palestine be

much welcome the prime minister statement today and thank he his ministerial team and their adviser for all the work that have be do over many month to get we to this point where there be some hope

the prime minister statement today and recognise the leadership that he and his ministers have show on this issue so tirelessly and for such long time we know that sustain the peace be dependent on humanitarian service scale up rapidly in gaza and many ngos be struggle with israel restrictive and politicise new registration measure which be leave many in limbo and unable to work alongside un agency to scale up those service what be the prime minister do to ensure that we address and tackle that and ensure that the need of palestinians be meet as quickly as possible my hon friend raise an important issue about some of the hurdle and barrier that be put in the way of those want to deliver aid and we be work with other to scale up the volume and speed with which aid can get in thank the prime minister for his statement northern ireland troubles with permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement on the legacy of the trouble which still hang heavily over the life of so many people in northern ireland and across the united kingdom the good friday agreement that extraordinary act of political courage bring peace although its architect know that legacy would have to be deal with they be not able to do so this be therefore the unfinished business of that agreement and it be why so many too many victim and survivor be still wait for answer about what exactly happen to those whom they love so much the previous government northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act fail to win support in northern ireland fail to comply with our international human right obligation and be undeliverable whatever its intention it be no basis for try to move forward that be why the government be today introduce new primary legislation and lay draft remedial order under the human rights act as we seek to fulfil our king speech commitment to repeal and replace the legacy act this legislation will give effect to the framework that announce with the irish government on september which reflect the principle of the stormont house agreement and contain sovereign commitment by both the uk and irish governments the new trouble bill will reform the independent commission to be rename the legacy commission give it statutory oversight to provide accountability and confidence and learn from operation kenova statutory victim and survivor advisory group it will significantly strengthen the governance of the commission with two co director of investigation statutory conflict of interest duty and appointment make only follow independent advice it will enhance the investigative power of the commission and put in place fair disclosure regime ensure that the commission have the power that it need to find answer for family and can make public the maximum possible information consistent with the state responsibility to protect life and national security the bill will fulfil the commitment that we have make to restore the small number of trouble relate inquest that be stop in their track by the legacy act and refer the other inquest that have not yet commence to the solicitor general for independent consideration of whether in each case they be deal with most appropriately by the reform legacy commission or via the coronial system it will enable the reform commission to hold new proceeding in case that be transfer to it from the coronial system consistent with the provision in the inquiries act that will provide for public hearing the consideration of sensitive information in closed hearing and effective next of kin participation include participation through legal representation we will also address in the bill rather than in the remedial order the uk supreme court ruling in the adams interim custody order case regard the application of the carltona principle we must put beyond doubt parliament intention by clarify the fact that the relevant legislation allow such order to be make by junior ministers as well as by the secretary of state we owe huge debt of gratitude to the northern ireland veteran who serve with honour and distinction to keep people safe and who work with the police and other emergency service in the most difficult circumstance imaginable their service and their sacrifice will never be forget that be why have work closely with the defence secretary and the armed forces minister the government be introduce strong safeguard for veteran that respond directly to the concern that have be express to we those safeguard will also apply to other people such as former police officer they will mean that no witness will need to travel to northern ireland to engage with legacy mechanism they will have right to do so remotely because coroner and judge in the commission will be legally require to allow it and support for veteran will be available to assist they in that regard the commission will be under duty not to duplicate aspect of any previous investigation unless there be compelling reason that make it essential the welfare of veteran will be give proper consideration as part of any assessment of whether they be require to give evidence and that will include the right of veteran to seek anonymity when do so our protection will not be limit to legislation any contact with veteran will be facilitate through the ministry of defence protect veteran from cold calling and veteran will not be require to rehearse the historical context surround incident when such information can be obtain from other source include the ministry of defence these measure will provide what the three uk veteran commissioner have call for not immunity from the law but fairness under it the remedial order which be also lay today will remove the last government much criticise immunity scheme which offer false promise be never introduce and would have enable those who have commit the most appalling terrorist crime to be grant immunity from prosecution the principal reason why the act be so strongly oppose in northern ireland and it will lift the current prohibition on trouble relate civil proceeding be grateful to the tánaiste simon harris and his team for their open and constructive approach in reach the framework agreement which recognise that help family affect by the trouble be shared responsibility that be why the joint framework contain specific and unprecedented commitment by the irish government to facilitate the full possible co operation of the irish authority with reform legacy commission to establish dedicated unit within an garda síochána to deal with trouble relate case which will include investigate all outstanding case in ireland and to make financial contribution of million to help fund legacy mechanism that is of course in addition to the million already commit by the uk government where require legislation will be introduce by the irish government to implement those commitment we be also establish with the irish government an independent commission on information retrieval initially on pilot basis to give family an additional mean of obtain information since my appointment last year have have many discussion with political party victim and survivor organisation human right group veteran and other affect by the trouble give the view hold by so many people often diametrically opposed it be always go to be impossible to set out plan that give everyone everything that they want there will be element of our approach that some people will welcome and other will not also recognise that because of what have go before there be great lack of trust in all of we in the house on the part of victim and survivor that is unfortunately the reality but it be not and it never have be an argument for not try to find way forward hope that those who want to see fair and effective approach to legacy that can command great support in northern ireland will recognise that these measure represent fundamental reform and that they will therefore be give chance to succeed time wait for no one least of all for the many family who lose love one and they ultimately will be the judge of whether these new arrangement can give they the answer that they have seek for so long hope that we will together be able to grasp this opportunity and so help the people of northern ireland to look to future free of the burden of the past commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement the last government legislate to draw line under trouble era litigation that litigation be inevitably weight against those who seek to protect our country from terrorism it be inevitably weight against those who keep record and whose servicemen be easy to locate and contact even today vexatious claim be be make only last week judicial review of case be rightly throw out by the high court in belfast the judge describe the challenge as utterly divorce from reality but not before the former special force soldier at the centre of it have have to endure four year of investigation mindful of case such as this the last government seek to draw line through their action today this government be erase that line and as they do so many former servicemen will again feel with profound unease that the lawyer be come hope the house will spare thought for they this afternoon know we will have lot of time to debate the legislation that the government be lay but there be number of specific question that would like to ask the secretary of state first on the resumption of inquest will he tell the house how many inquest will be restore and how many will be refer to the solicitor general can he specifically tell the house whether that list will include the loughgall case secondly civil case be to reopen it be think that at the time of prohibition many hundred of such case affect perhaps thousand of people be before the belfast court what be the northern ireland office calculation of the number of civil case that be now likely to proceed ask that because there be clear financial consequence to reopen legacy in this way the secretary of state refer to the million already commit indeed it be commit by the last government to deal with the legacy as we frame it but it be now clear that the new legacy commission be to have much big remit than the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery if so will its budget be increase if not how will it be expect to function similarly the police service of northern ireland have raise very serious concern about the amount of money that it will need to support reopen inquest and civil case policy exchange have place the cost on the police at around million at time when police number in northern ireland be at an all time low there be very real prospect that without additional funding from the secretary of state frontline policing in northern ireland will be far reduce can the secretary of state make commitment that that will not happen thirdly the government have today brief journalist that legislation will ban gerry adams from receive compensation for his detention in the but the secretary of state statement make no reference to that can he tell the house unequivocally that mr adams will not receive one penny of compensation fourthly the secretary of state list number of protection for veteran in court but it be already the case that anonymity age relate consideration and remote hearing be available at the discretion of the court that be apparent to the tánaiste on september when he emphasise that no new protection would be available to veteran do the secretary of state agree with mr harris there have also be some confusion about whether these protection will extend to paramilitary on september the prime minister claim that they will not can the secretary of state be definitive for the house lastly there be the question of the involvement of the republic of ireland in legacy this have prove deeply controversial and be sure that the secretary of state will be ask question about it this afternoon however be interested to see that the republic have make commitment to get the garda to investigate unresolved trouble relate incident within its jurisdiction and to legislate to enable the full possible co operation of the relevant irish authority with the legacy commission if that be to happen it be to be welcome because during the trouble the uk repeatedly seek extradition from the republic to bring terrorist charge in the vast majority of case they be turn down follow the former irish justice minister michael mcdowell say that the irish government give de facto amnesty to the ira indeed there be many instance of possible collusion between the garda and the provisional ira which have never receive the attention they deserve kingsmill the murder of ian sproule bloody friday teebane la mon the list go on sincerely hope that the republic will now engage sincerely deeply and honestly and hope the secretary of state will ensure that it do be grateful to the hon gentleman for his response he say that the last government seek to draw line but it do not work in the act of seek to do that this be the one question that the now opposition have never be able to answer they decide that they would give terrorist immunity from prosecution hon member no they do yes that be what the last government do and have never hear justification hon member no they do yes they do and it do not work it do not have support in northern ireland how can northern ireland proceed to deal with the legacy of the trouble when the legislation that the last government pass have no support in northern ireland to answer the hon gentleman specific question nine inquest will be restore and the remain will go into the sifting process those nine inquest will include loughgall because the conservative attorney general order new inquest into loughgall year ago point never refer to by the opposition it be one of the case that have begin and it therefore fall within the group that will be restore the rest will be consider by the solicitor general in the sifting process the number of civil case will depend on those who choose to bring they or resume they on the psni say to the hon gentleman that prior to may last year the force have over case on its book and that be no long the case the legacy commission which the uk government be fund be now responsible for look at all case refer to it that cost be bear by the uk government and not by the department of justice in northern ireland to the extent that case be no long inquest but will go to the commission the cost will be bear by the uk government and not by the department of justice in northern ireland on the issue of interim custody order as indicate to the house moment ago the legislation will make it clear that the signing of those order by junior ministers be always lawful but we have also decide in place draft remedial order before the house today that section and of the legacy act will now remain in place until the provision of the bill take effect that will deal with the point that some people have make about avoid gap but we all have to recognise that section and prove to be an ineffective way of deal with this issue the hon gentleman smile but he know that that be the case on the protection we have bring in for veteran we have do so with the motivation of protect veteran on the involvement of the republic of ireland join the hon gentleman point of unity at the end in welcome the commitment of the irish government to this partnership the history of northern ireland teach we that lot of progress be make when the two guarantor of the good friday agreement work together and many people in northern ireland would like to get answer from the garda and the irish authority at the moment the irish government be refuse to co operate why because of the last government legacy act look forward to the irish government participate in the process in the month and year ahead call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee be pleased to see from the joint framework that the government have listen to some of the key concern voice by stakeholder during my committee inquiry into legacy those stakeholder will no doubt want to study the detail of the proposal that my right hon friend be publish today to that end what consultation have the government have with victim and survivor group since the joint framework be announce and in what way have this inform the legislation lay today the legislation be about to be publish but in the month since take up this post have have many conversation with family victim and the other organisation and group that list in my statement the bill that the house will see be the result of that process of discussion listening draft and attempt to respond not in way that will please everyone to the mess that this government be leave by the last government who pass piece of legislation that do not work do not have support and be find by the court not to be compatible with our obligation in number of respect the question now for all those group have see the framework agreement that we have reach with the irish government be do they feel that the legislation give effect to that and will it enable northern ireland to move forward in deal with these really intractable problem call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement as this be my first statement as the liberal democrat spokesperson for northern ireland want to begin by recognise the deep scar leave by the trouble on family and community across the island of ireland and these island the pain loss and legacy of that conflict remain deeply feel to this day although the liberal democrats welcome the recent agreement between the british and irish governments the true test of this deal will lie in the detail of the legislation that follow the government state intention to promote an honest attempt at reconciliation and to draw line under decade of division be one that every member of this house can understand victim family deserve truth justice and closure equally our veteran deserve and must be afford fairness and protection from injustice as the secretary of state have say the legacy act introduce by the conservatives fail to gain the support of any of the party in stormont victim group or the irish government this lack of consensus speak volume but be not loud enough it seem for his majesty official opposition look forward to examine the content of the new bill in detail and to table constructive amendment my party will engage fully with the government as last reconciliation depend on transparency fairness and independent oversight that mean an effective information retrieval body with statutory disclosure power meaningful participation for victim and safeguard to uphold both justice and compassion for veteran and victim alike have three question for the secretary of state first how will this bill ensure that reconciliation be not impose from above but build from the ground up secondly base on the many meeting my party have have with veteran and their representative what specific safeguard will the government include to ensure fairness proportionality and proper protection for those who serve with integrity lastly how will this government ensure that prosecution under the law or the possibility of it can never be use to harm oppress or discredit those who fight for our country regardless of the final verdict welcome the hon gentleman to his new role and genuinely look forward to work with he on these and other matter give his interest in northern ireland which be share right across the house let turn to his three specific question first no legislation can enable people to feel reconcile in some way to what happen in the end reconciliation have to come from within the title reconciliation will not be in the new name of the legacy commission because it be consequence of process that we be try to put in place if family can find answer urge the house to concentrate on that because that be what this be all about try to enable family to find answer secondly do draw attention to the safeguard in my statement and when the bill be publish later the hon gentleman will be able to see how they be give legal expression lastly on the hon gentleman point about prosecution would simply say that people have make one or two comment in these discussion about politically motivated prosecution or vexatious prosecution think it be very important that the house uphold the integrity and independence of the prosecutorial authority fundamental bedrock of our legal system be that independent prosecutor make such decision and to suggest that they be in any way politically motivated be in my view profoundly mistaken pay tribute to the secretary of state the defence secretary and the minister for the armed forces for work so hard to achieve this new phase of the peace settlement in northern ireland as we celebrate peace start in the middle east this statement be reminder of how long it take to build peace and how important justice be for peace do the secretary of state agree with that by shut down investigation include into the death of more than operation banner soldier without an adequate alternative the unlawful legacy act fail so many family and victim of the trouble and the mess have to be undo thank my hon friend for her question but above all for her great service in the northern ireland office it be real pleasure to work with she and she do so much during her time in the department do agree with my hon friend because those service family want to find answer some time ago meet the family of tony harrison who serve and be murder in belfast his mother and his brother tell how outraged they be by the legacy act because it propose that those who have kill her son could get immunity from prosecution it be so important that we put that misguided approach on one side so that all family service family and other can find answer it be worth remember that most victim be not in group be not in the medium and be not take action they just want to know what happen to their love one as we debate the forthcoming legislation hope we can all collectively remember that because investigation be key to deliver for those family want to ask the secretary of state two specific question first there be some concern that there will be protection for combatant who may have be involve in rape and other sexual activity could he look at that as the bill proceed to make sure that victim be able to talk and have protection as those ex combatant have secondly what think have he give to change of government in the south should sinn féin take power and to the delivery of the irish contribution and commitment in such scenario be grateful as ever to the right hon gentleman for his wise word and once again pay tribute to the distinguished role he play in try to move forward some of these and many other northern ireland question during his time as secretary of state on the latter point it be not for to speculate on what be go to happen as result of the decision of the irish electorate the current coalition government have give commitment and this partnership be two government come together each make sovereign commitment and promise to carry they out in their own jurisdiction think it be hugely significant moment because we have to go back year to the last such time when the last government be able to reach agreement with the irish government in the form of the stormont house agreement on the first question when the right hon gentleman see the bill he will see that we be make change to allow some other matter to be investigate because be conscious of the point he have raise welcome the statement and the progress make by both this government and the government of the republic of ireland as my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi say we on the northern ireland affairs committee have hear of the heartbreak of many of those who lose love one over the course of the trouble and regardless of the background of those love one they deserve answer the response we have consistently receive be that operation kenova be an example of good practice that many of those in the island of ireland be too close to this matter and bring in suitably qualified individual from other part of the uk should be consider as part of any process can ask the secretary of state if that have be consider in the new bill would make two point first as have allude to we have draw on the experience of operation kenova in that the bill will create statutory victim and survivor advisory group to ensure that in the way it go about its work the commission take account of victim and survivor and that will include representative of those who serve the state during the trouble on the second point we be put together much tough statutory provision in place relate to conflict of interest that be why there will be two director of investigation one will have experience of investigate case in northern ireland the other will not which will address the concern some family have about who will be look into their case we should not forget that despite the nearly case that the commission be currently investigate which welcome far too many family in northern ireland have say that they will not be go anywhere near the commission part of the purpose of what we be seek to do be to build confidence on the part of more family in northern ireland to go to the commission and get answer first welcome the minister to his place and to the department and welcome the new shadow spokesperson for the liberal democrats personally thank the hon member for putney fleur anderson for the role she play in her time in the northern ireland office that the announcement with the irish government be make during house of commons recess one could consider as cynical that we stand here today during statement on legislation that have yet to be introduce and therefore we have no detail on as disgraceful and the suggestion that the irish government have commit to legislate at all as entirely fanciful they have not but the detail we do have be that the secretary of state wish for the solicitor general to be the person to carry out the sifting process on whether case should go to inquest through the coronial system or to the legacy commission in northern ireland we have an advocate general the advocate general be england and wales attorney general be clear in my mind that richard hermer would be wholly inappropriate to have his hand anywhere near case touch on the legacy of the past give how he have conflict himself will the secretary of state indicate have the attorney general of this country recuse himself from this process have he as secretary of state decide to exclude the attorney general from this process be he legislate in way that will exclude every attorney general from this process or be it just richard hermer would say to the right hon gentleman that be sorry to have hear what he have just say in relation to very substantial proposal contain in the framework document grant he that the bill will be publish shortly and he will have chance to read it have be accuse of many thing in my time in public life but be cynical be not one of they so that be first the truth about the announcement of the well it may be the beginning of number of such accusation but will leave that to other who want to take the debate in that particular direction the framework be announce when it be because it be joint framework between two government and that mean there have to be negotiation about when it come out but do undertake to mr speaker at the time that would come to the house as quickly as possible to make statement lay write ministerial statement in the house yesterday and come today at the first available opportunity with member here bear in mind the whip we have yesterday to subject what have agree to scrutiny have every confidence in the solicitor general and be sure she will do an excellent job in sift these case against three criterion which will be lay out in statute the first will be about the impact that sensitive information will have on the ability of inquest to actually complete the case the second will be speed time wait for no one the third will be the view of those who be involve in the case include family thank the secretary of state for his statement and welcome the government focus on protection package for veteran last week meet david ishbel and gary from yateley and hawley royal british legion who do an excellent job support veteran in my community we discuss the new veterans protection package announce by the government include the protection against repeat investigation many veteran from my constituency serve courageously for our nation in very very difficult condition and they ask to raise number of question on behalf of veteran who serve in northern ireland how will the government ensure that the protection be absolutely watertight in practice so that veteran be not subject to repeat distressing investigation in old age what step be be take with the irish government and other partner to ensure that accountability and justice be apply consistently and fairly on all side thank my hon friend for her question she be such strong advocate for the many veteran she represent encourage she to look at the legislation to see the nature of the legislative commitment to give effect to the veteran protection there will be couple that will not be in legislation because they be entirely in our own hand agree protocol with the commission to ensure that there be no cold calling would like to take this opportunity to welcome my new deputy the under secretary of state for northern ireland my hon friend the member for wirral west matthew patrick to the house it be very remiss of not to have do so this be the first chance we have have to sit together on the front bench pay tribute to the minister for the armed forces my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns from the ministry of defence who have play really important and significant role in put the protection in place note that lieutenant general sir nick pope the chair of the confederation of service charities have say that the confederation welcome the development of the safeguard that have be put in place to offer protection to those within the armed force community who be affect by legacy issue too welcome that recognition of what we have do obviously the devil lie in the detail in these thing and never more so than in northern ireland before the bill come eventually before we we really can not say for certain whether it be good bad or indifferent as be often the case will raise two point first will mention the agreement find it little wishy washy over ireland role in all this which as have be say by my hon friend have huge amount of history attach to it give that ireland have previously refuse to hand over people who really be guilty of the most vexatious disgusting attack on civilian and soldier it do seem to rather peculiar we will wait and see what that actually mean ireland say it be commit would love to see what that commitment actually mean secondly will mention vexatious prosecution the note we have here talk about protection from repeat investigation unless there be compelling reason to do so my concern with thing like that be that they be little hook that allow development through legislation instead of be powerful tool to do what the secretary of state say therefore urge he right now to be very clear when this legislation come forward that this can not be break through and to tie down the definition of compelling note the right hon gentleman point about the past and be not go to dissent from what he say but this be an attempt to move beyond the past and the history and to move forward to something that be well in the end people will judge the commitment that this government and the irish government have make but the deal have be sign in good faith and we be commit to do what we promise to do the commission be establish by the previous government after all and take the decision not to abolish it but to reform it many people criticise that they want it scrap completely and for we to start again but think that would have be mistake because time wait for no one we would have waste all the money and stop the investigation that be take place which be really important to the family every single investigation be important to every single family because each be about the death of love one be sure we will debate the specific of the legislation at length in the house the state have duty of course to properly investigate case where it have be involve in death the right hon gentleman be well aware of that it be duty that all of we should uphold thank the secretary of state and his team for their work on this package include the hon member for putney fleur anderson who be so well regard by everybody who come across she in northern ireland also thank the official in the department of foreign affairs in dublin for their work because that partnership be vital to move forward the social democratic and labour party acknowledge the progress in this package if it be faithfully capture in the legislation when we push for more and well please know that that come from sincere and long hold determination to get this right for family survivor and our society as whole despite some opinion to the contrary include recently do not believe that most people believe that any murder in northern ireland be justify inevitable useful or worthy of cover up and perpetuate those narrative be an enormous challenge for the present and the future too do the secretary of state agree that all the work invest by family campaigner and his official will be worth nothing if those who create victim whether republican or loyalist paramilitary or the state force who assist they do not approach this with full transparency and disclosure and put honesty and the need of victim over the need of their own narrative my hon friend give the opportunity to pay tribute to my extraordinary official some of whom be present today it have be the privilege of my life to work with they on this know that my hon friend will hold we to the high standard and accept what she say in the spirit in which it be offer as indicate to the house early want there to be maximum provision of information to family but we must also acknowledge that any and all government have responsibility for the security of the state and to protect life and this government will uphold both welcome the hon member for wirral west matthew patrick to his ministerial position and welcome my hon friend the member for wimbledon mr kohler to his new place as spokesperson frankly the good job anybody could have in opposition have spend the summer speak to veteran about the vital commitment they need to feel that the process of prosecution do not become persecution while many of those veteran recognise that they go to northern ireland in order to restore the rule of law and think that they should be subject to the law of this land they none the less remain incredibly anxious about the possibility that the process of prosecution become persecution have the secretary of state have the official backing of any veteran group for the approach that he have take separately have he have any assurance from the republic of ireland government that they will as result of the publication of this bill drop the inter state case against the united kingdom thank the hon gentleman for the role he play as liberal democrat spokesperson for northern ireland the truth be that with the passage of time the possibility of prosecution become increasingly remote we all know that to be the case most of the family have meet not all but most have say know that no one be go to be hold to account through the judicial process but just want to know what happen that what want it cause such pain and grief that that answer can not be provide it really be difficult as far as the irish government be concern believe that they will honour the promise they have make this partnership with the irish government be significant moment because move from non co operation to co operation will open up the possibility for more information to come to family the inter state case be matter for the irish government but be very clear of one thing which be that the last legacy act create circumstance in which the law that be not compatible with our international obligation and that be the basis of the inter state case the legislation be bring before the house will fix that and deal with it and in those circumstance the inter state case will no long have basis thank the secretary of state for his statement today particularly his focus on answer which be what people want as someone who lose friend tim parry when he be murder by the ira in know exactly how important it be for family and everyone who know victim to get the answer that they deserve the agreement be vital in get the process move again so that victim and family can get those answer how will the secretary of state continue that work with family and victim both during the process of the legislation and afterwards to make sure that answer remain at the heart of what the government be try to achieve be grateful to my hon friend for what he have say speak yesterday to the victim commissioner in northern ireland on september when the framework be publish the tánaiste and meet the victim and survivor forum in northern ireland and explain what the framework seek to do make commitment to the victim commissioner yesterday that will come back to meet the victim and survivor forum once it have have chance to look at the legislation to find out what it think in the interest of try to solve this issue wish the secretary of state well and hope that he will bring forward the bill and deal with its progress in the spirit of compromise and co operation between the party to find the good landing spot possible he mention good faith which be precious resource that be often in short supply when it come to this issue think it would be helpful if he work vigorously with the irish government to get they to ascertain at speed and pace what if any legislative measure they require to make good on what they have commit to and could he as well as possible work those two piece of legislation in lockstep to give confidence to both side who have concern when it come to good faith or rather the absence of it thank the hon gentleman for what he say hope he know that will do anything and everything can to try to find way forward in partnership with as many member of the house as possible for long period of time this question have be subject to the bipartisanship which in the main have characterise relation between the party in the house on matter to do with northern ireland recognise that there be disagreement in relation to one aspect of what we be put forward that do not mean that we can not work together on the other take the hon gentleman point about the importance of see the legislation require in ireland to give effect to the proposal be stand next to the tánaiste when he make it quite clear to give an example that he would ensure legislation be in place to deal with the commitment to enable witness to give evidence to the omagh public inquiry before the hearing resume in march that seem to be an important example of good faith suppose that the secretary of state will forgive some of we for be cautious before we be ready to believe that the government the state and any paramilitary organisation will give over the information that be require in fact right now there be family across the road in the supreme court in legal dispute with the government because the government be withhold information from they we know that there be pattern when it come to inquest will the secretary of state look again at the sifting process will he give family view primacy when it come to decide which case will have an inquest will he drop his proposal to give himself the power to appoint judge in that inquisitorial mechanism the important principle of the independence of the judiciary need to be hold up on inquest there be three statutory test that the solicitor general will have to apply in answer to an early question indicate what they be family view will be one of the consideration but if inquest can not proceed because of sensitive information would it not be more sensible to put it into the commission which can deal with sensitive information because it have provision for closed hearing no doubt my hon friend will make the point about appointment process when we come to discuss the bill however on the agreement on the information retrieval mechanism point out this be also relevant to the point make by the opposition that that be negotiate by the previous conservative government and the irish government and it form part of the stormont house agreement what be the purpose of it it be to enable those who have information to pass it to the body which can then pass it to the family and that information will be protect disclosure which be not the same as immunity that system have work well through the independent commission for the location of victim remain in recover quite number of the remain of those who be abduct torture murder and bury by the ira hope that it be step forward in go back to what be agree at stormont house by the previous government the irish government and the political party well not all of they and will be welcome on all side the secretary of state refer to this as unfinished business in the last statement we hear about the success of the peace process in northern ireland be year old when the good friday agreement be sign now stand here year of age as the mp for lagan valley and my constituent deserve truth and justice as much as anybody else we have hear lot today about veteran my family be part of that cohort they proudly serve along with many other they do not want an amnesty they do not want immunity they do not want equivocation with terrorist which be propose by the outgoing government we hear about people in northern ireland who be in the wrong place at the wrong time whenever they die they be not it be the terrorist who be in the wrong place do the wrong work we must send out clear signal no matter what our political opinion that terrorism be wrong in the past and be wrong now will the secretary of state give his guarantee that he will discuss that with the northern ireland executive and my ministerial colleague to ensure that those family who so rightfully deserve truth and justice have the resource to be able to get that may say to the hon member that agree with every single word that she have express so powerfully and forcefully encourage those who have be chuntere from sedentary position during the course of these exchange to reflect on her point that there be many people who say they do not want immunity and they certainly object to it be give to those who commit the most appalling crime voice in northern ireland really need to be listen to the failure to do that include under the last legacy act be why make the point that there have be terrible lack of trust in politician over long period of time will not make party point but there be terrible lack of trust in politician because there have be attempt before and they have not work we have to try to make this work and have already begin the process of talk to the hon member colleague in the northern ireland executive follow the last question want to say that the tory immunity system would have mean immunity for the perpetrator of terrorist crime across the uk our domestic court have determine that do the secretary of state agree that this government have no choice but to rectify the situation agree with my hon friend who make the point extremely forcefully it do not work and it be never deliverable there never be immunity it be false promise make to veteran who be badly let down and badly serve by the last government whoever win the election last year would have have to deal with the mess that we have inherit and that be what we seek to do in march of this year it be widely report that the secretary of state give his word to mairead kelly the sister of ira murderer patrick kelly that there would be an inquest on the loughgall incident be this remedial order fulfilment of that promise if so it mean that year on the government be drag veteran into court over an operation that stop eight heavily armed ira murderer man who have already kill and who be on their way to kill again with weapon that have be use in previous murder let we be clear by stop the attack those soldier prevent the murder of many more innocent northern ireland citizen what justice be serve by punish those brave soldier with stressful and unnecessary process the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton describe it as persecution punish they for do nothing more than their duty be this really what the secretary of state intend the fact be that this government be elect on commitment there be lot of opposition to the ending of inquest under the legacy act maybe not from the right hon gentleman but from lot of people in northern ireland the government come in committed to restore the inquest that have start and be stop the reason that say what say be because loughgall as have already indicate to the shadow secretary of state be one of those nine case it be for the independent coronial system to take decision about that but one of the factor that coroner have to take into account be how they will deal with any sensitive information that be provide we know from other inquest that there have be number of case when the coroner have say that they accept that the information can not see the light of day they have examine the public interest immunity certificate and have reach the conclusion that they can not take the case any far in those circumstance the sensible thing would be for case to move into the commission where sensitive information can be consider welcome the secretary of state commitment to new protection for veteran will he update the house on the discussion that he and ministry of defence ministers have have with veteran and their representative group about the measure the minister for the armed forces the defence secretary and have have many such discussion the measure that have announce that will be contain in the bill and the other non legislative measure be the result of those discussion we have listen very carefully to the concern express by veteran and we have come forward with what we think be fair reasonable and balanced package of measure that will provide protection while also take forward our responsibility to enable family include force family to find answer be against the repealing of the legacy act and serve in northern ireland as be now do in opposition raise when we be in government the major concern and dishonour when none of those on the labour benches have the decency to come to this house and debate all the point the minister be make now they let the legislation go through but it be record in hansard that very few people bother to come to the chamber to debate it when we take it through the house want to make two quick point on the support for veteran first you have speak about the process they will have to go through want to know what support will be available as you have mention secondly give that the terrorist do not keep record but the british army do how will you ensure fair disclosure throughout the process order remind member not to refer to you as that mean be grateful to the hon member for his point support be available for veteran through the ministry of defence and the armed forces minister be very committed to make sure that veteran get all the support they need which be in part reflect in the package we have announce on disclosure we be make number of change include amend the definition of sensitive information so that it be not designate by virtue of the body that hold it that be one of the reason why the court find that the disclosure arrangement be not compatible with our commitment the secretary of state will have to conduct balance exercise on what should be disclose the secretary of state will be require to give reason for any decision not to disclose to the extent that that do not risk harm to national security and of course any decision that the secretary of state make can be subject to judicial review thank the secretary of state for his statement and for the way he and the minister for the armed forces have engage on this matter in recent month have many constituent veteran in sunderland central who serve with distinction in operation banner the secretary of state rightly praise the professionalism and service of our armed force in that operation and welcome the protection he have set out today may press he bit more on the need for continue work with veteran group so that as the protection be be implement there will be process of ongoing review to ensure that they provide effective protection from vexatious lawfare be very happy to give my hon friend that assurance we have make these commitment because we want they to work and the government be determined to ensure that that be the case on that assurance from the secretary of state about the protection for veteran on september he stand beside the irish government when he make this announcement and later that evening the tánaiste simon harris go on irish medium and clearly say that there be no add protection for veteran in the legacy deal will the secretary of state give assurance to the house be there protection for veteran in this legacy deal or not when the hon gentleman see the legislation he will see that the protection that we have say will be back by legislation be in the legislation in addition to that there be the provision relate to cold calling and on not require veteran to rehearse the historical context when it be possible for someone from the ministry of defence for example to do that to assist both inquest and the commission as the secretary of state know be member of the joint committee on human rights and we have be very engaged in this issue not least because of the ruling of our court that the previous government attempt to legislate on this issue be unlawful because it would potentially grant immunity to among other terrorist that be no way to serve justice to family and victim and it be no way to serve justice to our veteran will the secretary of state confirm that the legislation we be bring forward will not grant immunity to terrorist that be simple request and it be remarkable that have to make it but give the legislation that the previous government attempt to pass it be important to have it on the record be very happy to give my hon friend that assurance the legislation be pass it be never commence it be strike down by the court and the remedial order will remove it from the statute book because we do not agree with give immunity to terrorist we do not agree with the principle of immunity because we believe as hope the whole house believe in the rule of law be surprised that no one have mention the letter of comfort that be give to the ira and the question of whether or not they still hold water but let go back to what the secretary of state say about the possibility of ira boss like gerry adams claim compensation on technical ground that the wrong minister sign their internment paper as understand it from what the secretary of state say early the remedial order that he be lay before parliament will open up the possibility of such people sue the government for compensation which the new legacy legislation that he be bring in will nevertheless then rule out he refer to possible gap between the new legislation come into force and the remedial order open the gap it have be suggest to that the government be brief the press that the remedial order will not actually be vote on until the new legacy bill have go through parliament be that his policy and if not what be his policy the aim of the remedial order be to remove from the statute book provision in the previous legislation that have be find to be incompatible with our obligation would just say that the letter of comfort do not offer immunity that have be quite clear from lady justice hallett review and what the chief constable and other have say want to reassure the right hon gentleman on the interim custody order the supreme court judgment be in the last government do not know what to do about that it be not judgment that the government expect and they do not know how to deal with the question of potential compensation in the end two member of the other house introduce what be now section and they be vote on but they be subsequently find to be ineffective in achieve the objective when the court say that they be incompatible what have just tell the house be that the new draft remedial order will not remove they from the statute book section and will remain in place until such time as the new legislation be introduce take effect it be flimsy defence because it have already be find by the court to be ineffective but it will remain in place it show that have listen to the representation that be make about section and and it be place in the remedial order be now go to deal with the problem by legislation in the way that set out score if not hundred of people in northern ireland lose their life because of the safe base and the haven that the republic of ireland offer their ira murderer that be where they have their arm dump that be where they have their training camp and that be where they return to for sanctuary safe in the knowledge that extradition would invariably be refuse yet it be with the government of that territory that the secretary of state have choose to co design these proposal he do not co design they with the innocent victim of terrorism he choose to co design they with the government of the territory that facilitate the victim maker why then should any innocent victim have any confidence in these proposal particularly as they still require nothing meaningful from the republic of ireland there be tentative promise that if necessary there will be co operation but there be no apology for the republic role in facilitate terrorism for year do the secretary of state even seek an apology publicly from the republic of ireland that be the same government who to this day continue with an inter state action against this government how could any of this proposal command widespread support when that be its genealogy say to the hon and learn gentleman that we can remain stuck in the past and think of thousand reason why this be good enough and we should do this or we should do the other the responsibility on the house be to try to find way of move forward because the fact that so many family do not have answer be product of if may say so people be stick in the past and we need to move beyond that the hon and learn gentleman be mistaken if may gently chide he in say that these proposal have be co design with the irish government have say already that would have take these step regardless of whether we reach an agreement with the irish government because the mess leave to we by the last government force whoever be in office now to deal with the consequence of piece of legislation that do not work but will agree with he on one thing in the end it will be the family who will decide whether this new approach allow they to find the answer can not say too many time that that be what really matter in all this because it be those family who have influence more than anyone else in the discussion have have the young man send out to do the state business during the trouble be now old man often sick often disabled some of they be my constituent they will be listen carefully to the secretary of state and will be hear honey word they will be read those word in this framework document even as the protection give by the legacy act be strip away from they and they listen for the metaphorical knock on the door as activist leave liberal human right lawyer construct open and reopen case that will do they in in their fail year be that what the secretary of state want be this not beanfeast for lawyer be it any wonder that no veteran group have come out to support the framework that he have announce today have great respect for the right hon member and his service both as minister and in our armed force gently say to he that protection be not be strip away because they never exist in the first place it be important for the house to appreciate this the provision that be pass in the legacy act be never commence they be then strike down by the court they do not exist they never have exist interruption that be just fact nobody have be grant immunity because the provision of that act have never ever be apply one can not strip away something that never exist in the first place be afraid what the last government do be to offer false promise to veteran one of the consequence of the widespread failure of the legacy act be court case after court case where people have say well we need to find another mean of get an answer to the question about what happen to our love one that involve expensive court case be under an order to establish public inquiry into one case it be think the phrase have be use legal wild west that the legislation open up and we be try to put thing back together again the secretary of state indicate that the government be introduce what he describe as strong safeguard and he say that the legacy commission will be under duty not to duplicate aspect of any previous investigation unless there be compelling reason that make it essential what will he do when not if but when the republic of ireland government come under severe pressure from other source to make compelling reason to he that there have to be something investigate that the person who be the subject of that investigation believe they would be exclude from what will he do then the hon gentleman for whom have great respect ask what be in fairness totally hypothetical question interruption well it be hypothetical question the fact be that it will be for the commission to interpret the legal obligation that will be place upon it by the legislation which refer to such reinvestigation be essential ultimately the commission will judge and if people do not like the way in which it have interpret thing they have remedy available to they in judicial review as veteran be deeply concerned by the government dog pursuit of this legislation which have the support neither of northern ireland veteran nor of veteran in my generation who have concern about their own service in iraq and afghanistan what guarantee can the secretary of state give the british public that this legislation will achieve justice and that terrorist guilty of the murder of british service personnel will now be hold to account how many case do he believe will be reopen in order to pursue ira terrorist in the way that british personnel be now vulnerable to be pursue thank the hon gentleman for his service if he look at the nearly case that the commission be currently investigate he will find that they include the guilford pub bombing the coach bombing and the kingsmill massacre the commission have the power it need in this respect pay tribute to the previous government to get the information require to do the job of investigate have meet the investigator can say that they be very committed to their task the family who have choose to refer the case which be what have govern the case that the commission be look at have say please can you look at this want more family to do that so that more of they get answer if the hon gentleman look at the number of case he will see that it reflect in reasonable measure who be actually responsible for the vast majority of death in northern ireland do the secretary of state agree that this government continue hounding of our brave northern ireland veteran many of whom should be enjoy well earn retirement after their loyal service to the british government not live in fear of prosecution for simply follow order be nothing short of shameful the government do not wish to see anybody hound we have put these protection in place precisely because we have listen to the concern that veteran have express to to the defence secretary and to the minister for the armed forces give one example of veteran welcome the fact that we be put the protection in place would ask people to look at the protection when the legislation be present and to understand that what say about the risk of prosecution diminish rapidly over time be look back over recent year reflect in what the fact tell we will the secretary of state set out how many of the proposed six protection for veteran will also be available to former paramilitary when they introduce immunity the previous government say that it would apply not just to veteran but to other include terrorist and that be what the legislation do in those circumstance there be provision that apply to witness but the reason for the package be the determination of the government to protect veteran the hon member will see that number of those protection be lay out in the legislation other will be step that the ministry of defence will take like the prime minister the secretary of state should stop use the phrase the legislation be strike down by the court the court have no such power as jack straw make clear from the dispatch box declaration of incompatibility be no more than declaration it place no obligation or expectation on parliament but may thank the secretary of state for at least listen to my representation in delay the repeal of section and of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act until the new legislation be in place of course he be do so because they be effective otherwise there would be no point in delay their repeal would there suppose should take that praise from the right hon gentleman at face value the fact be that section and be find to be incompatible but have listen and hope members of the house will find willing to listen must however correct he because when it come to the immunity provision they be find to be incompatible and he be correct in what he describe but they be also strike down under article of the windsor framework that be why they be not operational it be no secret that have major concern over the legacy bill not least that innocent victim be preclude from take their path to justice what seem to be before we now be carte blanche for political inquiry and yet no hope for the kingsmill family it instead highlight the role of the irish government in british matter after their continue refusal to engage and their collusion to protect ira murderer across the border in the penultimate paragraph of his statement the secretary of state say that the many family who lose love one will be the judge of whether these new arrangement can give they the answer that they have seek for so long quite clearly that will not be the case for many family and the secretary of state will know that member of my family be murder on december it show that the government have no heart for the victim but have an ear instead for the victim maker do the secretary of state not understand why these feeling exist when will he put right thinking and good people of the province above be see to be politically correct by the enemy of peace and justice in northern ireland my family seek justice and do not see it on the other side for all the other family that represent and that we all represent we seek that justice but not within this the hon gentleman have speak before most powerfully and movingly about the impact that the death of family member have have upon he he exemplify if may say so what so many people in northern ireland say when they meet we and talk to we some will open up and some will weep and some will not be able to open their mouth to describe what happen because the pain run so deep after all these year we be try to create mechanism and means of enable every single family who want to come forward and say can you please look at this case and see if we can find more information to do that the hon gentleman refer to the kingsmill massacre as have already indicate to the house that be one of the case that the commission be currently look into there be the inqu verdict and we know what it find will simply say to the house that probably the most difficult conversation have have since take up this post be to listen to the sole survivor of the kingsmill massacre alan black describe to exactly what happen on that dark and dreadful night personally do not have great deal of faith in this government or previous government on issue to do with legacy can the secretary of state give assurance that in address the legacy of the northern ireland trouble terrorist will not be allow to rewrite history and that our history will be record truthfully with the focus on innocent victim rather than on those who commit act of terrorism can he far reassure that veteran will not be chase for prosecution vexatiously can he also reassure give that irish governments for year of my life have fail to give information to our government about act of terrorism from their side of the country can he tell we what inquest will actually go ahead now if he could name they all would really appreciate that will write to the hon gentleman in response to his last question if may what the hon member describe be exactly what the commission be there to do be make number of change in the commission to create great confidence on the part of family to come forward have great respect for sir declan morgan and his colleague and for the work that they be do the fact that hundred family have approach they be very significant but as the hon gentleman will know very well there be many family in northern ireland who will say because of the circumstance of its creation and the closing down of inquest and civil case we do not trust the commission to look independently and properly at our case be try to make it possible for more family to come forward so that more can find the answer they seek the hon gentleman make powerful point about co operation from ireland the reason why be so keen to try to reach an agreement with the irish government be that we have get as result of our negotiation commitment to co operate with the commission at the moment the irish government will not do so because of the legislation pass by the last government once we have make these change they be commit to co operate in the end we will all be judge on how this go and how it proceed and whether the answer be find for family but we will be in much well position than we be with the total mess that the last government leave we when we cut through the waffle of this statement and the secretary of state answer this afternoon one fact remain soldier who serve in northern ireland who have already have case try will be able to be drag back into the court and will be subject to interrogation there the secretary of state talk about all these wonderful protection so let we look at they they will not have to travel to northern ireland they can appear remotely they will be give help to appear remotely assume that mean that somebody will show they how to work an ipad and they will not have knock at the door from anybody other than the military police so the psni will not be come over from northern ireland and knock at their door at in the morning that be hardly any reassurance to the people who serve in northern ireland then we be tell that deal with the family who be affect by the trouble be joint responsibility with irish government there be no obligation in this statement on the irish government other than to throw piece of silver at the legacy mechanism to assuage their guilt for protect terrorist over year and for cover up for the collaboration of some within the irish establishment who help the ira in their job would say two thing to right hon gentleman first would not be quite so light with the importance of that commitment to allow our veteran to give evidence remotely the minister for the armed forces and have both speak to veteran for whom have to go back to northern ireland would bring back memory that they have be have to deal with ever since they serve that be actually very important protection and one that the government be commit to put in place secondly how would the right hon gentleman propose that we move this question forward for all the criticism no doubt will receive many many more the people most wish to hear from be those who have practical proposal as to how we can create great confidence on the part of the victim survivor and the family so that they get the answer they be look for anyone who come forward with helpful suggestion will find ready partner in point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker as you know when we have budget the chancellor of the exchequer deliver the budget and then the red book with all the fine detail the number and the graph be immediately make available to mps so that they can at least glance through it and ask the chancellor question conversely this afternoon we just have spend nearly an hour and half debate statement about bill and very important remedial order that we be quite deliberately not allow to see surely it would have be well if hon member have be allow to receive the bill and the remedial order at least to glance at it for few minute so they could have ask much well inform question of the secretary of state unfortunately the secretary of state have organise this cynically to prevent that madam deputy speaker how do we prevent that from happen again thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order but as be usual practice when the bill be present it will be available in the vote office on point of order madam deputy speaker over the summer be the subject of two online death threat which the police be investigate these be post in response to video publish by the hon member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore the video accuse of not tell the truth on very sensitive subject the horrific abuse of child by groom gang if the hon member have make those remark in parliament they would have be deem unparliamentary as well as the death threat that video elicit torrent of misogynistic racist and offensive comment which remain online as member of this house it be incumbent on we to do all we can to prevent the escalation of abuse the action of the hon member for keighley and ilkley be at good irresponsible and at bad inflammatory call on he to apologise to withdraw the video and to commit to refrain from personal attack against and other elect official in future online abuse have psychological impact on all of we who be subject to it on our staff our family and our friend it have chilling effect on democracy stifle debate put good people off stand for election and create climate of hate therefore also hope that the committee on standards will review the code of conduct to ensure that the same standard expect of member in this place be uphold in their word and behaviour outside this place particularly online thank the hon member for give notice of her point of order and be aware that she have notify the hon member for keighley and ilkley in advance of raise this matter in the chamber although it be not strictly point of order for the chair mr speaker take the security and safety of member very seriously and would

connected purpose extend my thank to the clerks and the team in the public bill office for their invaluable and diligent assistance and to the minister my hon friend the member for dover and deal mike tapp for his support and for be in the chamber today there be an old saying in cymraeg in welsh tegell yn berwi barod it mean the kettle be boil and be ready the kettle have be on the boil for long time in wales and welsh people have be ready for decade to ensure they receive birth marriage and death certificate in the welsh language this bill aim to give welsh people after registration the right to receive such certificate in welsh only english only or bilingually it be not the first bill on this subject to come before this house or the other place politician from both welsh labour and plaid cymru have present bills on this matter the late dafydd elis thomas present bill in the house of lords as far back as as proud clwyd boy be pleased to say that next be bill by the then clwyd west mp gareth thomas who present the first bill in the commons in he be follow by hywel williams who present another bill to the commons while welsh labour and plaid cymru have lead on this subject there have also be notable support from politician of other party include lembit öpik for the liberal democrats and michael fabricant for the conservatives the cheeky boy of the noughtie this exceptionally broad support across the political spectrum show that this be not party political subject nor should something as important and treasure as the welsh language ever be party political on that note acknowledge the work of the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts who have share many discussion with on this issue and look forward to continue to work with she people who have live in wales may well have receive their child birth certificate or parent death certificate in both english and welsh and be think what be the problem what be the purpose of this bill sadly there be many circumstance where people might not receive welsh or bilingual certificate and instead receive an english only one there be no rule or law that say if someone live in wales or be welsh and live in england they can or must receive such certificate in welsh or bilingually that be what happen to constituent of mine afryl davies be delighted that afryl be in the gallery today and pay tribute to she and her family for their fortitude in the light of the tragedy they face sadly afryl husband aled pass away aled be proud welshman and proud welsh speaker but his family do not receive copy of his death certificate bilingually they receive only an english language version they write many letter include to the coroner the registrar and the general register office request that his death certificate be reissue bilingually but sadly they be turn down at every opportunity because of how the law currently operate worse still my constituent be tell that their only option be to turn to the court to attempt to secure reissued certificate in welsh afryl come to one of my regular advice surgery to see if could help and have get to admit that be dumbfound that this situation be somehow still possible in the welsh language act and the welsh language wales measure be put in place to ensure that the welsh language have parity and equal legal status with english and must not be treat less favourably yet here we be with proud welsh person who live and sadly die in our capital city and his family be as yet unable to receive his death certificate bilingually think we can all agree that people live in wales and welsh people live in england should be able to receive their birth death and marriage certificate in cymraeg in welsh or in english or bilingually if they so choose the previous labour government agree with that and be in the process of make that law that start in when there be uk government white paper and consultation exercise on the future of civil registration the birth marriage and death registration in the century white paper state the government will extend the facility for bilingual english welsh birth registration to include event occur in england to welsh speak parent presently only birth that occur in wales can be register bi lingually in english and welsh this can cause problem for example if welsh mother give birth in hospital over the border in england and can not then obtain birth registration in bi lingual format after the registration it will be possible for document to be issue in welsh only english only or both language in line with birth registration the government will extend the facility to register death in english and welsh to include death which take place in england after the registration it will be possible for document to be issue in welsh only english only or both language follow the subsequent consultation period the general register office be instruct by the then uk labour government to start look into plan to make that provision possible in the then wales office minister wayne david state that the government remain firmly committed to produce welsh language certificate and the general register office be explore the good way to do that official report march vol unfortunately the uk labour government of the day be not able to get that through the house of commons before the general election and the succeed conservative and liberal democrat government would go on to abandon the plan despite support from some of their own mp as have already mention my constituent be tell that they could

the government and all other to consider how to improve mental health waiting time and indeed the reporting of they new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for thurrock address some of those challenge by request that the secretary of state report on the adequacy of community service for people with autism and learning disability she be absolutely right to highlight that and it be the same for all patient subject to the mental health act lack of resource in community service also have an impact on the implementation of community treatment order and have the opportunity to review then adequately be key to their not feel like an ongoing sentence as the charity mind have highlight new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for sheffield central be to be commend in that it would ensure that community treatment order be sufficiently and robustly review when speak to senior nhs mental health leader recently he tell that through community service the nhs already know nearly everyone who get into mental health crisis or end up get section and detain in mental health in patient bed improve mental health community service be key to improve the mental health of the nation as be ensure that resource for mental health be use appropriately the clinically lead review of mental health standard in under the last government recommend four week access standard for mental health service yet the current average wait be more like six week as this legislation be operationalise would like to see work on how to bring down those wait would the minister reflect on that in his speech nhs england recently introduce six pilot for the transformation of community mental health service some of that work be be deliver by my local mental health trust the cumbria northumberland tyne and wear nhs foundation trust and think it show promise as we consider these amendment to the bill would be interested to see how the learning from those pilot can be take forward to far improve community mental health service similarly community service call mental health together have be introduce in my area do my hon friend agree that the whole mental health system be so complex with different practice in different part of the country and that not have continuity and standard across the country be big issue for mental health my hon friend be absolutely right and thank he for his intervention part of the issue around poorly report waiting time be that it be less easy to see that differential access than it would perhaps be in physical health service indeed over the year when specialist team have be set up for example the early intervention and psychosis team and assertive outreach team which know my hon friend know well give his professional background they have be introduce with very good intention and to target specific need but they sometimes make it more difficult for patient to get overall care rather than very specialist care for individual condition will not take any more time madam deputy speaker but will just say that the mantra of investment and reform apply to mental health service as it should apply to all our health service for we to make further progress in pursue parity of esteem between mental health and physical health we not only need to consider these amendment today and pass the bill to modernise the legislation but ensure the government have sufficient political priority on produce and improve mental health service rise member will have notice that many people be stand to speak and there be not significant amount of time for the debate so with the exception of front bench contribution there will be an immediate four minute time limit call the shadow minister when we last debate the bill on second reading say that protect someone freedom for their own safety be not licence to own their life but duty to help they find it again that principle still guide we today because good intention alone do not mend troubled system compassion without competence be not care it be sentiment without substance on second reading speak of bridge and rough road and of how resilience and recovery depend on the strength of the structure that carry people through their hard time tonight we return to that bridge the question before we be not whether we believe in reform after all there be cross party agreement on that but whether the government have build the foundation to make it stand warm word be plentiful but the reality be that too many people be still fall through the gap detention be still present community service be stretch and family be leave navigate maze of bureaucracy while wait for help that may never come we all know that reform can not be deliver on aspiration alone it require delivery plan workforce and system capable of learn from its own mistake we know the chapter on delivery be miss from the year nhs plan and there be further risk tonight that we miss another opportunity after all the principle in the bill be the right one they be even on the face of the bill choice and autonomy least restriction therapeutic benefit and treat the person as an individual but those principle need power behind they and that power lie in delivery this report stage be our chance to turn those word into commitment new clause require the government to publish fully cost delivery plan within month of the act pass into law set out how integrate care board and local authority will deliver adequate community service crucially the plan must be develop through consultation with those who know well that be vital because although we support the many aim of the bill the government already have pretty dismal record of announce reform without any credible plan to deliver they let we take the ongoing nhs reorganisation in march ministers make surprise announcement of the abolition of nhs england and its absorption into the department of health and social care yet six month on they can not say what it will cost how many staff will be lose or how it will be pay for the health service journal report grow confusion inside the system and warning from nhs leader that the lack of clarity risk paralyse decision making write question to the government simply receive the answer some upfront cost in the million yet independent estimate say the cost be over billion even the chief executive sir jim mackey point out that the treasury must agree fund for integrate care board redundancy within week or the nhs will have to turn to plan the same chaos be play out across integrate care board with local leader warn that there be already destabilisation due to the reduction if ministers can not manage their own top down reorganisation why should anyone believe they can deliver more ambitious overhaul of mental health service without clear cost plan especially when waiting list have rise in the last three consecutive month this labour government have already cut the proportion of spending on mental health as dr lade smith cbe the president of the royal college of psychiatrists say at the time it be illogical that the share of nhs funding for mental health service be be reduce at time of soar need and significant staff shortage go on she say that the proportion of nhs funding allocate to mental health service will decrease which will equate to these vital service miss out on an estimate million or more that they would have receive if their share have be maintain it be decrease in the proportion of the mental health investment standard for the first time in believe nine year it be incredibly concerning it be hard won cross party support that make that proportion go up over time it be incremental but it be start to make difference to the system do the hon gentleman agree that it would be helpful if the government clarify whether that will continue in when baroness merron come to our committee she could not confirm that if there be not go to be continuation the system need to know by now frankly so that it can prepare adequately for it the chair of the health and social care committee be absolutely right simple answer from the minister today on report would go long way to alleviate those fear from the mental health sector look forward to his response on that amendment would add simple but important requirement that each care and treatment plan must include an assessment of the level of risk to public safety pose by the patient in the community the purpose of the bill be right the government want to make the system more compassionate therapeutic patient centre and modernise and we strongly agree with that ambition however modernisation must go hand in hand with public confidence and the public and patient themselves must know that every plan for treatment and discharge be root not only in care but in safety in committee argue that the framework still omit one dimension which be public safety as far as can see there be still no explicit requirement in the bill for clinician to assess and record the level of risk pose to the public my hon friend be make an excellent point constituent have come to about patient with schizophrenia for example who have be release before their psychosis have fully pass with one such instance tragically end in the death of another resident all of these situation could have be prevent if the patient have be keep safely in bed until they be at proper level of medication and the psychosis have pass do the shadow minister agree that that be something we need to take forward in this bill it be win win for all party thank my hon friend for raise that tragic case those be the kind of case that this amendment seek to deal with we have only to look at the tragic case of nicola edgington and valdo calocane to see how escalating risk happen with huge consequence for the family patient and victim when raise this matter in committee the minister give very thoughtful answer he say that if any risk at all to public safety be perceive that must be document it be basic expectation of the professional management of particular patient that any risk identify to public safety and protection must be in there welcome that with amendment be simply ask if that be indeed the government position why not make it clear in the bill the minister concede in committee that take the hon gentleman point on whether or not it should be in the bill will come back to he on that because would be rather surprised if it be not make very clear somewhere that that be basic expectation if it be not that would obviously need to be look at but be reasonably confident that it be official report mental health public bill committee june unfortunately expect in practice be not the same as require in law we know from past review that there be gap in the risk assessment and that communication can be too inconsistent put such requirement in statute would not be bureaucracy it would simply clarify that the minister may argue that it already exist in professional code in the mental health act code of practice or even in risk management framework but the statutory duty do not our amendment would put that duty squarely in the bill talk of safety will turn to new clause which would ensure that no child be place on an adult mental health ward except in truly exceptional circumstance and only when it be demonstrably in their good interest the government argue that guidance already cover that but this guidance have no tooth it can be ignore or inconsistently apply again guidance without legal backing be too easily ignore that be why the joint committee on human rights argue in its letter that this part of the bill need strengthen the minister also say that place these safeguard in legislation would remove flexibility for clinician in emergency but new clause do allow for exceptional circumstance it simply require that they be justified record and subject to oversight research from university college london find that there have be increase in the number of child and young people admit to adult ward for mental health disorder and this increase be sharp among teenage girl with eat disorder they be the most vulnerable and they be the one who bear the brunt of this that be another reason why be shocked that the mental health budget be decrease be see an increase across my constituency and be sure it be the same in many other of girl in secondary school present with severe mental health issue suicidal tendency and eat disorder and they be desperately cry out for additional mental health support my hon friend be absolutely right that that support need to be there fortunately it be not the budget that be reduce but the proportion of funding and it show the priority of this government when it come to mental health be concerned that without new clause child may be harm or traumatise and place in an adult ward without proper justification and it will be little comfort for the family to hear that guidance be breach amendment stand up for the simple but vital principle that when child be detain under the mental health act the person legally recognise to act for they their nominated person should hold parental responsibility only where there be legitimate safeguarding concern should that be set aside at first glance this may seem technical but it speak to something profound about how the law view childhood family and the balance between protection and autonomy the government be right to use the bill to modernise the old near relative system which be too rigid too bind by bloodline and at time blind to the complexity of family life under the bill however child under deem competent could nominate any adult that could be year old boyfriend or peer or someone exercise control and once nominate that person get full control it be legal authority we need to ensure that protection be there for the person if there be breakdown on the family side interruption see that madam deputy speaker be encourage to wind up so will solidify my comment into more erudite approach the point be that in law this principle be already clear in the children act which define it as the foundation stone of what family should look like with this amendment believe we have solve the concern the minister have at committee stage about the state of family in the modern era in any other walk of life the legal framework exist so why would we weaken it when it come to mental health we discuss the issue with and the grey area there in committee and be grateful to the minister for meet beforehand to discuss they know that he take on my comment about solve the practicality and hope he will look at they seriously for this house there be no great moral burden than decide for someone who can not decide for themselves where care end and where control begin that be exactly what the house be address with this bill how to protect without diminish how to act with compassion without surrender precision and how to empower without impose involuntary care must never be the reflex of system be it under pressure or out of principle the house agree on this position the challenge be delivery compassion demand more than good intention it demand delivery discipline and detail with this bill the opposition lay the challenge of delivery it must be not just pledge but plan the public will judge we all not just on how kindly this house speak but on how faithfully it serve those who depend on we most will speak to new clause and and amendment which table not just as an mp but as father after what my family have be through believe that any parent would do the same yesterday alongside the right hon member for salisbury john glen have the privilege of hear dr kate szymankiewicz speak about her daughter ruth she share not only the tragic circumstance of ruth death but the type of person ruth be her dream of become vet her kindness and how friend describe she as character straight out of an enid blyton novel that be the ruth her family remember and cherish as parent we become part of world we never want to know be privileged to have meet kate but we agree that we wish our path have never cross because of what that mean ruth be admit to an in patient facility for treatment of an eat disorder but instead of receive the care she need her family be shut out and allow only two two hour visit per week they spend more time travel than they do with their daughter ruth be just year old when she fatally self harm just five month into her stay three month from that date my family be face with the same hospital huntercombe as the only choice of bed for our daughter at that same hospital when child ask if they could have an extra type of jam for breakfast in the morning they be tell it do not have the budget and when ask why minstrels be no long part of snack time they be tell that they be eat too many that be the problem with nhs fund private provision even at night the operator plead poverty my wife and have two vivid memory of our young being prise from we without any warning we think that be normal six month of nasogastric tube feeding we think that be normal illegal restraint so bad that it cause post traumatic stress disorder we think that be normal forget to feed our daughter time we start to realise that that be normal but not acceptable instead of wish to improve its practice the hospital have accuse of make this up if child be face any other physical illness such as cancer or even something more short term that require hospital stay parental visit and involvement be quite rightly see as means of enhance care genuinely struggle to understand why our clinical consensus around mental health continue to support model where already vulnerable child be isolate from their parent the very people who know and love they most child on these ward be treat as wilful they be not they be child and without empathy or sympathy many consultant we encounter opt not to apply the national institute for health and care excellence guideline staff be poorly train and in fear of psychiatrist who rule the roost and prevent people from speak up the private equity firm be focus not on long term treatment but just on turn mental health into money my amendment do not seek to undermine the bill strength nor the important work undertake by the department in fact the cross party support have receive include from the right hon member for salisbury reflect how uncontroversial they be the minister and have have robust and constructive discussion on the matter but ask he to confirm that he will do everything in his power to ensure the following parent must not be shut out of their child care as evidence show that regular parental contact enhance care outcome the placement of child on adult mental health ward under the mental health act must be limit strictly to exceptional circumstance and practitioner must be actively compel where appropriate to involve themselves in the development and delivery of child care and treatment plan we have duty to ensure that the tragic circumstance surround ruth death be never repeat the government be elect with phenomenal majority win place we never think possible include my own constituency of isle of wight west on platform of meaningful change if we do not use this moment to do the right thing and acknowledge that child in mental health service need their parent more often than not fear that we may never get another chance call the liberal democrat spokesperson begin by thank colleague across the house who have work so constructively on this long await bill there have be shared recognition that the current mental health system be fail too many people and that reform be urgently need thank the minister for engage with we so constructively throughout the process include as recently as yesterday it be much appreciated when speak to people in winchester know that hon member have very similar story mental health be one of the issue that come up the most we have family wait month or even year for treatment we have parent watch their child deteriorate and we have people languish on waiting list when they would rather be work or study the bill represent the big reform of mental health care in over year it strengthen patient autonomy modernise detention procedure and rightly remove police station from the definition of place of safety these be vital and much need step forward and know that member on all side welcome they will speak briefly to several new clause table in my name each aim at strengthen the bill impact for some of the most vulnerable people it seek to protect new clause would ensure that every hospital have dedicated liaison service for the carer of patient detain under the mental health act this be vital step to support carer during what can be an unimaginably difficult time and to close blind spot that too often exist when someone be care for love one with serious mental illness we know that parental mental health concern be now the most common factor in child social care assessment and that those child be at much high risk of develop mental ill health themselves yet only about third of mental health professional in in patient setting ask whether patient be parent these child and the carer who support they be too often invisible by identify and support carer properly new clause would help close those gap and ensure that no family have to struggle in silence we do not discuss this specifically in committee but would be interested to know about the interaction between the independent mental health advocate which be be expand and which we all agree with in committee and new liaison service worry about the duplication will the hon member explain how that crossover would work in practice that be prescient point at the moment there be no responsibility to ensure that child in particular and other carer too be identify even if they be put in advance choice document if the person make those decision do not identify they that will not come about we would have to be careful that there be not unnecessary duplication however the initiative the hon gentleman put forward be not belt and brace approach to identify young carer and other carer who be struggle new clause seek to end the detention of child on adult ward require the number to be reduce to zero within five year other member have discuss that today and the secretary of state to set out how that will be achieve it simply can not be right that child be still be treat on adult ward it be unacceptable and can seriously hinder recovery and effective care although the bill rightly focus on hospital base treatment the process have also lay bare how fragile our wide mental health service have become with the lack of early support in primary and community care and the shortage of initiative that help people long before they reach crisis point that be why new clause would place duty on integrate care board to ensure that community service have the resource they need to meet the demand and report on that regularly keep people well in their community must be at the heart of any modern mental health strategy because if we get the community care right we prevent crisis reduce pressure on hospital and help people live healthy more independent life finally new clause would establish veteran mental health oversight officer that dedicated role would ensure that those who have serve our country receive the understanding and tailor care they deserve when they come into contact with mental health service too often veteran experience mental ill health sometimes link to their service and they find themselves in system that do not fully recognise their unique experience the proposal would help change that by provide proper oversight encourage join up work across the nhs veteran service and the third sector and ensure that compassion and accountability sit at the heart of how the mental health act be apply to veteran take together the proposal be about make our mental health system even more humane more join up and more focus on prevention and recovery hope the government will take they in the spirit in which they be intend which be to strengthen this important bill which we very much support and deliver system that truly support those who need it most will speak on new clause which set out the condition under which community treatment order can be extend beyond month like many across my constituency of sheffield central know personally how overstretch our mental health service be my brother live with complex mental health need and our family have see at first hand the impact of churn workforce long waiting list and lack of community support service bring about by an unrelenting crisis in funding our system have not be properly expand or adapt to meet the challenge instead far too many people be detain and restrict rather than support to recover we see this nowhere more acutely than in the overuse of community treatment order which be suppose to be bridge from hospital to home for those who be constantly readmitte to hospital people have describe they as tag that nobody can see but you know it around your mind the evidence show that they have not meet their intended purpose with three major study have find no reduction in readmission or hospital time through their use yet despite the previous government have promise reform community treatment order have continue reform have be too slow and too narrow in scope in sheffield we be proud to be one of six national pilot area for the neighbourhood mental health centre scheme provide round the clock access to local join up care but if these ambition be to work they must be match by real investment not only in our hospital and clinical team but in the voluntary and community sector that so often hold the system together the community organisation peer support group faith network youth worker and cultural centre be the glue that keep people well between their appointment they offer culturally competent person centre care reach those whom statutory service often miss and rebuild trust where the system have fail yet too many of these group be stretch to breaking point expect to do more with less to fill the gap leave by underfunded public service all that be why my new clause would reintroduce month standard for community treatment order it would require formal review after year involve the patient their nominated person and second doctor it would ensure transparency scrutiny and crucially patient voice in the process welcome minister assurance that code of practice can provide these safeguard but guidance can only reflect the law it can not replace it that must be what we do in this house if we want people to trust mental health service we must write into legislation the expectation of good quality tailored and reliable service if we want people to have enforceable right those right must be write into legislation and if we want evidence base healthcare we must be bold enough to follow up when the evidence do not demonstrate policy benefit and reflect that in legislation rise to support new clause and first pay tribute to the hon member for isle of wight west mr quigley who mention my constituent and the tragic case of the loss of their daughter ruth my experience of listen to her story have make support the new clause want to finish my remark with what kate ask to say in this house kate szymankiewicz be gp in salisbury and her husband be surgeon their daughter ruth take her own life age she be unlawfully kill while in child mental health facility that be what actually happen that be what be expose in the court case this summer what happen to ruth be tragedy the system do not work as it be suppose to work be anxious today that the minister should not rely on the advice and understanding of official or on the guidance that be in place ask that he be really assure in his own mind that the legislation he be go to take forward will mean that this will not happen again will not go into the whole story but essentially ruth be place in facility that be two hour drive from her home she be not technically place out of area but the family would spend more time drive to see she than they would be allow to actually spend with she these be wonderful love parent who do everything they could everything in their power to support their daughter through condition that she could and should have recover from but because she be sectioned under the mental health act to allow she to be force fed her parent technically lose many of their right to involvement in their daughter care they have wonderful love relationship with their daughter she be happy child who be determined to get well and her family be keen to see that that happen she be section only to allow she to be feed but the knock on consequence be that the dynamic between the parent and their daughter who be patient change as adult protocol be put in place when kate visit parliament yesterday ask she what would you like to say on your behalf and she say this if your child be unwell and must go into hospital whether that be because of physical illness such as cancer or mental health illness like an eat disorder they need to know that their mum or dad or caregiver can be there with they whenever they need to help they through scary and vulnerable time child can not be treat in isolation they need the support of those who love and know they well their family family need to be at the heart of our health system in order for child to heal and for their family to heal with they when the next child be in crisis which be right now ask you all not to turn away but to grasp this opportunity to make the mental health act champion for their wellbeing please include all these amendment to safeguard this generation of young people the bill address fundamental flaw in our current mental health legislation in relation to the right of people with learn disability and autistic people will focus my comment on new clause and which have table they be also about vital right within our mental health legislation and relate closely to the powerful comment make by the right hon member for salisbury john glen and by my hon friend the member for isle of wight west mr quigley new clause would provide for mandatory independent care education and treatment review for patient detain in long term segregation in her report my heart break baroness hollins highlight the harm and suffering that be so often associate with long term segregation and assess how introduce care education and treatment review can reduce the incidence and use of segregation very much welcome the provision on review of care and treatment that ministers have already include in the bill but it have now be demonstrate that independently chair review be make real difference and lead to inappropriate long term segregation be challenge and address the human impact be substantial new clause would make such review requirement when someone have be place in segregation for hour new clause seek to introduce new level of scrutiny in case where patient with autism or learning disability have be detain for more than five year believe there be very strong case for an additional check and balance when people have be under detention and compulsory measure for so many year understand that the late datum for england show that people with learn disability or autism who be currently in in patient unit have be detain there for more than year in previous role provide advocacy for the family of young man kyle who have learn disability he be patient in the state hospital in carstairs in scotland but his family live in the north east of scotland his mother and grandmother have to make round trip of nearly seven hour to see kyle for visit which have in the past be restrict to single hour kyle be convict of no crime when he be admit to carstairs in he have be there for year the toll that this have take on his family have be horrendous the situation be devastating for they and there be no end in sight although it be case for the scottish mental health system it have provide with an insight into what many people with learn disability and their family will be experience in england today and the limitation of mental health tribunal in deal with these issue people with learn disability have be lose their liberty for year because of their disability this be human right emergency it be clear that we have to do far more to prevent these situation from happen the bill will help to do that with its welcome measure on prevention but where these case be happen now believe there should be an additional level of scrutiny an extra check and balance so that after so long someone with the right level of authority and expertise can challenge provider to do well and to ask the question how can it be that someone have lose their liberty and their right to family life because we can not make their care and treatment work in community set although very much welcome the introduction of the care education and treatment review believe we should go far in these circumstance that be why new clause would make provision for notification to the care quality commission when someone have be detain for more than five year this be an excellent bill it will do so much for the right of people with learn disability and autism but there be several area where hope the minister can outline what far ambition the government have to ensure that our mental health system be fit for purpose and base on human right to squeeze in few more back benchers the speak limit be now three minute this be long overdue and very welcome bill but frankly it will not even touch the side of what most of our constituent and community need when it come to the wide mental health landscape support many of the amendment to improve it not least those lay by my hon friend on the liberal democrat benches need to make couple of quick point because we want the bill to succeed the minister will know that since december the health and social care committee have be conduct an inquiry into community mental health service because we recognise that unless we start tackle these matter upstream we will not achieve the bill aim for so many it feel like they be walk through an nhs desert they simply can not get the appointment they need they do not feel support and no one can navigate this complex system just few week ago while still on maternity leave decide to have keeping in touch day and the committee decide to visit an oasis in this desert the incredible barnsley street neighbourhood mental health centre in tower hamlets unfortunately the centre be one of only six pilot set up to this level across the country but we hear some amazing story of how people have be divert away from in patient mental health unit by an approach that truly put the patient at its centre it be inspiring however we hear from the centre that its funding will not continue beyond april it be only just start to gather the datum it need system change be desperately need in this space but the concern be that the system will change without robust datum behind it my question to the minister be will the centre be fund beyond april if not how can the department make decision about the system base on datum that do not represent full calendar year also want to speak in support of amendment pay tribute to cyril and dianne whose son leon suffer from schizophrenia for many year and sadly complete suicide in january he be let down by community mental health service leon mother dianne see the illness get bad and bad and when she try to re refer he into the system after he have be detain she be tell computer say no this bill will improve the life of family like dianne and leon because dianne plea would have be hear under the new nominate person provision amendment would be an extra step ensure that the plan be share with parent and carer with the nominate person pay tribute to those who have campaign so doggedly for the inclusion of nominated person in the bill be no expert on mental health law but do have decade of experience in the health and care sector and my sister be psychiatrist know that the decision to detain someone with severe mental illness be never take lightly and that psychiatrist must weigh up range of factor and information to come to final decision table amendment and and new clause after number of conversation with the royal college of psychiatrists which have express concern about the wording use in the detention criterion take together the purpose of my amendment be to ensure that the detention criterion be align with good clinical practice it be important that they be reflect in the primary legislation rather than simply rely on code of practice they would remove from the detention criterion mention of the term likelihood or may be cause to allow psychiatrist to make straightforward holistic assessment of individual risk in the context of significant mental disorder the risk be that likelihood suggest that it be possible for clinician to predict serious harm such as violence or suicide when it be not possible to do so while the idea of causation neglect the fact that complex background condition can be the genesis of harm there be risk too that the language may lead to preventive detention more detention not less it be always easy with hindsight when unexpected harm have happen to oversimplify causation and ask why be this person not detain it be critical that those task with interpret detention criterion feel comfortable with what they be interpret believe that the bill in its current form risk inadvertently lead to defensive practice which as we know be not usually good quality care hope that the minister will explain how he will ensure that the detention criterion as draft will not lead to those unintended consequence of course welcome the fact that the bill put into practice the principle of the wessely review and in particular the aim of reduce detention in favour of support more people in the community however there will always be instance in which people do need to be detain in an in patient setting so investment in those facility be vital be delighted that lynfield mount hospital in my constituency have recently secure funding to implement fantastic plan to upgrade its in patient facility which will help to ensure that people be treat close to home get support to recover maintain relationship with family friend and colleague and restart their life after detention commend the amendment to the minister as member of the bill committee have the opportunity to closely examine the development and scrutiny of this bill alongside my opposition colleague we seek to strengthen the legislation particularly in relation to safeguard child and ensure robust protection for those admit under the mental health act framework give the shortness of time will speak only about amendment and they make the vital clarification that the nominated person for any patient under the age of must have parental or guardian responsibility unless there be clear and establish safeguard concern in essence that would ensure that the parent remain the lawful decision maker and the first and most natural safeguard for their child welfare let we consider for moment what be at stake imagine vulnerable year old girl frighten and confuse during psychiatric admission in that moment of distress well mean adult or bad someone with hide agenda could persuade the child to nominate they as their representative that individual would then gain legal power to object to treatment or discharge decision while the parent the very people who know the child well and have both moral and legal duty to protect they could be sideline once such nomination be witness it carry legal force the right and responsibility of parent could in effect be overridden although that may sound hypothetical it be not family court have see precisely how manipulative individual exploit vulnerable young people groomer trafficker and abuser thrive in the legal grey zone if we be not crystal clear that only court may displace parental responsibility we risk leave the door ajar for such exploitation ask the minister to assure the house in wind up that no child under will be permit to override parental authority simply by nominate someone else without full and proper judicial process the bill do have fallback provision which be of course welcome but they be not watertight unless the law explicitly confirm that only court can transfer or restrict parental right my hon friend make an excellent point the only protection that can see in schedule be an age requirement stipulation not to be disqualify by previous court order and the presence of witness there be therefore no pre emptive way of protect people which be why amendment be so important my hon friend be absolutely right both he and make those point in committee be surprised that the minister do not see the risk here the safeguard that my hon friend talk about must be beyond any doubt the amendment in his name provide exactly that clarity it would prevent unrelated or loosely connected individual from step into role that rightfully belong to those with both legal duty and an emotional bond the parent or guardian and it would preserve the fundamental principle that parent should not find their role diminish by accident or administrative oversight as be say this be not an abstract risk it be very real and foreseeable consequence of the unclear drafting these amendment do not weaken the right of patient they strengthen the protection around they they ensure that in modernise this law quite rightly we do not inadvertently undermine the old and most important protection of all parent duty to safeguard their child we must ensure that the state can only curtail that right under the strict judicial scrutiny with evidence test and the child welfare paramount in do so we will make this legislation not only legally sound but in my view morally right new clause table by my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans would require local authority and icb to supply fully cost plan to ensure they be able to provide adequate community service for people with learn disability and autistic people support that entirely as vice chairman of the all party parliamentary group for special educational need and disability and from speak to group in my constituency such as last wednesday and growing hope know that the process around send be complicated and not fit for purpose fortunately we have chance to help it slightly with this bill so ask the minister to support new clause would like to speak in support of new clause table by my hon friend the member for thurrock jen craft on second reading warmly welcome the change that this legislation will introduce regard autistic people or those who have learn disability as result it will no long be possible for someone to be detain in mental health hospital indefinitely simply because they have autism or learn disability in the current system autistic people and those with learn disability have experience inappropriate care over medication and extended period of detention because of lack of facility in the nhs and social care so this change be welcome and long overdue the government have confirm that the change will be implement once the necessary community provision be in place establish strong support in the community be essential for not only enable safe discharge from hospital setting but prevent unnecessary admission in the first place recognise that the government be work on set out what strong community service look like and what resource they require to implement they from serve with the minister in committee have no doubt about his commitment to ensure that this community provision be introduce in timely manner but support the proposal of my hon friend the member for thurrock that there should be road map in the legislation that will provide clear framework outline how those service will be introduce after all end inappropriate detention require robust community base alternative to ensure that people with autism or learn disability who would have previously be detain do not fall through gap in the system have road map develop in conjunction with autistic people people with learn disability their carer and healthcare professional will help to identify and address any gap in service provision and workforce capacity also believe that it will help to reduce the risk of people with autism or learn disability need police intervention or emergency hospital care because the support be inadequate by put in place road map new clause would help to ensure that we end all the soon the injustice of people with autism or learn disability be detain will speak to amendment to and to in my name which address gap in crisis provision and accountability for autistic people and people with learn disability on second reading tell this house about declan morrison my constituent who die aged just after spend day in section suite that be wholly inappropriate for his complex need remind the house that section suite be design for hour stay or maximum of hour in extreme case the coroner who investigate declan death find that there be risk that future death could occur unless action be take the timeline of what happen in the run up to declan death show cascade of systemic failure declan family graeme sam and kaitlyn have ask to ensure that parliament learn from what happen these amendment in my name reflect those lesson and the coroner recommendation in committee the minister make several point about early version of these amendment which have try to address in these revise version in particular on crisis accommodation the minister argue that exist duty on icb already cover crisis provision and that the amendment be too prescriptive potentially restrict icb in design provision emphasise the importance of flexibility for icb to meet local need understand the desire not to be overly prescriptive but in declan case over place be contact and no suitable accommodation could be find anywhere in the country flexibility fail declan the revised version of the amendment allow for regional solution beyond the icb but suspect that the minister will still find it too prescriptive however the fundamental question remain should there not be duty to ensure that provision exist somewhere the cambridgeshire and peterborough icb establish crisis service after declan death that operate at capacity demonstrate both need and viability but it close when funding be withdraw highlight the challenge with voluntary provision on funding the devon partnership nhs trust look after people with mental health challenge in the torbay community where level of depth of despair be particularly high the trust be face million cut so do my hon friend agree that change will be irrelevant if we do not have adequate funding agree that resource need to be put in place to support the many good measure in the bill and in many of the propose amendment in declan case service be create in the wake of tragedy and funding be find but too often such service disappear when attention move elsewhere recognise that the implementation challenge be real and appreciate that the minister have commit to provide annual write statement on progress but believe the principle in the amendment around crisis provision proactive intervention accountability and co production with autistic people merit consideration as much as would like he to do not expect that the minister will have late change of heart on the amendment today however hope he will be willing to meet after the bill receive royal assent to discuss how we can work together to ensure the systemic failure that lead to declan death be properly address during implementation of the measure in the bill in stop those systemic failure we would honour the memory of declan in the interest of time will turn straight to new clause table in my name the bill set out range of situation where the competence of patient age under will be relevant but it do not set out framework for how it should be determine that put patient under year old at huge disadvantage unlike those age and over there be no clear mechanism for determine whether child under can make decision and the law assume that can not make decision for themselves unless they demonstrate they be able to do so that mean that may not benefit fully from the right and safeguard set out in the bill because they be assume to lack competence to make the relevant decision for example they may not be able to exercise their right to choose nominated person or to access enhanced safeguard around treatment there be currently no statutory test for determine child ability to make decision while some may refer to gillick competence the joint committee on the draft mental health bill note that gillick competence be broad ambiguous and that there be significant inconsistency in its application similar observation be make by the court of appeal in decision early this year which also indicate the court approval of functional test to determine child competence new clause address this disparity by introduce functional test to determine an ability to decide this reflect the suggest approach in the current code of practice adopt by some judge the law commission have recommend similar test as part of its propose legal reform concern disabled child social care this test fill significant gap in the bill provide important clarity for professional when child competence need to be determine crucially the test set out in new clause be explicitly limit to decision make under the reform mental health act it do not cover decision fall outside of the act so do not affect the exist decision make power of the court or those with parental responsibility clear and consistent approach to assess child competence can only be achieve by include test on the face of the bill as the code of practice can only reflect the law it can not prescribe test for competence would be grateful if the minister address that point at the end of this debate and if he would consider meet to discuss my amendment in more detail this bill have many strength that will deliver for people and modernise mental health care and it be crucial that we ensure child and young people can benefit from those strength in the same way adult can benefit this bill give we real opportunity to modernise mental health care and make sure that patient choice and fairness be at the heart of mental health service but to achieve that we must first confront the deep inequality that still shape people experience of mental health care particularly among ethnic minority community those face economic hardship and young people like so many issue the intersectionality between those factor mean that some group face particular challenge in navigating and access the help they need in dewsbury and batley we see the human reality of that inequality rate of depression stand at high than the national average and schizophrenia be also more common locally compare with other constituency in the uk across yorkshire and the north mental ill health be consistently high than elsewhere in england nhs datum and mental health organisation be clear that both ethnic background and wealth disparity play major role in that gap people in my constituency be more likely to experience mental health condition yet the funding for research and specialised service in the north remain low that mean less support few bed and few opportunity to provide specialist care that be why strongly support new clause which require every hospital to have name person responsible for oversee race equality in how the mental health act be apply black people be still four time more likely to be detain under the act and eight time more likely to be place on community treatment order without accountability those injustice will continue also support new clause table by the hon member for sheffield central abtisam mohamed which seek to put limit on cto we must also do far more for young people the new clause propose by the hon member for hertford and stortford josh dean powerfully argue for give clear say in their own treatment decision mother tell how both of her daughter need mental health support yet she have to seek private care because local service be overstretch and not up to standard she point to the good childhood report which show that the wellbeing of child in the uk be among the low in europe also support new clause which aim urgently to address the need to stop child be place in adult ward or send mile away from home for treatment welcome the work that west yorkshire icb have do recently to expand mental health service for old people but we must match that ambition for child and young people if those commitment can not all be secure through this bill they must be deliver in the forthcoming child wellbeing and schools bill call jen craft to make the final contribution all those who have contribute to the debate should make their way back to the chamber thank you very much madam deputy speaker will be as brief as possible will speak to new clause which stand in my name and which seek to support the government in end the scandal of the inappropriate detention of people with learn disability autism declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on learn disability currently learn disability or autism in and of itself can be ground for detention under the mental health act as we all know this be an absolute scandal something from previous age that should be source of moral shame to everyone in our community the bill seek to address this by remove autism or learn disability in and of themselves as criterion for detention under the mental health act that offer lifeline light in the tunnel of darkness that number of people who be detain under the current act face however the impact assessment for the bill state that the propose change to the detention criterion in clause and will only be switch on when system be able to demonstrate sufficient level of community support the family and carer of those have learn disability or autism and who be detain under the mental health act and the organisation that support they and people who advocate for they know that too often this vulnerable group of people be push to the bottom of list of compete priority and very often slide off it we know that this government and the department of health and social care have number of compete priority to deliver on and the concern for people who fall into this bracket under the legislation be that their concern just will not be address and that this absolute scandal will continue in perpetuity people who have learn disability or autism will be detain because our community service just be not up to snuff we have so categorically fail they that the only thing we can think to do be to lock they away from society will my hon friend give way will not because be aware that be almost out of time my new clause would ensure that the government have to set out within six month of this bill receive royal assent road map that engage in co productive way with people with learn disability or autism their advocate and organisation that champion their right the road map will design what they need to support they to lead independent dignified life in the community and there will be report every year to say how we be get community service to sufficient place so that these much need clause in the bill can be switch on this bill update mental health legislation and bring it into the century it be only right that it do so for everyone in our society include the most vulnerable thank everyone in the chamber for their contribution to today debate will start by talk about the deeply move contribution regard the tragic death of ruth szymankiewicz extend my heartfelt condolence to ruth family and pay tribute to my hon friend the member for isle of wight west mr quigley and the right hon member for salisbury john glen for so powerfully advocate on behalf of ruth and her family the circumstance around ruth death be unacceptable and should never have happen we acknowledge multiple failing in her care turn to the amendment while we be not accept any change to the bill hope that can assure the house in the short time remain that we be take action to address the concern that have rightly be raise in relation to new clause and we absolutely do not want young people place in adult ward and we be clear that patient should get treatment close to home however further legislative restriction on placement risk leave clinician without option in emergency or prevent treatment that be in the patient good interest nhs england have work with hundred of child and family to develop new service specification for child and young people mental health service the specification be for commissioner and provider to follow define the care expect from organisation fund by nhs england to provide specialised care will the minister give way will but have get little time and lot of amendment to address so will not take any further intervention have the privilege of meet helena and christina who share with the challenge they face when their mother be sectioned when they be young girl for two week the responsibility for care be leave entirely in their hand while local service struggle to find suitable bed can the minister confirm that through the mental health bill in conjunction with the children wellbeing and schools bill young carer will be properly identify and that the additional boost in government investment directly into mental health service will ensure that young carer receive the support they need can give my hon friend that assurance one of the core purpose of this bill be to ensure that we catch such issue particularly around the identification of child in case where parent be require to be detain we will reaffirm that child should be treat in the least restrictive most age appropriate environment and close to home and family and that all service would work towards alternative to admission such as day care and intensive home treatment with well support for visit include with dedicated family area and overnight stay we have commit million for system to invest in reduce out of area placement and be pleased to report that the number of child place on adult ward be now decrease and that trend must continue we have also commit in the bill to review the exist cqc notification requirement include whether notification should be extend to other incident and whether the time period remain appropriate we will work with family clinician and mps as part of that review indeed follow recent conversation with my hon friend the member for isle of wight west and for lowestoft jess asato have ask official to host roundtable next month with member and expert on how we can provide great clarity in the code the focus will also be on nhs england service specification and regulation on the placement of child and young people in adult ward include determine if placement be suitable the revised code on which we will engage extensively with among other child and their family and carer will provide further opportunity to address concern raise in amendment and and new clause the code will also address the issue of competency we believe that that be more appropriate than test for competency in the act as propose in new clause and will the minister give way will but can the right hon gentleman please make his intervention very short be grateful to the minister and be also grateful to he for what he say about my constituent there be so many code of good practice and so many guideline can he say little more about what force the code would have so that we can have some reassurance that the risk that be so tragic in the case of my constituent will be eliminate the code of practice will be statutory it be well to have these provision in the code because clinical practice evolve and it be much easy to revise code of practice than to go through primary legislation we understand the concern express about young carer in new clause and and recognise that despite exist duty the right question be not always be ask to identify child when someone be detain while we do not agree that additional legal duty be need especially as multi agency working be already be strengthen through the children wellbeing and schools bill we do agree that we need to make the requirement more explicit the revised code of practice will therefore specify that when someone be detain step must be take to identify the child of the patient information about support that be available must be share and if young carer need assessment be require the appropriate referral must be make will the minister give way be really struggle for time be sorry but can not take any more intervention because it be not fair to member who have table amendment amendment and would prevent child with competence from choose step parent or kinship carer as their nominate person if that be the most appropriate person for they nominated person can be overrule or displace if act against the child good interest parent will always maintain their right under the parental responsibility many amendment concern statutory care and treatment review design to help to ensure that people with learn disability and autistic people receive the right care and treatment while detain and barrier to discharge be overcome review will happen within day of detention and at least once year during detention this can be more frequent depend on need patient family and advocate can request review meeting at any point in respect of new clause we have consult on make some restrictive practice include long term segregation notifiable to the care quality commission within hour let now deal with amendment and and new clause and acknowledge the importance of have clear plan to resource community provision for people with learn disability and autistic people to implement these reform we have commit ourselves to an annual write ministerial statement on implementation of the bill post royal assent follow conversation with my hon friend the member for thurrock jen craft we will work with stakeholder include people with live experience to shape our road map for commence change to clause the write ministerial statement will give update on progress as well as set out future plan it be not possible at this stage for we to commit ourselves to the specific of implementation and community support which depend on the final legislation pass future spending review and engagement with stakeholder to get implementation planning right as for the concern raise by my hon friend the member for shipley anna dixon about the detention criterion in the bill it be vital that the work likelihood be include in those criterion to set clear expectation of what clinician need to consider however we be clear about the fact that our intention be not to set threshold for detention under the new criterion harm do not have to be likely to justify detention the criterion require likelihood to be consider holistically alongside the change nature and degree of the harm know that the shadow minister the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans be keen for to deal with the question of public safety the key point be that there be detention criterion in clause which make clear reference to harm either to the patient or to other person that be clearly consideration of public safety and we therefore believe that amendment be surplus to requirement trust that on the basis of the assurance have give member will be content not to press their amendment and new clause zöe franklin be it your pleasure that new clause be withdraw beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion clause by leave withdraw new clause duty to establish carer liaison service the mental health act be amend as follow in part miscellaneous and supplementary after section insert duty to establish carer liaison service the manager of every hospital provide service under this act must establish and maintain dedicated carer liaison service service establish under this section must provide support to unpaid carer when patient for whom they provide care be await admission to hospital for treatment under the act ii receive treatment in hospital under the act iii set to be discharge from hospital where they have be receive treatment under this act timely and accessible information regard the discharge of the patient they care for include detail of the patient discharge plan and ii aftercare arrangement under section of this act support for unpaid carer to identify their own need and connect to relevant local service for post discharge support include local authority adult social care service general practitioner and local carer centre facilitation of effective communication and collaboration between unpaid carer and the patient multidisciplinary clinical team regard the discharge process assistance to unpaid carer in develop or update carer support plan in the context of the patient discharge include guidance on their right to assessment and support as carer ii their participation in education or employment iii available counselling service iv support in planning for emergency in relation to the patient benefit for the carer and patient and vi other form of local support and service to ensure that the perspective of the unpaid carer as key provider of support be consider during discharge planning where appropriate and with due regard to patient confidentiality and consent dr chambers this new clause would require hospital to establish dedicated liaison service for the carer of patient detain under the mental health act bring up and read the first time question put that the clause be read second time shockat adam jim allister gideon amos lee

profit levy north east scotland motion make and question propose that this house do now botterill secure this debate because what be happen in north east scotland simply can not go on hundred if not thousand of job be be lose on regular basis across our region from the world class energy sector that we be so proud of not least because of the energy profit levy these be geologist engineer technician and project manager highly skilled worker who be nothing but of value to the uk but they be also people with mortgage people with family and people who have give decade to an industry that this government be now destroy through deliberately punitive policy offshore energies uk warn that largely because of the epl and other government policy on the north sea almost direct and indirect job will be lose every month that be livelihood mortgage and family face uncertainty every single month oeuk also project that job be at risk between now and energy worker in north east scotland feel like they be on borrow time no one really celebrate when they manage to survive round of job cut because they know it be likely just to be short term relief with more cut come soon the energy profit levy be introduce in at time when oil and gas price be spike after russia invade ukraine at that time brent crude peak at over barrel and average barrel in similarly in gas peak at therm and average therm that year let we compare that with this year in august brent average barrel and gas therm that be and drop on the average and oil this week be at six month low the energy profit levy have cease to be windfall tax the windfall have go and the price have return to normal level the competition and markets authority find that in oil market be now relatively stable and exceptional circumstance seem to have recede will the hon lady give way mr shannon on the north east of scotland madam deputy speaker speak to the hon lady beforehand to ensure that be here to support she in what she be try to achieve in north east scotland it be very important that we add our support to she do the hon lady agree that while investment in tidal energy have not produce the desire result of sustainable reliable energy the levy on energy profit have achieve result that be absolutely undesirable and be see investment in our country be move to the usa and other region with more favourable approach do she also agree that the economic black hole can not be fill by more levy but must be fill by investment in our business and create future job security commend she completely agree with the hon gentleman will come on to talk about the drain of investment and other thing from north east scotland because of the levy it feel as if it be particularly punitive tax on north east scotland give that our region be the energy hub of the uk even though the windfall no long exist at the budget last year the chancellor still decide that she would increase the epl from to give headline tax of motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now botterill the chancellor also extend the levy until march just to ensure that the industry be hit from all angle she abolish the investment allowance remove the very mechanism that keep company invest pay tribute to the hon lady for secure the debate share her passion for her constituent and their work in the north sea because my constituent over three generation have do the same work and want to see people work in the north sea for another three generation do she accept that some job in the north sea go on the watch of the last government and that the move from fossil fuel to renewable be inevitable and must be manage by thing like passporte people into job we must be honest about the fact that offshore job be dangerous pay tribute to the people who have go out there for the past year to earn our energy security the danger that they put themselves in be simply not the same in the renewable sector do she accept that we must balance the move from gas and oil in the north sea to renewable in the wild atlantic probably with manage transition that look after our community however that do not make it an either or question of have either carbon from oil and gas in the north sea or onshore and offshore renewable we can and will do both and this government should be commit to both for another year completely agree with the hon gentleman at no point have ever say that we should be persist with oil and gas at the expense of renewable we need both but both mean both side we do not need to tax the oil and gas industry out of existence in the north sea in order to scale up renewable because that will do the exact opposite as he know appreciate his point that job have be lose in the past know that because live in the north east of scotland but what happen to oil and gas price during that time be they at peak or in trough they be in trough but they be now not yet we be still see job cut and production decrease fast than it need to because of decision make by this government commend my hon friend on her speech and on secure the debate as she know this issue be also feel incredibly keenly in the neighbouring constituency of west aberdeenshire and kincardine which represent while the debate about whether it be renewable or oil and gas be false one the fact be that skilled worker whose job be be lose in the north sea right now be the exact worker who we will need in the future to deliver clean energy and more sustainable future those job do not exist in the uk right now and they be be lose to the united arab emirates riyadh australia mexico and canada we need to do what we can to maintain those job in north east scotland by support our oil and gas industry and remove the punitive energy profit levy which be drive people away from the country and drive company to make redundancy order remind mr bowie that front bencher do not intervene from the front bench in adjournment debate agree that we want to keep the worker that we have and the skill and expertise that they have develop in north east scotland because they be of huge value to north east scotland they will not stay in north east scotland out of virtue but only if the job be there for they and it make economic sense for the company to keep they there that be not what be happen at the moment and we be lose crucial asset to our energy transition at an extraordinary rate the loss of skill impact investor confidence in the north sea that investor confidence be directly link to investor confidence in renewable give the lack of availability of skill that will result do the hon lady agree that the government need to give an end date for this so call temporary measure as soon as possible and that that need to be implement as soon as practicably possible exactly thank the hon member for that intervention on that point will skip forward little bit to my first question to the minister which be when the treasury will publish its consultation outcome on the future fiscal regime for the north sea and whether the government will wait until to implement that new regime or whether they will implement it straightaway investment decision worth billion be be put on hold wait for that answer they need to know month or ideally week not just vague in due course capital investment forecast for the north sea have fall by from over billion to billion for the period to and offshore energies uk calculate that billion of economic value will be lose under labour epl extension some of oeuk member company be now seek opportunity overseas and aberdeen and grampian chamber of commerce agree warn that the epl be erode investor confidence and drive capital to rival overseas region shell finance chief have call for certainty and stable environment note that the uk tax rate be large than most other country and make it difficult to have confidence in long term investment although norway which the government love to use as comparison have similar tax rate the government know that this be false comparison because norway also offer full capital cost deduction it refund almost of loss to company and give uplift on investment over four year the result be that norway attract time more investment than the uk into the same mature north sea basin norway north sea will see around billion in exploration and production investment through to our will see just billion be from the south west of scotland which be as far from the north east as one can get in scotland none the less this be huge issue for the whole country my hon friend be make point about the north sea basin be mature we always hear that it be mature it be decline but the norwegian investment be exploit area of gas and oil that previously would not have be accessible new technique such as horizontal drilling be deliver huge benefit for the norwegian economy we be deny ourselves those benefit be that not the case it be absolutely the case my hon friend be completely correct we be forgo so many opportunity in the north sea to secure energy for our country and safeguard the skill and job that we will need for the transition there be endless opportunity that for some reason we be willing to leave under the north sea that bring to my second question for the minister do the treasury recognise the damage that the epl be do to the north sea we know that the decline in the north sea do not start with the epl it be mature basin but the epl be accelerate that decline its ripple effect go far beyond the energy producer themselves the supply chain be haemorrhage job hunt in aberdeenshire lay off employee wood group cut job last year belmar engineering enter liquidation this year with redundancy beam in westhill collapse with job lose well safe solutions cut about job and harbour energy have cut job which be of its onshore workforce keep come back to the word that the chancellor say when harbour energy announce its job cut early this year and cite the epl as principal factor she say that this be just commercial decision by one company but the list have give which be not exhaustive be evidence that that be not the case it show that the chancellor either do not understand or do not want to understand the impact the epl be have as be sure other member do regularly visit company in the north east of scotland whose order book for offshore work have completely dry up force they to adapt their business model to other sector just to keep afloat many of those company do not know whether they will be here in month time they be not hire they be struggle to justify investment and in many case they can do nothing more than hope for change in government policy these company be own grow and run by some of the most innovative and entrepreneurial people have ever meet they be not afraid of branch out or try new thing they have do so for their whole business career but they be be back into corner and be run out of option the irony be that this policy be fail on its own term in shrink the very economic activity that it seek to tax the office for budget responsibility originally forecast that the energy profit levy would raise more than billion between and but the revise forecast be billion we be on track to miss the target by billion and revenue from the epl fall from billion to billion between and his majesty revenue and customs figure show that revenue from oil and gas production be down last year when do the treasury last carry out an impact assessment of the epl impact on production job economic activity and tax receipt have those assessment be revisit follow those recent hmrc figure show the downgrade forecast forecast show that the policy could ultimately cost the treasury billion in lose revenue by we have reach the point where the level of taxation mean less money the government be tax the north sea so heavily that tax revenue be be lose we can not tax job that no long exist we can not tax production that no long exist and we can not tax business that no long operate in the uk there be something else that the government be ignore from the early the treasury will face billion to billion cost each year in decommissioning rebate decade early than expect the premature shutdown of field drive by the epl make they too unviable to continue make that liability ever more imminent the policy be also undermine our energy security at time of global instability suppress domestic oil and gas production and increase our dependence on foreign import we be now dependent on energy import by it be project that our reliance on import gas will increase to and our liquefy natural gas import have increase by in the past year alone those change be partly down to geology but the decline be accentuate by the punitive tax regime for company operate out of the north sea estimate suggest that there could be billion barrel of oil equivalent remain in the north sea that could be recover with the right investment we could cover half our energy need to with north sea reserve if we drive investment away we will leave that resource untapped only for import from elsewhere to cover they that be huge loss of economic opportunity for the north east of scotland and the uk as whole that bring to my final question and will soon conclude will the treasury please commit to de link oil and gas pricing in the energy security investment mechanism so that both commodity be assess on their individual market condition time be run out and that be not an exaggeration every month of inaction mean another thousand job go every delay investment decision mean less energy security for britain every skilled worker who leave to go overseas be one we will struggle to get back when we need they for the energy transition and more importantly the oil and gas sector have four question for the minister first when will the consultation outcome be publish secondly do the treasury recognise the damage it be inflict thirdly when be the last impact assessment carry out by the government fourthly will the government de link oil and gas in the energy security investment mechanism the north east of scotland have power britain for year we have contribute hundred of billion in tax revenue we develop expertise that be renowned around the world we have so much more to offer to meet the uk current and future energy need but only if we be give the chance scrap the epl be vital part of that chance let first congratulate the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross on secure this debate thank member from all part of the house for their contribution so far be sure there will be more intervention in the come minute say to the hon member that it be clear how strongly and firmly she seek to represent her constituent and those of her neighbour the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie as resident in north east scotland that come across clearly in the house the uk oil and gas industry play significant role in our country just as it have for more than half century alongside its contribution to our energy supply it have provide more than billion in production taxis since the late and create thousand of job in the hon lady constituency and in many constituency in that part of scotland and across the country as we head towards net zero future the industry and the region will continue to play vital role in the energy transition with which know the sector be keenly engage between and the sector have act to reduce its emission by and we be see oil and gas company make record investment in carbon capture usage and storage on land and in offshore wind at sea agree with the hon member for gordon and buchan that it be not an either or we must have manage transition in which we do all that we can to protect job and industry and to grow new job and industry too we be all pull in the same direction government and industry be commit to fair orderly and prosperous transition for the region and be grateful for the opportunity to speak about that today the aim of our tax regime for the exploration and production of oil and gas in the north sea be to support investment in this vital resource while ensure that the country obtain fair return in exchange for the use of an important national asset be sure the hon member for gordon and buchan will be very familiar with the tax regime and be sure that everyone else in the chamber be but let set it out for the benefit of those who may not be the regime today include ring fence corporation tax that be charge at the supplementary charge at and yes the temporary energy profit levy at as the hon member mention that be introduce amid near record high price follow the recovery from covid and russia invasion of ukraine while we pursue our net zero target we must ensure that we meet the country energy need that involve energy from overseas alongside our own new nuclear wind and solar and of course domestic oil and gas with domestic gas production net of import account for the equivalent of about third of uk gas demand our oil and gas industry support more than job and will continue to play significant role in our energy mix for decade to come in support those job and the important contribution of the sector our approach to taxation be in my view both responsible and proportionate we believe in the ongoing contribution of the oil and gas industry and its skilled workforce and the sector continue to benefit from in tax relief for every of private investment with more relief available for decarbonisation base investment the oil and gas sector be expect to contribute about billion in tax receipt between this financial year and which be roughly equivalent to the entire year nhs scotland budget the energy profit levy alone have already raise more than billion since its introduction yes that be less than be forecast at the time but in way that should be welcome news for the hon member because it mean low energy bill for people up and down the country who be affect by the cost of living family in her constituency and in mine what low revenue from the epl mean be that oil and gas company be not invest in the north sea that production be fall in the north sea and that for example revenue from income tax which the scottish government might quite like be fall as well there be nothing welcome about the government not meet their forecast it be complete madness even to believe that if the hon member would have prefer energy price to stay at their pandemic level and money to continue to flow in from the epl rather than more people throughout the country receive low energy bill that is of course view that she be welcome to hold as be say the levy have raise more than billion since its introduction and be forecast to raise furth billion by that revenue provide vital funding for our public service create sustainable job strengthen our energy security and independence and support the energy transition the government be commit to give the oil and gas industry long term certainty and confidence in the fiscal regime the energy security investment mechanism be the price floor within the epl and that give the sector certainty that if oil and gas price fall for sustained period the epl will cease that remain government policy the hon member ask whether the government intend to de link but the government policy be to stick with esim as it stand know that member have express concern about the approach to tax and how it affect investment in the oil and gas sector but we have see capital expenditure in the sector rise from around billion in to around billion last year that be why we introduce pragmatic reform to the levy at the autumn budget and refrain from go far than abolish the levy investment allowance help to support the sector competitiveness want to restate to the house today that the epl will end no later than march work with the sector and stakeholder the government publish the oil and gas price mechanism consultation on march to give long term certainty on the future fiscal regime develop an approach for how we respond to unusually high price once the epl end as the hon member know the consultation close early this year the government be now hard at work analyse submission and suggestion and we will publish our response will not say in due course will say shortly know that the sector want certainty from the government as to what will follow on from the epl hear that and be meet member of the sector this week to hear it directly from business want this to happen as soon as it can but hope the hon member will understand that it be not quite in my gift unilaterally to announce the date and the precise timetable on the floor of the house understand that there be need for certainty and the government understand just how important that be for business and worker in the sector reassure the house that it be definitely not our intention to wait until the epl be about to cease before bring in new legislation to provide that certainty want we to bring forward the necessary legislation for the new mechanism as quickly as we reasonably can to ensure smooth and orderly transition for the sector that be hugely important and for as long as be in this post will do all can to make sure that we can do that hear the point make by member on both side of the house the government be already deliver fair and orderly transition in the north sea across the country we be drive growth and secure skilled job for future generation and that be just as true in the north sea where we have see unprecedented level of investment in offshore wind and where this government have sign contract for two first of kind carbon capture and storage cluster this endeavour also include great british energy which from its headquarters in aberdeen will create thousand of job across the country invest up to billion in clean energy supply chain and as publicly own energy company ensure that the clean energy revolution be build in britain alongside that the office for clean energy jobs will work to ensure that we have the skilled clean energy workforce to deliver those goal so that this investment unlock thousand of new job kick starts growth in community and industrial town and secure clean and more independent energy future for the uk will the minister give way will the minister give way shall take both intervention number of skilled job be go out of the north sea and many of these worker will go to other country that be the point make by the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie that be not sustainable for the skill transfer into the offshore renewable sector and it be dent investor confidence there be serious risk that the build out of offshore renewable will not go fast enough if investor confidence disappear because of skill loss it be hugely important that the epl be address as quickly as possible to prevent that from continue as say just few moment ago job be directly or indirectly link to the work and activity in this sector and it be vital that we support people with that transition in the long term carbon capture and storage alone be expect to support skilled job by as we move towards clean energy transition be acutely aware have hear it from opposition members and be sure that will hear it from my hon friend in second that we must get the balance right between the timing of phase out and wind down production in the north sea and ramp up the clean energy and good job that we need for the future we have to do all we can to protect the sector will the minister give way on that point will first take the intervention from my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur thank the minister for give way but note that he take my intervention second rather than first be not offend on the position in scotland it be worthe remember that scotland deputy first minister say at the snp party conference at the weekend that the scottish government want to scrap the epl sorry mean they want to replace it with something else but of course she do not say what that something else be it be slightly cowardly not to define that detail the minister be talk about the strength of the renewable sector in the uk and how it be grow under this government and we all appreciate and welcome that but that sector also need continuity and stable framework to work within do he therefore share my concern about the opposition take the decision to ditch the climate change act which have really unsettle the whole industry believe the hon member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter be slightly quick in stand up than my hon friend do understand my hon friend point it be very important not to be cowardly in politic which be why will make sure that we come forward as fast as we can to set out the approach after the epl be set to end this government under the leadership of whole range of cabinet ministers be make sure that we can provide that long term certainty not chop and change when it come to our policy on net zero the hon member for gordon and buchan mention energy security which link to the challenge we have with energy bill it be worth recognise the truth that even if we extract every single drop of oil and gas in the north sea that would not make any material difference to people energy bill or the price that people pay at the pump oil and gas be trade on international market and give the decline basin on the uk continental shelf domestically produce oil and gas do not do anything to reduce price in fact it be our reliance on oil and gas that leave british consumer expose to unstable fossil fuel market in closing this government be determined to provide balance rise do the hon member really wish to intervene interruption go on thank the minister for give way on that point this be about balance we need to find balance in the transition of people come out of oil and gas and move into renewable the difficulty be that we can not say to these highly skilled people that there be great job for they in renewable but it be go to be year down the line that be no use to they at all they have bill to pay and family to feed the balance be out of kilter and be afraid that the government be get this wrong disagree that the government be get this wrong we be do our good to try to find the right balance to support people industry and job we will continue to provide balanced responsible and predictable regime for the uk oil and gas industry which hope will continue to drive growth support worker and community protect our energy security and ensure prosperous future for the north sea as we make our way towards net zero our commitment and my commitment as minister to the future of the north sea be clear and will continue to engage closely with the industry worker and member across the house on this important issue again thank the hon member for gordon and buchan for secure this important discussion and thank member from across the house for their contribution question put and agree to house adjourn
