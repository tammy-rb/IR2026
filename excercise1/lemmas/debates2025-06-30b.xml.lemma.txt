home what assessment have the secretary of state make of the success of forces help to buy what plan do he have to extend it unfortunately force help to buy really have not keep pace either with demand or with the success of civilian programme it be part of the force housing review that have launch which expect to report in the autumn the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that the aspiration of those who serve and who join the service be exactly the same as for every other work person in this country we should try to make that part of the contract that this nation make with those who will serve in future housing be not the only issue affect armed force family when member of the force move their family often move with they my work experience student amy who be in the gallery today be from an armed force family and attend three primary school one school provide dedicated support whereas other have less understanding of the issue that child whose parent be in the

the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome the recent announcement of funding to improve military housing but our fantastic service personnel deserve more than short term fix this year armed force continuous attitude survey show that one in five personnel plan to leave and over quarter of they cite the standard of accommodation as reason that should be wake up call will the government commit to go far and show real commitment to retention by finally turn on their decision to block liberal democrat proposal to bring all military housing under the decent home standard no one could describe the decision to buy back military family home from private hand as short term fix nobody could describe the consumer charter set out basic housing right and standard as short term fix and no one could describe the housing strategy review we have get go as short term fix the decent home standard be one standard think we can be do well by our armed force family support veteran what step he be take to support veteran in hertfordshire what step he be take to support veteran what step he be take to ensure that veteran receive adequate support after leave the armed force first would like to recognise mr roy briggs world war two veteran who recently pass those of we on both side of the house salute our great generation as the secretary of state say we recently announce op valour the veteran support

funeral last week he be real servant to our country have fly in many brave mission over europe he be part of one of the raf first ever humanitarian mission when drop essential food over the netherlands and he also fly many mission in raf bomber know that the government be do various thing to try to support veteran could the minister outline the further step that the government can take to support organisation that support veteran such as the royal british legion as well as small organisation such as the hemel armed force and veteran breakfast club the armed force covenant trust fund be one of the mechanism we use to support the charitable sector but we must also step back and look holistically at the fact that there be armed force charity in the uk op valour will help to synthesise that get more bang for buck and ensure that veteran get the right support where and when they need it local charity in my area support woman veteran be recently work with woman who be rehome in general purpose support accommodation for veteran in scotland the accommodation be entirely unsuitable for she as survivor of sexual violence and lead to she be subject to further sexual assault by man who be also house there will the minister assure of his work to ensure appropriate support for woman veteran just last week visit several different organisation one of which be launchpad in liverpool which show some example of support housing for veteran it be not lose on that female veteran have different requirement and we need to do more to support they we will ensure that that be cater for by have woman section as part of our veteran strategy welcome the government investment in support veteran but as my hon friend the member for glastonbury and somerton sarah dyke mention recently in the house female veteran be about less likely to be employ after service than male veteran what specific step be the government take to address that imbalance thank the hon member for that really important question there be two piece that would highlight the first be the armed force career transition partnership which help individual during the two year prior to their leave the service and for two year after to find job the second be operation ascend which look to partner career opportunity and business of which we have engage with over with any veteran or individual leave the armed force which have engage with individual part of our veteran strategy will include that from woman perspective we be do everything we can and over of veteran who seek help go straight into employment within the first six month there be veteran in my constituency of which be disabled many be concerned about the future support available to they can the minister assure disabled veteran not just in south northamptonshire but across the country what the department will do and that it will not forget they that be an exceptionally valid point just last week hold consultation with the disability minister to ensure that veteran charity which really speak loudly for veteran and could highlight any concern to he that be include within the consultation defence procurement sme what step his department plan to take through the defence industrial strategy to support sme what step he be take to ensure that sme be able to participate in defence procurement contract the government modern industrial strategy launch last week announce increase in mod spend with small and medium sized enterprise to billion year by reverse the downward trend under the previous government our new sme hub will help small firm to access well opportunity and our reform of defence procurement along with ringfenced innovation fund will give sme access to the defence dividend this government increase in defence spending will provide job and growth across the uk basingstoke be home to some fantastic defence sme include nightball technologies and bertin exensor but one issue that have be raise with be that government procurement agency can not specify uk sovereign tech or sole source contract even where uk capability exist that result in lengthy competitive tender where there be high risk that end user do not get the capability that they need and equipment be buy from foreign supplier will the minister meet with and firm from basingstoke to discuss how we can prioritise uk defence sme over foreign supplier especially where uk sovereign tech exist my hon friend make an interesting point there be some flexibility under our procurement rule to specify national security ground upon which to make decision half our spend be already through sole source contract be of course happy to meet he and his sme we be deliver for defence by promote new procurement model that be easy for small firm to access and our sme hub will engage directly with sme to help they to access defence supply chain in my constituency of north somerset many small and medium sized enterprise be spring up to support our country rearmament effort in nailsea one such company industries be recently block from open business bank account due to blanket prohibition and excessive delay by retail bank hinder its ability to organise seed funding and bid for procurement contract will the minister meet with to discuss the case of industries and the wide problem relate to financial institution and their interaction with defence sme that the case highlight recognise my hon friend point and will of course meet with he and his sme over the last six month the defence secretary and have convene stakeholder from industry and finance to discuss this issue and make it clear that defence be an ethical sector that they should support the strategic defence review commit we to develop dedicated financial service sector strategy which we will aim to publish in spring that should give we further opportunity to make sure that the finance industry know what good investment defence can be our uk defence industry can have few well ambassador around the world than our red arrows as the hawk aircraft come to an end will the minister look closely at the british design modular aircraft be develop by aeralis because it would support sme right across our country include by bring around job to standardaero in gosport and about to the south hampshire area surely that would be much well way to support our national sme than opt for the italian russian aircraft which the mod be rumour to prefer know aeralis well visit it when be in opposition as know the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge have do and have speak to its representative since of course an open competition will be hold for the new aircraft to deliver advanced jet training and for an aircraft for the raf aerobatic team to ensure value for money and positive uk benefit and hope that aeralis will apply for that competition it will have very good chance if its product be up to scratch thank the minister for her answer she be regular visitor to northern ireland and support the sme there so when it come to the defence industrial strategy to support sme could she update the house and myself in particular on what she and the government be do to help sme in northern ireland to increase job and also increase contract the hon gentleman be right to say that have visit northern ireland and its defence sector on number of occasion and hope to return and do so again the increase in spend that be announce last monday on the modern industrial strategy for our sme to take advantage of an increase of up to billion year should give opportunity for some of the innovative company in northern ireland to take advantage of the available money when our sme hub get up and run it will be available to assist small firm in understand how good to get access to some of the opportunity that that will bring defence sector exports what step he be take to support defence sector export in order to deliver for defence and make defence manufacture an engine for growth we must improve our export performance potential customer want consistent government to government offer so as part of defence reform new national armament director and defence export office will support defence export campaign and responsibility for the promotion of defence export will be transfer to the ministry of defence it be welcome news that mod be commit to the establishment of defence export office will the minister set out what this will mean at home for job in constituency such as mine in stoke on trent central where our proud manufacturing company stand ready to support uk defence and security it will mean coherent specialist approach to government to government agreement on sale of our capability be base in the mod which have expertise in those capability this be go to mean extra job and growth and that job can continue in the uk beyond the delivery of our own domestic order because there will be export order to fulfil that should reap defence dividend across the nation and region of the uk as our manufacturing job continue to deliver for defence ametek defence manufacturer in my constituency have report to that the process of get defence export licence have almost grind to halt in the past month could the ministry of defence send someone sufficiently threaten round to the department for business and trade perhaps the veterans minister to persuade it to get grip of its process and speed everything up be sure that we can make representation to that department to ensure that there be no unnecessary delay in application for export be grant where that be appropriate ukraine military support what recent discussion he have have with ally on military support for ukraine at last week nato summit meet defence ministers include ukrainian defence minister umerov about surge support into ukraine with the uk also announce last week that hundred more advanced short range air to air missile asraam would be deliver to ukraine start in the next few week last monday join the prime minister in host president zelensky in no where we discuss the ongoing detailed planning for the coalition of the willing and be proud to say that three and half year into putin illegal invasion this house and this country remain united for ukraine yesterday alarm report indicate that russia have launch its large air attack on ukraine since the war begin kill at least six people and injure many more clearly regardless of his claim putin be not ready for peace give russia continue aggression what step be the government take alongside nato ally to increase pressure on russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire my hon friend be right last night attack be reminder of just how fierce the russian onslaught on ukraine be but it be also reminder that putin have fail in his strategic ambition three and half year into this campaign he have pass the gruesome milestone of million russian casualty on the battlefield and he be fail to take the territory that he think would fall to he be proud that the uk have step up with leadership on ukraine with the coalition of the willing alongside the french and by chair the ukraine defence contact group alongside the germans and that we will spend more than billion this year on uk military aid to ukraine which be the high ever level call the shadow secretary of state associate myself with the secretary of state comment on those terrible attack it should be source of pride that some of the good drone and counter drone tech that we have supply to ukraine have be make by british sme the problem be that labour procurement freeze mean that almost none of it have be buy in parallel for our own armed force in this week of labour turn will the secretary of state consider another one namely scrap the government crazy billion chagos deal and instead spend the money on rapidly supply drone for the british army so that it can train for war as it be be fight today in ukraine that be bit of bucket question on drone we be increase tenfold the number of british drone that we will supply to ukraine this year we be also step up the lesson we be learn from work with ukraine on the development of its technology battlefield harden and combat ready so that we can supply our own force with increase number of drone as part of the strategic defence review vision for the way that we transform our force in the year ahead operation banner legal protection for veterans what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for northern ireland on the adequacy of legal protection for veteran who serve in operation banner the veteran who serve under op banner serve to protect civilian life and secure the peace in northern ireland share the right hon gentleman deep concern that many may now be catch up in investigation or litigation and be determined that we protect they far be work closely with the northern ireland secretary as be our official to ensure that we discharge our duty to the veteran as part of the necessary plan to repeal and replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act during operation banner every single time paramilitary be kill by british soldier it be subject to judicial investigation the director of public prosecutions go through the evidence at the time interview people look at the planning document and be able to talk to people contemporaneously while they could still remember it it be not rubber stamp it be rigorous as be prove by the fact that where necessary it lead to prosecution what be happen now be double jeopardy worse still it be double jeopardy under new rule but with no new evidence indeed there be risk of lose evidence and lose memory give the passage of time have hear what the secretary of state have say but will he commit to ensure that soldier who be subject to review at the time will not be subject to further risk of prosecution under the government replacement for the legacy act any incoming government would have to repeal the legacy act it be unlawful legislation it have be reject by domestic court and reject by community across northern ireland and it be simply wrong for anyone to suggest otherwise we owe it to those affect by the trouble whom the right hon gentleman speak about include our armed force community and veteran to be honest about the unworkability of that legacy act and to get this legislation right that be exactly what the northern ireland secretary and be work together to ensure we can do take full account of all the interested party in particular those veteran and armed force community that the right hon gentleman speak about call the shadow minister accord to the census there be more than million veteran live in great britain clearly some of they have be busy lately their parliamentary petition entitle protect northern ireland veterans from prosecutions with support from the daily mail the express and other now have more than signature and will be debate in parliament on july which minister will respond to that debate so that we can ask they why the government current remedial order be draft to help the like of gerry adams sue the british taxpayer while throw our veteran to the wolf we welcome the petition and we certainly welcome the parliamentary debate it be quite proper that parliament debate these issue the right hon gentleman legacy act offer false and undeliverable promise to the veteran of northern ireland the last government be warn that it would be unlawful and incompatible with the windsor framework even the chief commissioner of the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery say that the act have obvious problem and that element of it be dead in the water from the beginning we be now fix that flawed and fail legislation and we will do so in way that honour our duty towards those veteran the government could have appeal to the supreme court on this but deliberately do not do not doubt the secretary of state personal sincerity however at prime minister question on january the prime minister promise veteran we be work on draft remedial order and replacement legislation and we will look at every conceivable way to prevent these type of case from claim damage it be important that say that on the record official report january vol why then despite the pm solemn promise be the order still unchanged surely he be not expect to order his own mp many of whom represent red wall seat from which those veteran be originally recruit through the aye lobby just to do gerry adams favour he be not go to do that be he the prime minister be right then and he be right now be work with the northern ireland secretary to repeal and replace the legacy act we will honour the prime minister undertaking to this house and do right by the duty that this nation hold to those veteran who serve for more than year during the trouble in northern ireland red arrows what step he be take to maintain the capability of the red arrows the strategic defence review recommend that the hawk and be replace with cost effective advanced jet trainer the future platform of the royal air force aerobatic team be be consider at the same time and royal air force programme team be be establish to deliver that capability the aircraft be world beater unfortunately the only thing that it could not beat in dog fight be labour government who know the cost of everything and the value of nothing will the minister assure that we have learn the lesson of and that we will look at the replacement for the hawk in the light of press british design and manufacture aircraft that can sell britain abroad the conservative party set as the hawk out of service date in its strategic defence and security review and it then do precisely nothing to achieve replacement in the nine year that follow so be disinclined to take lesson from the hon gentleman party on how to replace the hawk assure he that the competition will welcome any bid from uk base supplier shipbuilding supply line what step he be take to ensure an always on approach to the shipbuilding supply line as outline in the strategic defence review and in the uk modern industrial strategy the government be commit to support an always on shipbuilding industry by leverage our buying power through public procurement and seek to export our capability to friendly nation as the minister say the sdr speak of the need for an always on supply of shipbuilding with the royal navy continue to move towards more powerful but cheap and simple fleet the minister have visit my constituency and see the construction of the type frigate by babcock at rosyth with the first ship hms venturer recently float off other ship of the initial five order by the royal navy be progress well when can we expect to see announcement to guarantee the continue always on supply of shipbuilding and will she give an update on the need for more type frigate for the royal navy to reflect the flexibility of that platform as well as the low cost and fast production achieve by the incredible workforce at rosyth in my constituency recognise the benefit that the construction of type frigate have bring to rosyth and have personally engage with international partner to try to secure future order in addition to any order that we ourselves may have export that type of capability to our ally and friend be sensible way of ensure that we can keep production go at rosyth defence spending cross party talks if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of hold cross party talk on increase defence spending to of gdp by at last week nato summit all nation sign up to new defence investment pledge of of gdp by include for the first time spend on national security national resilience and homeland security that build on this government billion boost to defence this year the funded and cost plan to hit of gdp in two year time and our ambition to hit in the next parliament there be great deal of experience across these benches and most of we recognise the imminence of the need to hit my expertise be in force protection and know among other thing that brize norton can not draw support from the military provost guard service under the land top level budget such as at nearby dalton barrack and south cerney that be more acute still at raf lossiemouth will the minister meet to discuss the command structure of the mpgs and bring our experience to the table to find that of gdp imminently my hon friend the minister for the armed forces will be happy to meet the hon gentleman he would be much well person to meet than on this matter call the chair of the defence committee uk defence company need certainty from the government in order to invest and plan with confidence welcome the prime minister recent effort at the and nato summit and his commitment to spend of gdp on defence by include on defence and security relate investment can the secretary of state clarify how exactly that will be measure will it involve new project and investment or will it merely be reclassification of exist project crucially how can industry public body and other stakeholder contribute so that they can help to achieve that goal my hon friend ask characteristically search question so let send he the nato criterion that be publish alongside the pledge last week and let he and his committee when they interrogate on wednesday afternoon pursue any further question that they might have there be member on the government front bench who know thing or two about leadership can say that with confidence because the prime minister be not in that place the government have command majority and do not need the support of member from any other benches to hit of gdp and far if only the leadership of the labour party could get its own members of parliament through the division lobby give that the prime minister show no ability to do that with the change to welfare how will he ensure that be spend on defence in timely manner the conservatives hollow out and underfunde defence for year those be not my word but those of the right hon gentleman former cabinet colleague ben wallace this year there have be billion boost in defence spending but in his government first year in there be billion cut in defence just as we boost defence spending this year we will increase it to by which be three year early than the right hon gentleman argue for we have show exactly how we will fund that we have take the decision which he do not take to switch funding from overseas development aid into defence and just as we have show where the money be come from in this parliament in the next parliament we will do the same too welcome the commitment to get to of gdp on defence spending by it be imperative that the increase in defence spending mean that funding be get to those on the cutting edge of defence innovation cody technology park in farnborough be already home to world class defence innovation with wide range of small and medium sized enterprise work there alongside qinetiq and it be where dragonfire have just be develop what role do the minister see for exist place such as cody in deliver our defence industrial strategy will she meet to discuss whether cody could be the home for the new defence sme hub see huge role hope that my hon friend take the commitment that the chancellor and make alongside the spring statement to set new target for direct defence investment in sme as sign of that commitment while be in the business of commit my ministerial colleague to meeting know that my right hon friend the minister for defence procurement and industry would be only too happy to meet she and to draw on her expertise as part of the development of our defence industrial strategy call the shadow minister on defence spending be not the truth that labour promise to reach of gdp let alone or be just smoke and mirror because there be no actual plan to pay for it how can the government claim that they will properly invest in our defence and keep the country safe when they can not even deliver the limited saving they have promise on welfare so ask the secretary of state where be the money come from welcome the hon gentleman to the dispatch box and to the conservative front bench team alongside his two very distinguished colleague the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois and the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge gently say to he that since the election his colleague the shadow defence secretary argue time for by he only change his tune after february when the prime minister show how it be go to be fund and say that we would do it three year early in we have show how we will raise the extra funding for this record increase in investment in defence since the end of the cold war we have show exactly how it be cost and exactly how it will be fund in this parliament and in the next parliament we will do the same call the liberal democrat spokesperson the government commitment to reach on gdp on defence spending be the right decision as we face the once in generation threat from russia it be vital that we regenerate our armed force after year of decline under the conservatives however we need more urgency the international institute for strategic studies warn that if there be ceasefire in ukraine russia could pose significant military challenge to nato ally as early as in order to strengthen our defence we need to give people well incentive to join the armed force will the minister consider accelerate recruitment by back the liberal democrat proposal for signing bonus to attract new recruit we be accelerate recruitment we be deal with the deep seat and long run failure in recruitment because the previous government over year set and then fail to meet their own recruitment target we be deal with the recruitment and retention crisis in the armed force be proud to say that last year we give the armed force the big pay rise for over year that this year there will be another inflation bust pay rise and that we be start to provide well pay well kit well housing and well support for force family the sort of thing that will keep those valuable and value member of the armed force serve our country and protect we all uk mauritius chagos agreement what estimate he have make of the cost to his department of the uk mauritius agreement concern the chagos archipelago include diego garcia as the defence secretary have say the cost of the agreement represent less than of the annual mod budget this have secure unrestricted access to and use of the base on diego garcia control over movement of all person and good on the base and control of all communication and electronic system it be good deal do not know that agree with the minister that this be good deal although be curious about the billion do it count towards the new nato target of or the additional on top of that as we have to inform the mauritian government before we do anything particularly useful from that base should that cost actually be count in the defence number at all let squash the hon gentleman last comment which be wrong we do not have to inform mauritius before take any military action under the treaty we have to provide notification after the event have explain this time in write answer to member on the conservative front bench but be afraid that they still do not get it that underline why they could not do deal after round of negotiation whereas this government do it after two round secure the future of that vital base for uk and us operation be it not the case that our close ally the united states australia canada new zealand and even india have all welcome this deal precisely because they recognise the irreplaceable role of diego garcia in global security what do the minister think be go on with the opposition who think they know more about global security than the security service the white house and the pentagon this be important because the future of diego garcia be absolutely vital have accept the principle that sovereignty could be secure only by negotiate settlement that be the decision take by the last government it be right that we secure deal and right that we protect the base for operation for more than year the deal be good value for the uk taxpayer because it secure the most valuable piece of military real estate on the planet and keep it under uk control for the next century and beyond uk military bases security what step he be take to increase security at military basis in the uk follow the disgraceful criminal vandalism that we see at raf brize norton we immediately implement series of enhanced security measure at that air base and at other defence site to ensure the safety of personnel asset and operation the strategic defence review highlight brize norton as be in need of investment after the hollowing out of our armed force over the previous year we have direct that wide review be carry out at pace to assess and ensure protective security at all defence site phase of that review be complete this weekend and will make far wide announcement in due course to what extent be the ministry of defence work with other government agency to ensure join up response to emerge threat to military equipment and infrastructure counter terrorism police be still investigate the incident at raf brize norton and it be right that we allow they the space to complete that investigation the wide review look at security at not just raf brize norton but all defence site we be look with colleague across government at what investment be need and at how we can work with other to secure the safety of site to ensure that the uk maintain operational security for all its asset almost by definition raf site have to have very long perimeter fence so it be understandable that they could be overcome at one point or another why be they apparently not fit with sensor at least so that any intrusion would have sound the alarm do not want to pre empt the finding of all the review but the right hon gentleman be right that our air basis tend to cover large area the perimeter fence we inherit on many of our air basis be not design to keep everyone out with large thing but to be perimeter defence in the ongoing security work we be look at how technological solution and change in guard might contribute to enhanced security give the increase threat that we face autonomous weapons systems what assessment he have make of the adequacy of regulation on the use of autonomous weapon system the strategic defence review set out that the uk will harness new technology through dynamic network of crewed uncrewed and autonomous system we will always comply with the relevant regulatory framework and international humanitarian law can tell my hon friend that ihl compliance be absolutely essential as we look to use more artificial intelligence enable weapon system in the future the strategic defence review rightly emphasise the importance of autonomous weapon system in augment the uk defence capability but it also note the uk competitor be unlikely to adhere to common ethical standard in develop and use those technology what specific measure be the government take to help prevent and mitigate the potential harm of autonomous capability both in the uk and abroad my hon friend be absolutely right we maintain responsible ai system in the face of adversary perhaps use ai in malign way the uk will adhere to our legal obligation and the value of the society that we serve through the un and other process we be actively engage in international dialogue on responsible ai lethal autonomy and related strategic challenge but all our activity will be in compliance with international humanitarian law topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility last week nato nation come together at the summit in the hague unite in collective deterrence and in our collective defence of the euro atlantic area can report to the house that nato be now big strong and more lethal than before we sign new defence investment pledge of of gdp by with new capability commitment from each nation it be good day for nato good day for british job and bad day for putin everyone at the summit agree that iran should never have nuclear weapon we all want the ceasefire between israel and iran to hold and we will work to support it finally we also discuss it create new opportunity for ceasefire in gaza which would be vital step on the path to peace be grateful to the secretary of state for his response now that the prime minister have make cast iron commitment to meet nato defence spending target will the secretary of state make similarly welcome commitment to cross party talk to establish credible and durable path towards meet that goal ahead of nato capability review welcome the liberal democrats support for the commitment we have make at nato the leader of the opposition be unable to offer that support at prime minister question last week if the hon gentleman have idea about how we should fund that commitment in the next parliament would be perfectly happy to hear they nothing matter more than home so welcome the huge progress that have be make on force housing over the past month especially for force family do the minister agree that the opposition half bake reprivatisation plan would be huge threat to those in the armed force and their family that be really valid point the trouble be that the plan risk the deal we have with annington it would outsource all the housing and take control away from the government the ministry of defence and the military family who would be live in that housing our housing strategy will come in after the summer and it will be well think through and deliver call the shadow secretary of state do the secretary of state support the action take by the united states to bomb iranian nuclear facility as say in my response to the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton we be absolutely determined that iran should never have nuclear weapon we have be work with ally on diplomatic path now that ceasefire be in place the mind of all nato leader include president trump be on put our weight behind that diplomatic path that be the way towards ensure sustainable and verifiable end to any nuclear programme it be extraordinary that british secretary of state for defence be unable to give his explicit support to the military action of our close ally the united states be the real reason why labour can not back us military action against iran not the same as the reason why it will not turn on chagos or on northern ireland veteran that when it come to choose between legal theory and the national interest this prime minister be lawyer not leader absolute rubbish the uk and the us be the very close of defence intelligence and national security partner the us be strongly behind the deal we have do on diego garcia because it know that that deal secure the operational sovereignty there of the uk and the us for the next year and beyond itp aero support over job in hucknall in my constituency recently go to visit the site with representative from unite to meet those highly skilled worker who be essential not only in support our defence sector but for protect our national security what be this government do to ensure that work do under future contract be complete in the uk by uk worker thank my hon friend for highlight the vital role of itp aero on some of our most important defence platform not least typhoon and the the strategic defence review make it clear that we will back british base business where possible and itp aero be already help to show that defence be an engine for growth in her community in response to my write parliamentary question the minister for the armed forces say that the ministry of defence assess support to foreign force on case by case basis uk training course promote british value include human right and international humanitarian law how do that response square with our continued support of israel war crime in gaza will dual national serve in the israel defence forces be hold accountable all action of the uk government be in compliance with international humanitarian law we want to see an immediate ceasefire in gaza we have few than five personnel from israel on non combat academic course currently but we keep all our training under review minister will be aware of the recent launch of xv excalibur in the south of

devastation cause by modern missile germany be prepare to receive the arrow missile defence system order just two year ago which can intercept intercontinental missile at km what plan have the

boost to our armed force to veteran and to the people of cleethorpes cadet be wonderful source of social mobility in our country and play key role in last weekend armed forces day celebration want to recognise my brilliant local air cadet walthamstow and leyton squadron and wanstead and woodford squadron will the minister set out the government approach to increase the size of cadet force in community like mine so that everyone can benefit from the opportunity that cadet have to offer thank my hon friend for all his support for cadet force and the armed force it would be remiss of not to say that cadet force provide an excellent social mobility platform for young child across the country by give they hope priority and principle and push they to be determine this government have commit to raise the cadet force by and to give more child across the country well opportunity it be pleasure to be the president of chorley cadet welfare reform with permission will make statement on the government welfare reform this government believe in equality and social justice and we be determined to build fairer society in which everyone have the chance to fulfil their potential and achieve their ambition no matter where they be bear or what their parent do we know as all labour government have know that the only way of unlock the potential of individual and of our country as whole be to collectively provide real opportunity and real support be proud of the step that this government have already take to deliver on our promise of well future for all interruption we be create more good job in every part of the country include through our modern industrial strategy and plan for clean energy we order say to those on the opposition front bench that the statement have only just start you might not be interested but know my constituent be expect the same courtesy when you speak we be invest in our vital transport infrastructure and in skill and get the nhs back on its foot our landmark employment rights bill will improve the quality of work and our increase in the national minimum wage be help make work pay but alongside these vital step we need to reform the welfare state the principle set out in our pathway to work green paper be root in value that know many mps share that those who can work must work but often need proper support to do so that those who can never work must be protect and that the welfare state must be fair both for those who need support and for taxpayer so that it be sustainable for generation to come but the system we inherit from the conservative party be fail on all those front it incentivise people to define themselves as incapable of work just to be able to afford to live it then write they off and deny they any help or support the result be million of our fellow citizen now out of work due to long term sickness and almost million young people not in education employment or training which be staggering one in eight of all our young people the future sustainability of the system have also be put at risk with the number of people on personal independence payment set to more than double this decade to over million with award increase at twice the rate of increase in the prevalence of disabled people in our society add new pip award every single day know that government members have welcome many aspect of our reform our plan to bring in the first ever sustain above inflation rise to the universal credit standard allowance the first permanent real term increase in the headline rate of out of work benefit since the which be an historic change in the direction of public policy the big ever investment in employment support for sick and disabled people quadruple what we inherit from the tories to billion year our plan to ensure that people with severe lifelong health condition will never be reassess remove all the unnecessary and unacceptable anxiety this bring and our plan to legislate for right to try guarantee that try work in and of itself will never lead to benefit reassessment and give people the confidence to take the plunge and try work which many organisation have call for for year however there have also be real concern about our initial proposal we have listen carefully and we be make positive change as result first and foremost many member of the house alongside disabled people and their organisation have be very concerned about require exist claimant to score minimum of four point on at least one activity to be eligible for the daily living component of pip when they be reassess after november they have also be concern that the pace of change be too fast fully understand that even though nine out of people claim pip when the change come in would be unaffected by the end of this parliament this have cause deep and widespread anxiety among exist claimant because they rely on the income from pip for so many different aspect of their life so we will now ensure that the new four point requirement will apply only to new claim from november this mean that no exist claimant will lose pip because of the change bring forward in the universal credit and personal independence payment bill and exist claimant of passporte benefit such as carer allowance will continue to get they too some people have say they be concerned that this will create two tier system but say to the house include conservative members that our benefit system often protect exist claimant from new rate or new rule because life have be build around that support and it be often very hard for people to adjust for example some people still receive the severe disablement allowance which be close to new claim in when labour introduce the local housing allowance in exist claimant stay on the old high rate of housing benefit and many people be still on disability living allowance which pip replace in we believe that protect exist claimant while begin to focus pip on those with high need for new claimant strike the right and fair balance the second important question raise by member be about see more detail of our wide review of the pip assessment before be ask to vote on the change in the bill many mp also want to know that the view and voice of disabled people will be hear at the heart of our plan so we have today publish the term of reference for our wide pip review lead by the minister for social security and disability to ensure that this vital benefit be fit for the future take account of change in society since it be first introduce the review will look at the role of the pip assessment include activity descriptor and the associated point to ensure that they properly capture the impact of long term health condition and disability in the modern world it will be co produce with disabled people their organisation clinician other expert and mp before report to the secretary of state by autumn next year and implement as soon as possible thereafter the third issue of concern be that our plan to freeze the universal credit health top up for exist claimant and for future claimant with severe lifelong health condition and those at the end of life would not protect income in real term even with the increase in the universal credit standard allowance can today confirm that we will ensure for those group the combine value of the universal credit standard allowance and the health top up will rise at least in line with inflation protect their income from these benefit in real term every year for the rest of this parliament together with the change to our proposal for pip that will ensure that no exist claimant be put into poverty as result of the change in the bill finally while there have be widespread support for the extra investment that we be put into employment support for sick and disabled people know that many labour members have be concern that that be not enough can today announce that we be put an additional million into employment support for sick and disabled people we will be deliver total of million for support next year million the year after and billion in increase our total spending on employment support for sick and disabled people to billion over this parliament because disabled people who can work should not wait to have the same right and chance to work as everybody else the measure that we be announce today will cost around billion in and the overall saving and costing of our reform package will be certify by the office for budget responsibility in the normal way at the next fiscal event welfare reform be never easy but it be essential because there be no route to equality or social justice base on great benefit spending alone the path to fairer society where everyone can thrive where people who can work get the support they need and where we protect those who can not work that be the path we seek to build with our reform our plan be root in fairness for those who need support and for taxpayer they be about ensure the welfare state survive so that there be always safety net for those who need it and that it last for generation to come above all our reform be root in our fundamental belief that everyone can fulfil their potential and live their hope and dream if we provide they with the right help and support this be the well future that we seek to build for our constituent and our country commend this statement to the house thank the right hon lady for advance sight of her statement this be government in chaos open rebellion from their own back benchers unfunded turn cost billion and welfare plan that be not worth the paper they be write on their late idea be two tier welfare system to trap people in lifetime on benefit and deny they the dignity of work while leave the taxpayer to pick up the ever grow bill it be long hold conservative belief that those who can work should work work provide security and purpose that be why we launch universal credit simplify complex benefit and ensure that work always pay and it work in the decade up to the pandemic we get the number of people on benefit and the benefit bill itself down some job be create for every day that we be in office give million of people the dignity and security that work bring but then during the pandemic we see something new the health and disability bit of our benefit system start to break the bill be forecast to hit billion by one in every four pound of income tax will be spend on health and disability benefit more than the entire defence budget that be not fair for the taxpayer not fair for people who be write off and certainly not sustainable for the country despite labour have year in opposition and now year in government they still do not have plan to bring down the welfare bill or get people into work what we have before we now be rushed and chaotic compromise that be not reform in any sense of the word it be woefully unambitious about saving conspicuously lack in compassion and achieve no meaningful change of system we all know be break thank to the government late climbdown we be leave with plan that will save just billion of billion bill by introduce two tier system two people diagnose with parkinson week apart will now receive different level of support all to clear up an internal labour argument the government own impact assessment show that these plan will not get single person into work the idea that work be the guide motivation for these change be laughable there be thing that the government could do they could reform the fit note system which see of people who apply tell that they be too sick to do any work at all they could say today that they would make all sickness benefit assessment face to face they could get grip of the rise claim for common mental health problem such as anxiety and depression claim for those and neurodevelopmental condition such as adhd be the main reason for the steep rise in the number of people on sickness benefit make up more than half of all new claim the centre for social justice have find that the government could save up to billion by reform those benefit however nothing that we have see from labour over the past couple of week suggest that it have the courage and conviction to grip that problem in the meantime our welfare bill will only continue to rise we agree on the need for reform and have set out the condition under which we would support the government first the welfare budget must come down secondly we need to get people back into work thirdly there must be no new tax rise to pay for increase in welfare spending but with the welfare bill ever grow unemployment rise and job disappear the bill fail on all account will the secretary of state confirm whether the change she be announce today will be pay for through borrowing or taxation where be these good job she claim to be create when vacancy be go down and unemployment be go up have she read the impact assessment for the government employment rights bill which make it clear that it will be hard for people to find work as result why do it take the government year to publish the term of reference for their pip assessment review and when can we expect change if it do not report back until autumn could try one more time to ask what the difference be between the secretary of state right to try guarantee and our chance to work guarantee finally be this it be there any more saving be the government not go to get any more people into work be this the extent of their ambition for reform the welfare system during their time in office in five year time will this be the secretary of state legacy be in listen mode and listen carefully to what the hon lady say once again her strategy seem to be to rail against the problem that she and her party create she have some chutzpah to talk about two tier system when that be precisely what the conservatives introduce when they protect people on legacy benefit when they move on to uc and replace dla with pip they be part of that and the hon lady should admit that rather than make those point she say we should bring back face to face reassessment we be do so it be the conservatives who switch they off to be honest be still no clear about what the conservatives policy actually be the hon lady and the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon sir mel stride claim that they have plan to cut billion from the welfare bill in their manifesto but the truth be that it be nothing but vague idea about turn pip into voucher she talk about fit note think the conservatives try to reform they about three or four time but completely fail as have all their other effort the one change the conservatives do propose be to the work capability assessment and their consultation be rule illegal by the court what be beyond doubt be the mess that they leave our welfare state and country in economic inactivity be rise it be come down under labour disability benefit be double with the cost to taxpayer soar we be put in place real reform base on our value fair for those who need support and for taxpayer that be the leadership that this country deserve call the chair of the select committee on work and pensions be grateful to my right hon friend for her statement absolutely agree that we must reform our social security system under the previous government it neither support nor protect disabled people be also very supportive of the principle that the government have set out may query some of the point that the secretary of state have raise however particularly about new pip assessment process under the pip review that my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability will be undertake the secretary of state say that the four point requirement will not apply until november and that the review will report in november but surely the pip review should determine the new process if this be be truly co produce with disabled people and their organisation the review should determine the new process the new point and the new descriptor we should not predetermine it as four point now thank my hon friend for her question and look forward to give evidence to the select committee about our overall proposal the bill bring forward four point requirement for all new pip claim after have be very clear that that will apply only to new claimant we be also committed to the wide review of pip so that it be fit for the future that will include consider the assessment criterion the activity descriptor and associate point to ensure that they properly reflect the impact of disability in today world the review will conclude by autumn and we will then implement as quickly as possible any change arise from it we have to get the right balance here have be long stand champion of co production include when be the shadow minister for social care we have to do that properly but the four point minimum will be in place for new claimant as we look to make change for the future call the liberal democrat spokesperson the prime minister and many ministers have identify that the benefit system be break and its cost be skyrocket but balance the book on the back of the poor be wrong head in the extreme the proposal today be leap into the dark my liberal democrat colleague and be really concerned that they be rush proposal legislation that be rush be often wrong with unintended consequence as the member of parliament for torbay be concern as my liberal democrat colleague be about the disabled and long term sick their child their family and carer there be some root cause our broken nhs and social care system need to be resolve so that support be there for those most in need our access to work scheme be break and need resolve as matter of urgency there be some real challenge so hope that the secretary of state will give some genuine answer what consultation have she undertake with carer what cost shunt for our care and social need system have she identify in the proposal finally will she consider withdraw these proposal so that there be adequate consultation and scrutiny to avoid any bystander be hit know that the hon gentleman care passionately about these issue he raise the urgent need to ensure that our nhs be back on its foot we be begin to make difference with waiting list down for the first time in two year and with million appointment more than double we promise create in our first year the hon gentleman talk about the failing of access to work absolutely agree that be why as part of the green paper we be look to reform it so that it be available to more people in future we care passionately about family carer as say in my statement exist pip claimant will be protect as result of the change announce today as will those carer whose carer allowance be passporte benefit we be also look at the future of social care with the review by louise casey we be bring these change forward because we do not think it acceptable that the uk have one of the wide disability employment gap in western europe at which be much high than germany france and sweden we think that be unacceptable and we want to change it that be why we be make these reform rise order can we try to speed up question and answer no it be not the secretary of state fault be just think of the number everybody want to make comment and understand why johanna baxter will give we good example welcome my right hon friend statement the additional million for employment support and that the pip review will be co produce with disabled people and their representative but many of my constituent be rely on the scottish government for employment support and for get waiting list down to help they back into work will she outline what discussion she be have with the scottish government to address those concern our new job and career service apply in all part of the uk include scotland to help get more people back into work with personalised support the spending review have deliver an additional billion for scotland it be the big ever settlement in the history of devolution hope that the snp match our ambition to get more people into good work instead of cut the employability budget as it have do in recent year think that the vast majority of people in this country believe in welfare system that be compassionate to the vulnerable and particularly to the disabled but they can no long understand why so many people here in contrast to other similar country be in this situation where they be not work it because you be in power for year yes we be in power for year and during covid when be minister we make decision such as stop face to face assessment because we could not do they we all recognise that the recovery from that covid time have not go as well as it should but if the secretary of state can not deliver shift in the number the economy will be in death spiral she need to recognise that these change need to be reset radically to meet the country expectation absolutely believe that we have to reset the system we have to make sure that everybody who can work get the opportunity to do so and the support they need that be precisely what we be try to do with these plan gently say to the right hon gentleman who admire that it be precisely that failure and that mess that we be now try to tackle thank the secretary of state for the movement make in the last week it would have be good to have have those conversation early but we be where we be in response to the chair of the work and pensions committee my right hon friend speak about the november deadline and the four point kick in will she explain to the house the rationale for settle on those four point in one category prior to the timms review our objective here be as it always have be and be grateful to my hon friend and other for all their engagement with we we be make these change because we have to both get more people who can work into work and try to begin to focus this really important benefit on those with high need so that it be sustainable for the future that will not affect exist pip claimant who will have their income protect that be very positive change that we be make the timms review will look at those descriptor and the point that be allocate as part of much wide assessment because we have to ensure that this benefit last for the future so that it be always there for those in great need the secretary of state tell we that this week turn will cost million year by will she tell the house how she propose to cover that expense this change will be fully fund and that will be set out in the normal way at the next fiscal event as be sure all hon member will appreciate welcome progress but can not countenance sick and disabled people be deny support to enable they to be independent in the future and people be push into deep poverty nor can disabled people across our country support these measure it be matter of conscience will the secretary of state set out why we be vote on these matter tomorrow when the timms review mean that there could be real change to the criterion use in assessment for people to score four point it feel like sign blank cheque know my hon friend care passionately about these issue but no exist claimant will be put into poverty as result of the change in the bill the figure that she be give be about notional future claimant and they take into account none of the record level of employment support that we be put into the system we have publish very clear evidence that proper support programme can get sick and disabled people into work and to stay in work make sure that they can improve their income and their life we have absolutely commit to co produce the timms review indeed we will be work very closely with disabled people on our reform to access to work and how we ensure that the pathway to work investment get the good result for disabled people and their family that work will take time but we will implement the decision as soon as possible my constituent steve have be fit active work person until about year ago since then he have be debilitate by which have leave he able to get out of the house for only about an hour every fortnight even get dress leave he need lie down pip be already difficult for people like steve to access he tell that he would rather have lose both his leg than have get could the secretary of state tell steve why if he have get me two to three year later he almost certainly would not have be eligible for any pip at all be deeply concerned to hear about what the hon lady constituent have be through have many constituent myself who have real need but have struggle to get pip we absolutely want to make sure that the whole assessment process work as effectively as possible urge she and her constituent to feed into the timms review once again exist claimant like her constituent will not lose their income as result of the change in the bill it be very common throughout the benefit system to have exist claimant protect on old rule and old rate that be what we be do today welcome the word of the secretary of state that recognise the need to enable disabled people to fulfil their potential since april have engage with the government make it clear that could not support the proposal on pip our manifesto commit to champion the right of disabled people and the principle of work with disabled people have no public consultation on these plan exclude the voice of disabled people this be not just about process this make disabled people bad off the principle of fairness mean that disabled people have legitimate expectation to be consult in order to fulfil the public sector equality duty under section of the equality act why do the department for work and pensions choose not to consult with disabled people on the pip proposal and what work will it do to win back the trust of disabled people my hon friend be powerful voice and know she will always remain so in this house we be absolutely committed to co produce this pip review lead by the minister for social security and disability she may know that we be also set up collaboration committee on access to work and pathway to make sure that we really get this right look forward to meet she and many other disabled people and their organisation to make sure that we get this right as we go forward to describe it as fair and equal to treat people with identical condition differently purely on the basis of whether they be an exist recipient of benefit be orwellian newspeak on stilt be it so why do the conservative party do it for year thank the secretary of state for her statement will the timms review have the power to review the plan budget saving for future claimant of pip and universal credit health component also if claimant request reassessment because of worsen health condition will they be assess on the current criterion or the new eligibility criterion the pip review be not drive by an objective of make saving it be about make sure that this vital benefit be fair and fit for the future as be the case now people can request reassessment whenever they want exist claimant will remain under the current rule unless they request reassessment until november from then onwards there will be that four point minimum if this be what labour think people vote for and what people want when they vote in july last year why be it not in the labour manifesto why do labour not put in its manifesto that it be go to cut the winter fuel payment keep the two child cap and push more disabled people into poverty be it perhaps because the secretary of state realise how deeply unpopular and wrong these change would be do not expect the hon member to have read every line of our manifesto but reform the benefit system be in it so too be our commitment to tackle child poverty and be beyond proud that the chancellor invest the resource we need to extend free school meal to all family on universal credit and lift child out of poverty that be down payment on our child poverty strategy this autumn call the chair of the women and equalities committee we all agree that the welfare system need reform but many of we in this place believe that change to disability support should not take place without listen to disabled people voice and experience over the last few day have be hopeful that the government have show strength in listen and move on what they have hear however have question on sequence what be the logic of make change for future claimant before finish the timms review which be now to be co produce with disabled people could this lead to not just two tier but three exist claimant new claimant who will lose out and post timms review claimant no that be not correct as set out in my statement exist claimant on pip will be protect the reason we be make the change for future claimant be that we want to start to focus that for future claimant on those with high need for current claimant of both pip and the universal credit health top up no one will be push into poverty as result of the change in the bill health and sickness benefit spending be set to hit billion by the end of the parliament so why be the secretary of state not bring forward proper reform rather than these rush cut impose by the chancellor that save only billion and that duck the difficult decision to deal with the scale of the challenge that we face perhaps the hon member should make that point to those on his front bench who have year welcome the clarity that my right hon friend have set out particularly for exist pip claimant and those with severe condition but my constituent who meet this weekend want to have an active part in design the change that affect they can she confirm that my constituent will be able to feed their direct live experience into the pip review yes as set out my statement we intend to co produce the timms review with disabled people the organisation that represent they other expert and mp so my hon friend constituent will absolutely be able to feed their view into the review we want to strike the right balance here because co production take time we want to do it as quickly as possible but it have to be do as effectively as possible look forward to work with my hon friend and involve her constituent view speak to resident friend in my constituency over the weekend she be wheelchair user since fail back operation some year ago she currently get pip she get three point for dressing and undressing and two point for washing and bathing she need help with both yet she fear as do that anybody with her exact need apply after next november will be leave without help we be right be we not to be concern and to fear that that be unjust and uncaring be it repeat to the hon gentleman that it be common through the benefit system to protect exist claimant from new rule and rate also say to he that we be put billion of pound extra into the nhs so people can get the health and social care support they need we be put in place the big ever employment support investment for sick and disabled people because we know disabled people who be out of work be twice as likely to be in poverty that be the investment we be make his constituent will be protect and will not be put into poverty as result of the change in this bill thank the secretary of state for her commitment to bring forward strong bill work with colleague across the house the reality be that any one of we in this house could become disabled disability do not discriminate it be important for we to recognise the network of informal care that keep our social care system go the reality be that number of carer would not be eligible for carer allowance without the pip eligibility and so many carer who receive carer allowance be in poverty those people do not do it for the money they do it because they want to help love one or family friend know from personal experience be carer for my mum the toll it take when you help someone to bathe to get out of bed or to cook and clean these people do not do it for the money but they be scared can the secretary of state confirm that we will protect those carer in any future pip change because it be right that those carer should not be push far into poverty my hon friend be huge champion of these issue and have long champion what unpaid family carer do as she say many do not even think they be carer they be just husband wife son daughter mum or dad look after the person they love want to reassure she as say in my statement that exist pip claimant and all those who get passporte benefit like carer will be protect as result of the change we have make indeed know my right hon friend the health secretary want to do far more to support family carer in future because without they our nhs would collapse do the secretary of state agree that while necessary at the time of covid the removal of the requirement for face to face assessment be an opening of the door to potential abuse if so will she commit in principle to the reinstatement of face to face assessment that be exactly what we commit to in our green paper presumably the outcome of the timms review will require some form of primary legislation to enact the change to the system that will come from the department for work and pensions in which case suggest to the minister that remove clause from the bill tomorrow and put it into any future legislation mean the department can still have its threshold in the future if it want to but only once everybody know against what criterion those judgment will be make we be co produce this review and it may result in change that require primary or secondary legislation or other action and do not want to pre empt that let just bring my hon friend and the house back to the purpose of these change to ensure that we have system that be fair for those who need support and fair for taxpayer and to try to put the welfare state on more sustainable footing for the future if we do not do so my real fear be that it will not be there for the very people who really really need support go forward today statement feel like panicked political fix to an indefensible attempt to cut benefit from the most sick and from disabled people but it lack competence and compassion give that the secretary of state talk about social justice how can she justify people who might need that support in the future not receive the support that disabled and sick people rightly receive today would the right thing to do not be to shelve these proposal so she can allow time to do what she have promise to do and to genuinely co produce and consult with disabled people on the right way forward fundamentally disagree with the hon gentleman proposition our change be root in the clear principle that those who can work should work and need the support to do so and those who can not work should be protect but that we need system that be fair and sustainable do not believe that we can wait while disabled people in this country who want to work be deny the opportunity to do so we can not have system where one in eight young people be not in education employment or training with all the terrible long term consequence that bring we can not see one in of our fellow citizen trap out of work and economically inactive because that be not good future for they or for our country we already know that the bill as publish be flawed because of the change that have be make in the past few day and announce today welcome the wide review of pip and the consultation with disabled people their organisation and clinician but give the wide review and that the timms review be yet to report why be we push ahead at this stage because we have to begin to reform the welfare state to help those who can work to do so to protect those who can not and to begin to put our welfare state on more sustainable footing the bill protect exist claimant they will not be affect by the change it ensure that people have right to try and that those with severe lifelong condition never face reassessment it come alongside the big ever employment support for sick and disabled people together this be fair and balanced package that meet the need of exist claimant and reform the welfare state for the future there be almost million few workless household in than in one factor behind that be universal credit and reduce the barrier and perceive risk of go back into work if people be not sure how it would work out notwithstanding the right to try if there be to be two different level of health component outside the severe condition criterion will that not raise those barrier back up and do the exact opposite of the right hon lady state intent fundamentally disagree with the right hon gentleman for whom have great respect actually think that universal credit sometimes lock people out of work because they have to define themselves as incapable of work in order to afford to live less than of people on uc move into work each month that be not good enough for they their income and their life chance and it be not good enough for the taxpayer either thank the secretary of state and her colleague in the department for their tireless work over the past week and very much welcome her commitment to co production with disabled people in the timms review the atrocious handling of the pandemic by the previous conservative government have leave the economy and disabled people pay the cost will the secretary of state confirm whether the timms review funding model will have the fiscal baseline of the inherit four point system if that be the case how can that mean meaningful co production with disabled people agree with my hon friend comment about the state of the economy as say in my statement the four point minimum will now not relate to exist claimant it will come in for new claim in november but the timms review and the co production will look not only at the activity and the descriptor but the point give to they it be important that we do not set up process of co production and then overrule that we want benefit system that enable disabled people to have dignity and independence and the same choice and chance to live the life that they want as anybody else have it be really important process and hope that she and many other hon member in the house will work with we to get this right recently meet support group in my constituency of those who suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid their description of the devastating impact of those variable condition be very affect if one of those people be to have an improvement in their condition mean that they be no long eligible for pip and then to re present for assessment would they be entitle to return to the pip level they be on previously or would they be treat as new applicant under the term the secretary of state have describe today the hon gentleman raise an important point which be precisely what we want to look at in the pip review because it do not take into account fluctuating condition that be an important issue move forward and we will be absolutely determined to involve he his constituent and organisation that represent those with fluctuate condition in the process of the report july vol correction be grateful to my colleague on the front bench for listen to what back bencher have be say for month and for make so many change however do not see any change that affect young people particularly care experienced young people will the secretary of state cast some light on what discussion be ongoing with young people about the process involve they thank my hon friend for her question as part of the process of the green paper we be establish youth panel to ensure that young people voice be hear in our future reform many of the youth guarantee trailblazer that we be put in place as part of our million get britain working plan be look to provide extra support for young care leaver because they be in different circumstance and need extra help be sure there be far more that we could be do in future and urge she to work with we to ensure that their view be at the heart of our plan many on the dup benches want to support the government in achieve the objective of get people back to work and be fair to those who can not work but do the secretary of state realise how difficult her action make it for we to give support last week the deputy prime minister stand at the dispatch box and say these proposal will go before parliament this week they fair and if they do go there be black hole in the economy that we can not fill this week we be now tell actually lot of people be vulnerable and it not fair and they rely on the income and we will find the money the only thing that have change in the week be that back benchers sign letter that would not support the proposal do the secretary of state realise how cynical that appear this be not about well think out proposal but simply way of buy back the back benchers who be rebel it might astonish the house that think leadership be about stick to our principle and value and listen to ensure that we get thing right believe that listening be strength not weakness and believe that in politic as well as in life do the secretary of state agree that our welfare system must do much more to support and reward work and also support people who be look to re enter or enter work what difference do she believe that the right to try guarantee will make in achieve that labour historic mission be to help more people who can work into good job in every part of the land that be not only because we believe that be key to improve living standard but because of the self respect dignity and purpose that good work bring the right to try be an important step we know that around of sick and disabled people say that the reason they be not try work be because they fear they will be reassess for their benefit we have get to put that right we have also get to put in place the employment support we have to create good job in every part of the country and get those waiting list down so that people can get back to health and back to work we be take action on all those front and look forward to work with my hon friend in his constituency so that more of his constituent can benefit it seem entirely reasonable that government should want to control the amount that they spend on welfare and entirely reasonable to want to focus that on the most in need however do not understand why they bring out such rush change which have do nothing but cause anxiety and distress and leave they in bad position in which they have now turn and be neither make saving nor reform welfare will the secretary of state please explain the rationale for the four point limit that she bring in for new claimant it be because we believe that we need to begin to focus this vital disability benefit on those with high need be deeply concerned that doubling in the number of people on pip over this decade from million to million with claim and award rise at twice the rate of the increase in the number of disabled people in society risk the sustainability of the system in future we have to ensure that it be there for those who really need it provide that vital safety net go forward the hon lady talk about have reasonable approach and really do believe that this be reasonable believe that protect exist claimant and begin to make change for future claimant back by the change to the right to try stop reassessment and invest in real employment support be the fair and right balance for the people who need support and for taxpayer thank the minister for her statement and for her engagement my question be about the co production proposal by what mechanism will that be give effect and how be co production different from consultation will disability group have any entitlement or power beyond simply give their view we be not set out the precise detail of how co production work think that would go against the very essence of it we be already in discussion with disabled people and their organisation on our green paper we have already set out what we call collaboration committee reform to access to work our pathway to work and investment in employment support because we want to get this right we look forward to those discussion to ensure that people have proper say and be fully engage and involve because we want to make sure that we get this right in her statement the secretary of state recognise that exist claimant rely on the income from pip for so many different aspect of their life one aspect for many be work why do she think that new claimant will not have the same need and what aspect of their life do she think they should curtail the hon lady raise really important point access to work be there precisely to support people who have need over and above the legal requirement on employer to make reasonable adjustment we need to fix that system because the backlog be too long and not enough people be get that support that be precisely why we be consult on the future of access to work we will make the change that people need so that they can get the help they need to get good meaningful work and to stay in work and we will deliver that as soon as possible despite the change be it not the case that over disabled people our constituent who need assistance to cut up their food wash themselves go to the toilet and dress themselves will be deny pip from next year when they currently would have get it be not the reality that labour mp will have to deal with that week after week in their constituency surgery would it not be well if rather than try to save political face the government pull this artificial politically impose deadline of tomorrow it be important not that we save face but that we get it right many hon member have understandably raise concern because their constituent who be on pip right here and now be extremely anxious even though if they be still on pip at the time when the change come in nine out of of they will not be affect they will be protect in future the timms review will look at this vital benefit go forward the activity the descriptor and the point they get and really hope that my hon friend will engage with we throughout the process to ensure that we get it right the uk government amendment to the universal credit and personal independence payment bill be not include in the initial statement on the bill compatibility with the european convention on human right discrimination be real concern give that two people with the same condition could receive different support base on when they become sick or turn will the secretary of state make an update statement on compatibility and confirm that her department have comply with the public sector equality duty under the equality act can indeed confirm that we have comply with all our legal requirement do not doubt the secretary of state commitment to get this right she will be very aware that as it stand the legal advice we have have be that these proposal will breach our obligation under the un convention on the right of person with disability the previous government do that and we rightly challenge they on it so that we do not make the same mistake will she give commitment to write into bill that these proposal will be compliant with that commitment to ensure that person with disability have social protection and the enjoyment of that right without discrimination on the basis of their disability simply say to my hon friend who know that have deep respect for she that would not be make any change that believe be incompatible with the law be sure that the chancellor will be delighted that the flip flopping of the prime minister mean she have to find another billion in taxation on people in this country do the secretary of state think that it be fair that two tier system have be create why would anybody on the old rate seek work when they know that if they go into work it do not work out and they claim again they will get reduce rate under her government because pip be not an in work report july vol correction the north east have the high rate of disability in the more than quarter of those of work age live in poverty so the secretary of state be absolutely right to say that welfare reform be hard essential and must reflect labour value and disabled voice will she set out how the co production of the new system with disability group will ensure that it be fair system how will disability group in the north east be able to be involve we will absolutely ensure that the view and voice of disabled people right across the country include in the north east be fully involve in our process of co production my hon friend be powerful champion of that and hope that she too will get involve with our plan the minister for social security and disability my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms will develop the process of co production in close conduct with disabled people and their organisation and be sure that he will update the house shortly as those plan progress on page of her statement the secretary of state ask herself rhetorical question about two tier system somebody who be now eligible for personal independence payment get it but can she simply confirm that somebody who suffer the same kind of condition whenever this bill become law will not be eligible for the personal independence payment their support will be from friend or family or they will have no support at all be she really happy that we be deliberately create two tier system for people with profound need and disability who quite rightly expect the community as whole to recognise and support they simply say to the right hon gentleman that there be many difference in the benefit system already people be on different rate and have different rule depend on the time they come into the system that have always be part of the social security system include under previous labour government the timms review will look at the different descriptor and the point that be deliver to they alongside much wide change pip come in more than year ago and there have be huge change in the nature of disability the world of work and society we have to ensure that this vital benefit stay in future and that be what the timms review seek to achieve think it would be helpful to let member know that plan to allow this statement to continue until pm it would therefore be helpful if question be short over recent month have consult with constituent who have live experience of disability and the welfare system and their representative know that they will welcome the secretary of state statement that protection for exist claimant will be protect but one of the most heartbreaking story hear in those consultation be about young constituent who apply for hundred of job and attend dozen of interview and simply could not find job will the secretary of state meet to discuss what more we can do not just to support disabled people in my constituency but to encourage employer to take on some of the talented brilliant people live with disability in my constituency my hon friend raise really important issue which be the world of work and the need to ensure that employer recruit and retain more people with long term sickness or disability that be precisely why in addition to the huge advance in our employment rights bill we have ask sir charlie mayfield the former boss of john lewis to look at what more we can do to support employer to recruit and retain disabled people we be also overhaul our jobcentre so that they provide more personalised tailor support indeed we have set our jobcentre new goal of reduce the disability employment gap which believe will also make huge difference call cameron thomas welcome back madam deputy speaker the government recent compromise with their own mps secure pip for exist claimant but not for those who come hereafter distinction bear not of compassion nor apparently of economic but to secure the government own political footing if be wrong will the secretary of state describe the moral foundation for this distinction between those who suffer today and those who will suffer in the future be not go to take any lecture on compassion have fight my whole life to tackle poverty and drive up opportunity for people no matter where they be bear what their parent do their gender their sexuality or the colour of their skin the social security system have many different rule for new and previous claimant do not believe that be an unfair system believe it be the way in which we protect people who have come to rely on benefit be proud of the change we have announce today think they be positive and get we to good place listen be sign of strength and be absolutely determined to continue to listen thank my right hon friend for her statement and for the step she have take to improve the bill in launch the timms review she have accept that the current pip assessment criterion and descriptor be not fit for purpose can she confirm that the difference between the timetable for implement the change that will require applicant to achieve four point in single category and the timetable for complete and implement the timms review will result in some people fall between the old system and the new one they will be require to achieve four point on criterion that be not fit for purpose for how long will that happen who will be affect and what will happen to those people in future know that my hon friend have work extremely hard on all of those issue that question be raise previously by another colleague and the answer be that there will be two set the people who be on the exist system who will be protect and those who will be on the four point as we go forward however the timms review will indeed look at the descriptor and the different point that they get those change will come in as soon as possible the review will report by autumn and we will try to put the change in place as quickly as possible we do not yet know what the review will say or how those change will be enact but we be determined to ensure that they be put in place as soon as possible be the problem for the government not the failure of the prime minister to even seek mandate for what he be try to do he say that he would limit spending increase to billion year but he have increase spending by eight time as much and the effect on the fiscal rule be the root cause of this problem he also win the labour leadership by promise to abolish universal credit and end the tories cruel sanction regime but then he masquerade as welfare reformer do the secretary of state now realise that to win mandate one need to be straight with people include one own mps be very proud of our prime minister who change our party so that we can change our country and the mandate can be see by the number of mps on the benches behind increase access to employment opportunity for disabled people and improve the retention of disabled worker be urgent before and they be even more urgent now my right hon friend do not mention the mayfield review although she have just mention it in response to question can please push she on that review first can she expedite it secondly can it include disabled people more meaningfully than it have until now and thirdly will it indicate how the government will implement our manifesto commitment to increase access to reasonable adjustment the mayfield review will be report before the budget sir charlie mayfield want to work closely with disabled people and the organisation that represent they he have see inspire example of what good employer be do and good thing that other country be do and that will provide some insightful lesson the minister for social security and disability have already say that we be look at whether we should put in place timeframe within which employer need to respond to request for reasonable adjustment we want to make sure that those adjustment be make as quickly as possible so that more disabled people can get work and stay in work why be the propose pip cut still be apply to new claimant many of whose need be as urgent and severe as those of exist claimant the reason we be protect exist claimant and begin to focus pip on those with high need in future be because we want system that be sustainable and last do not believe it be sustainable to have doubling of the number of pip claim every decade add people day the rate be rise fast than the increase in prevalence of disabled people in this country the truth be that the part of the country that have the high disability benefit claim and incapacity benefit claim be the place that be decimate by the tories in the and when whole industry close those place be yet to have the investment they need to create job and have not have the investment in the nhs have always believe in the social model of disability we have to put these thing right urgently because disabled people deserve well life than they have under the conservatives thank my right hon friend for her work on this issue and for make the statement today although share hon member concern that make change before review be put the cart before the horse must just press she on this while welcome the change that bring immediate security and protection for exist claimant can she please confirm whether if an exist claimant or someone on legacy benefit be reassess the new measure or the exist one will apply on carer future applicant will face increase eligibility criterion will carer be include in the co production review carry out by the minister for social security and disability absolutely my right hon friend the minister for social security and disability and meet carer organisation and many other disability organisation the day after we publish the green paper want to be crystal clear people who be currently on pip and be on pip by the time these change come in november will remain on that benefit under those old rule in the first line of her statement the secretary of state affirm that this government believe in equality where be the equality in evaluate one person eligibility for the daily living component of pip on the practical consequence of their disability and evaluate another on the date of their application this be really common issue in the benefit system if we could never change it we could not undertake reform to make it sustainable for the future exist claimant will remain on the current rule even if and when they be reassess change will come in for new claimant from november but our review will look as have say many time at the different activity and descriptor and the point that they will get because we need to make sure that this vital benefit be sustainable for the future thank the secretary of state for come this afternoon welcome her announcement that the timms review of the pip process will be undertake in partnership with people with disability that be critical because in more than of appeal pip outcome be overturn in favour of the claimant we need to get the assessment right first time and every time for all applicant do she agree yes decide to go into politic because believe that luck play too great role in shape people course and their quality of life but unfortunately the system that have be announce today leave the fate of many disabled people down to luck to whether they apply before november or after hope that the secretary of state will reverse her decision and drop the bill tomorrow but in case she will not may ask she to commit to engage with kathy disabled person in my constituency who run facebook group of people advise on pip and disability relate matter to ensure that their voice be at the centre of the plan will absolutely commit to ensure that those view and voice be hear and be sure that as strong champion for his constituency the hon gentleman will do so as well however do not believe that this be about luck believe that certain part of the country and different type of people have be repeatedly neglect and deny opportunity and support there be nothing about luck here this be about people and place that have be write off and deny opportunity for too long government if they be determined can make difference and that be what we intend to do have conduct survey of my constituent on the subject of welfare reform and submit the finding to the consultation have also meet disability group across swansea and disabled constituent to hear their concern the problem that have find to be the most prevalent in gower be the incompetence of capita and the inconsistency of department for work and pensions decision maker that be why genuinely welcome the announcement of the timms review but what reassurance can the secretary of state give that the review will address this matter and give people confidence in the decision make process my hon friend should send the detail of those finding and concern one of the reason we be not only bring back face to face assessment but record they as standard be our wish to get to the bottom of this and make sure that we put it right over the weekend have the privilege of engage in number of in depth conversation with people and family live with disability and thank dartford kindness community for arrange that event one comment that hear again and again from the people talk to be about how poor the health service have be at help disabled people to manage their condition over many year how can the dwp and the department of health and social care work together to ensure that disabled people be properly support and help into work my hon friend have make an important point there be far more that the health service can do to help people with long term sickness and disability to manage their condition well because they can not do it on their own they need the right help and support our joint work and health unit be work on precisely those issue and be indeed work closely with my right hon friend the health secretary because get people back to health and back to work be so important we know that good work be critical to good health and good health be critical to people get into work those be two side of the same coin we must end these false divide and get this sort out so that we can help people to fulfil their ambition and work thank the secretary of state for her statement it be vital for we to have social security system that protect the most vulnerable the ill and the disabled so will she clarify one provision in the bill will both the standard element and the health element of universal credit rise in line with inflation if that do not happen disabled people will be push far into poverty and hardship want to make it very clear that the combine rate of the standard allowance and the health top up will indeed rise in line with inflation so that exist claimant be protect in real term and the income of those with severe lifelong condition and those at the end of their life be also protect in real term through the combine universal credit standard allowance top up the bill still leave over billion of cut fall on disabled people and unpaid carer with hundred of thousand of new claimant set to lose thousand of pound each year protection for exist claimant be welcome but two tier system will generate hardship for many and create societal division we be be ask to vote without vital evidence without the office for budget responsibility impact assessment or the timms and mayfield review serious question remain unanswered and we be without clarity on outcome and implementation will the secretary of state continue to listen withdraw this bill and co design welfare reform with disabled people group say to my hon friend for whom have great respect that none of this take into account the big ever investment in employment support for sick and disabled people people have often say wait for the obr assessment but we have publish very clear evidence that good employment programme can help disabled people into work programme such as work choice labour programme end by the tories which see more disabled people in work for eight year that be base not just on economic theory but on practical reality that be the difference that this labour government want to make disabled people organisation have be clear that even with these concession they oppose this bill the government talk of co production of the pip review but it be not co production if the starting point be deliver cut and if the government be ask disabled people where they would prefer those cut to be rather than how we can create system that truly support disabled people do the secretary of state not accept that after month of the government ignore disabled people the only way that meaningful co production can take place be if the bill be pull and they go back to the drawing board gently say to my hon friend that we will protect exist claimant that be the very purpose of the announcement we have make today no exist pip claimant or people receive universal credit and the health top up will be put into poverty as result of this bill far from it we be change the system so that many more sick and disabled people who want to work can actually get work that be about build well life in future this labour government believe that if someone can work and want to work they should have the chance and choice to do so some sick and disabled people say that they would work right now with the right help and support we be not cut the support for that we be actually increase it because we believe that work be the key to well life thank the secretary of state for her statement and for the recent move to protect exist claimant appreciate that the adult disability payment be devolve to the scottish government however my constituent be really concerned about the potential for different qualifying criterion across the nation which may result in limited access to passporte benefit from november what assurance can the secretary of state give my constituent that they will not lose the benefit to which they currently have access and the vital support on which their household rely follow the secretary of state response to my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes it be really unclear whether the house be be ask to agree to four point assessment without know the outcome of the timms review with regard to descriptor or could that review result in more fundamental reform that would rip up the current pip system on my hon friend first point she will know that pip be devolve to scotland believe that the scottish government be review the adp at the minute include the eligibility criterion that will be matter for they but want to be clear to the house that the new four point minimum requirement will come into force in november for new claim and exist claimant will be protect of course the timms review will look at the different descriptor and the point for they in future but the four point minimum and the daily live component for new claimant will remain the conservative party preside over multiple reform of welfare and the result be disaster perhaps cruell of all be the fact that adult who have an irreversible health condition and who could never work be force to go through reassessment after reassessment and to jump through hoop can my right hon friend please confirm that with these labour reform that cruel legacy will be end once and for all yes can believe that the unnecessary and unacceptable stress that that create be not right and we will fix that with the reform in the bill because people need to live in dignity and security the labour party be define by work and by the dignity of work and so be my community in gateshead and whickham people have the belief that they should be able to work to provide for themselves their family and their community but too many in my community have be let down by successive government of all party who have not create the job we need and by fail system not one person who have speak today not one have defend the exist indefensible system what will the secretary of state do to ensure that community like mine where work or lack of work be the problem receive the support we need my hon friend speak powerfully about labour historic mission to help people who can work to do so and about the fact that his constituent have be deny that support for so long we want to transform that with an age society in which more of we will be live with disability or with one two or more long term chronic condition and in which we will be care for people we believe that we have to change the welfare state we have to provide more support to help people work and the world of work need to change that be why not only have we commission the mayfield review but we be put in the big ever employment support for sick and disabled people with the additional million of support have announce today rise order encourage member to keep their question short or they will not all get in have meet disabled constituent over the last few month have no doubt that the initial proposal cause anxiety so do welcome the change for exist claimant and the timms review however can urge the secretary of state to look at the sequencing to make sure that the review happen before we assess new claimant have one final point about the assessor themselves there be no doubt but that the involvement of private company such as capita and maximus have cause problem as have have assessor who do not understand health condition can we make sure that we look at that properly yes we be absolutely committed to look at that in fact we announce in the green paper that we be overhaul our entire safeguarding process include the training of assessor because we want to get this right we will not only bring back face to face assessment but record they as standard which believe together will make real difference to the process and ensure we get the decision right first time these so call concession go nowhere near far enough and tomorrow will be vote against these cruel cut but want to ask this can the secretary of state name single disabled person lead organisation that support this legislation understand why disability organisation be make the point they be that be their job our job be different our job be to take the right decision one that we believe be fair to make sure we have system that work for the people who need support but that be also sustainable for the future that be not easy that be statement of the obvious but believe we have fair package it be package that protect exist claimant because they have come to rely on that support as be often the case in the social security system it begin to tackle the perverse incentive that encourage people to define themselves as incapable of work just to be able to afford to live and it put in place employment support to help the hundred of thousand of disabled people and people with long term condition who want to work that be the right way forward and hope that my hon friend and his constituent will get involve in the timms review to ensure future change make this vital benefit fit for the future last week speak to one of my constituent mike disabled person who speak on behalf of many disabled constituent across warwickshire he be really pleased that he will have the right to try work and he be also really pleased that disabled people will be treat with dignity and will be part of the co production of the new proposal however he be still fearful that these change may mean loss and difficult situation for disabled people like he can the secretary of state reassure mike that one of her ministers will meet he to discuss these change in particular how will we look at fluctuate condition such as me and ms which my partner suffer from so that such people do not lose out and so that we make the change positive for every disabled person up and down the country we want to work with mps disabled people their organisation and other expert as part of co produce the timms review the point about fluctuate health condition be really important and something we have to crack for the future because so many people have those condition they may be able to work one day and not another or to work three day at home but not five day we must make it fit for the future because the reality be that we be live long more of we have disability and more of we have two three or more long term condition the welfare state in its broad sense the nhs as well as the benefit system and the world of work have to wake up to that as we live long we will have to work for long but we have to make that practical and decent this be relatively small bill but one core part of it have now be delegate to the pip review and that will not report until november can my right hon friend say just how many disabled group have indicate they want to participate in the pip review she have set out number of red line today that doubt they would agree with if they be to propose that we do not have two tier system what would be the government response the minister for social security and disability and have meet many disabled organisation in fact he have speak to many already about the review we will continue to discuss with they precisely how the system of co production will work but want to assure my hon friend that it be serious we want to make sure people view and voice be hear and encourage he as member of parliament to get involve in the process too as signatory to the reason amendment welcome the listening that have go on because lot of people with disability will sleep more soundly in their bed know that their benefit be protect however on specific point if someone currently receive pip but their condition be get bad and they ask for reassessment of the level of their pip will they be assess under the current system or under the new one they be an exist claimant and they will be assess let be really clear about this under the exist rule thank the secretary of state for her statement pip be of course passport to freedom for many other thing such as the carer allowance and many local authority use pip for blue badge and bus pass do the secretary of state have plan to mitigate the impact of the potential change to pip eligibility on access to blue badge and bus pass for disabled people as say in my statement exist pip claimant will continue to have that benefit it will not be affect even if they have reassessment and neither will all the passporte benefit carer allowance be the well know but all passporte benefit will be include in that protection this morning meet parkinson uk which be very concerned about the change to both pip and universal credit and in particular that they will not take account of those with variable condition will the secretary of state make commitment that parkinson uk will be involve in the co design of the change to pip universal credit and other welfare benefit and that any welfare change will fully consider those with parkinson and other variable condition be absolutely sure that parkinson uk will be involve closely in the pip review two week ago hold an in person consultation on the welfare reform many of my constituent be deeply concerned about the proposal so welcome the change the secretary of state have announce for exist claimant want to ask about employment support welcome the additional support be bring forward when will we get more detail on how that will be allocate to scheme across the country and will the people who need it most be involve in the co production of those scheme so that they work effectively yes we already have what we be call collaboration committee on the pathway to work funding to ensure that it really meet the need of sick and disabled people as have say in the house before it really be about pathway to work for some people just get out of the house or get out of bed be huge achievement for other it might be about go along to group begin to speak to other people and get their confidence back it really be pathway to success we will be set out precise allocation of the pathway to work funding in due course but want to reassure member that it will be available in every single part of the country grow up care for two disabled parent as kid see at first hand the harm that happen when the british state routinely let down disabled people it be why disabled civil right activist have phrase nothing about we without we and it be why be look for genuine and meaningful co production on friday bring together seven bournemouth support organisation and people with live experience and they want to raise two issue the first be continue concern about the eligibility criterion the second be whether the mental health support that the government be roll out will be in place in sufficient quantity to support potential new claimant by november my hon friend raise an important point about mental health support this government be determined to ensure that there be parity of esteem between physical and mental health we have already recruit of the additional mental health worker we promise in our manifesto and we be put in place new emergency mental health service and bring in new young futures hub which will include mental health support know that my right hon friend the health secretary be determined to ensure that that support be available in every part of the country be sure we will hear more in the come week and month thank the secretary of state for acknowledge at the dispatch box the anxiety of disabled people be also grateful for the time of the disability minister in listen to my concern about the pip assessment process concern that now see reflect in the timms review be sure the secretary of state will be disappoint to hear that at recent consultation event in the north east some of my constituent find that the venue be not fully disability compliant will she assure that the government will ensure full accessibility for participation in the timms review that be unacceptable and will sort it thank the secretary of state for her statement wonder if she will reflect on whether the bill before we tomorrow be the good way of make welfare policy would it not be well to withdraw the bill and wait for the timms review to complete its important work welfare touch on the life of million of people in this country every single day make change to it be never easy perhaps particularly for labour government because tackle poverty and inequality be in our dna however believe that we must begin to make these change to ensure that those who can work get the support they need to protect those who can not and to begin to slow the rate of increase in the number of extra people go on to sickness and disability benefit believe that the route to equality and social justice can never come from extra benefit spending alone it have to come from put in place good job decent health service skill and transport infrastructure the good world of work that we know be key to bring about well life it be clear that the central issue for many on the government benches remain rush through legislation without full and meaningful consultation with disability group be the wrong way round we do not build policy first and ask question later the government arbitrary deadline be not necessity but political choice they be force through decision that risk push hundred of thousand more disabled people into poverty therefore say to the secretary of state with absolute sincerity on behalf of many member do the fair thing and more importantly the right thing and withdraw this bill and listen to disabled people believe that we be do the fair thing and the right thing we be begin to make reform to put our welfare bill on sustainable footing for generation to come we be begin to put in place the employment support that sick and disabled people have be deny for too long we be make sure that those with severe and lifelong condition be never again reassess and that there be new right to try believe that this be fair and balanced package above all believe that it be the right one welcome my right hon friend statement and the government work to ensure that help be there for those who need it now and in future many in this house will be worry that progress on close the disability employment gap stall under the conservative party at percentage point will the secretary of state confirm that that be one of the metric that the government be focus on in the strategy and that the gap must and will close under this government we be absolutely determined to achieve that do not believe that it be acceptable that in this country the disability employment gap be percentage point that be one of the wide in all europe in france germany and switzerland think it be at about to percentage point we have to tackle that because if we believe that the right of disabled people who can work be equal to those of anybody else we have to start make difference know that this be an issue of deep concern for many member across the house but believe that the package we be put forward today be fair one and be the right one will continue to listen to member of this house but we can not wait to reform the welfare system people need we to make change and our country demand it thank the secretary of state for listen to the concern of back benchers and for make some real and meaningful improvement base on the concern that we have be raise privately also thank she for confirm explicitly moment ago that my constituent who be reassess post november will be reassess under the current system may gently encourage the secretary of state to go far and to overhaul and radically rethink the role of jobcentre far too often they hold people back rather than break down the barrier to people progress into work our minister for employment be indeed overhaul our jobcentre so that they provide personalised tailor support for people to get into work not some sort of endless tick box process and so that they be much more link to the wide system in local area to the local nhs to skill provider and above all to employer do not think it acceptable that only one employer in six have ever use jobcentre to recruit that be why we be overhaul our strategy with single account manager for employer to fully involve and engage they because we need their involvement if we be to help more people to get work and get on in work rise order for the final question call sarah coombe my borough sandwell have one of the high rate in the entire country of young people not in education employment or training this generation of young people have be let down by year and year of system failure by the conservative party as we go through this necessary piece of reform we must do it carefully will the secretary of state commit to work with the department for education and the department for business and trade for young people to get the job that will transform their life chance they will need the right qualification as well as need the job to be available absolutely agree let we be honest today economy be brutal for people without skill we be already set out our plan to reform the system of apprenticeship we want to see new foundation apprenticeship we be bring in new six week swap sector base work academy programme that will give people guarantee work experience and guarantee interview which think will make real difference to young people there be much more to do but our commitment to youth guarantee so that every young person be earn or learning be the key to well future for young people and for our country as whole glastonbury festival bbc coverage with permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement about the event at glastonbury over the weekend member of parliament will have see as have the appalling and unacceptable scene at glastonbury on saturday where chant of death to the idf and river to the sea among other be broadcast to the nation have be in touch with my right hon friend the home secretary as to whether there have be any criminal offence commit the house will know that decision relate to specific case be an operational matter for the police avon and somerset police have confirm that video evidence be be assess by officer to determine whether any offence may have be commit it just announce in the last few minute that that be now take the form of criminal investigation as hope hon member will appreciate therefore it would not be appropriate for the government to comment on an ongoing investigation at this stage but let be clear that the government will not tolerate antisemitism which have no place in our society it be poison and cancer that must be root out and we will be relentless in our work to do so the government work closely with the police and community partner to ensure the safety and security of jewish community we will continue to do so follow the enormous impact that these event have have on they over the weekend let turn to the role of the bbc on saturday afternoon just after the broadcast call the director general to ask for an explanation and what immediate step the bbc leadership intend to take as the prime minister say yesterday it be essential that the bbc explain how these scene come to be broadcast the bbc have rightly apologise and take the immediate decision not to put this content on iplayer welcome that however key outstanding question remain include why the performance be broadcast live give concern regard other act in the week precede the festival why the feed be not immediately cut when the chant of death to the idf begin and what due diligence be do prior to the decision to broadcast this particular act to the nation expect answer to those question without delay have make that view clear to the bbc leadership and will update the house as soon as can over the weekend and this morning have also have conversation with member of the jewish community include those who be present at glastonbury they have raise number of concern about imagery and slogan that be on display at the festival over the weekend which be tell lead they to establish their own safe space at the festival as government we take that incredibly seriously we be urgently look into the specific of those alarming report and reach out to the festival organiser finally want to be clear about the government role as government we strongly support freedom of expression and as culture secretary will robustly defend the independence of our broadcaster and the right to artistic expression but we do not accept that incitement to violence hate speech or antisemitism be art there be clear difference between speak out for palestine which be the right of everybody in this house and everybody in our country and antisemitism which be not and never will be when the right and safety of people and community be at risk and when our national broadcaster fail to uphold its own standard we will intervene in the come day will be have further conversation with the bbc and festival organiser to ensure that lesson be learn and action be take call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for her statement for advance sight of it and for her tone have always be strong advocate for the bbc which be cornerstone of british public life with proud history of cultural contribution the event of the weekend however have make that incredibly difficult during coverage of the festival as we have hear the artist whose real name be pascal robinson foster lead the crowd in chant of death to the idf moment that extraordinarily be transmit by the bbc let be clear national broadcaster fund by licence payer must adhere to the high standard of impartiality responsibility and commitment to social cohesion hope we can all agree that in this instance it have fail profoundly free speech and political activism be the sign of healthy democracy they be essential to it but when someone cross the line to incitement to violence there must be consequence broadcasting be not passive act every second of broadcast transmit be an active choice air robinson foster hateful rhetoric be not just lapse in editorial judgment it be disgraceful affront to the jewish community and violation of the bbc own public charter to entertain without undermine the fundamental value of our society as the secretary of state say let we be clear that hateful rhetoric should never be cloak as artistic expression this incident also raise fundamental question about the bbc institutional culture this be broadcaster that have time and again give airtime to representative and supporter of hamas while refuse to clearly identify the group as what it be terrorist organisation the bbc have repeatedly fail to call out antisemitic rhetoric when it emerge under the guise of political commentary and have face serious allegation of minimise attack on jewish community the bbc decision to also broadcast material from kneecap group whose member have openly call for members of parliament to be kill be as indefensible as it be shocking we have already see the devastating consequence of political violence in this country with the loss and tragic murder of jo cox and sir david amess for the bbc to amplify voice advocate similar violence be grossly irresponsible even more troubling be that lead member of the group be currently face terrorism charge that fact alone should have prompt an immediate editorial intervention instead the bbc give the group platform on publicly fund service welcome the fact that the secretary of state have speak to the director general and be grateful to she for come to the house to report on that exchange however would like to press she far to ensure that the gravity of this matter be fully recognise be she satisfied with the bbc explanation that it originally decide that stream the performance be in line with its editorial guideline and have now decide that we will look at our guidance around live event so we can be sure team be clear on when it be acceptable to keep output on air do she think that the bbc editorial guideline be not clear enough or that the bbc misinterpret they in the first place and do she think that that sort of weak response will be of cold comfort to the jewish community welcome the fact that the secretary of state have speak to the home secretary wonder whether she could also assess whether the bbc action constitute breach of section of the public order act do she believe that the bbc current editorial oversight mechanism be adequate specifically across the commercial broadcasting arm like bbc studios and do she think that it be still right that the bbc get to mark its own homework in the first instance before ofcom get involve or be an independent inquiry what be need in the light of the repeat failing will the government commit to full review of the bbc impartiality and governance standard as part of the royal charter renewal and can she provide an update to the house on why the charter renewal framework and green paper have not yet be publish thank the secretary of state for her work so far she will have the support of the opposition and welcome her commitment to come back to the house to update we all those involve in the event of this weekend will hear the very strong feeling on both side of the house so be grateful to the right hon gentleman for that share his view about the importance of the bbc those of we who believe in the importance of our national broadcaster be probably more angry than anybody about what have happen over the last few day it be precisely because we understand the importance of the bbc that we know the bbc have to do well he ask whether be satisfied with the explanation that have have so far be not have be very clear with the bbc leadership about that and clear that expect to get full explanation immediately without delay the right hon gentleman ask about the possibility of an independent inquiry would say to all member of this house that be not sure that we need an inquiry to establish that it should have be foreseeable that there would be problem with broadcast this weekend that the decision to broadcast live without any delay should have be review and that the live feed should have be pull immediately when the chant of death death to the idf begin what want to see from the bbc know the right hon gentleman share this be rapid action to ensure that this can not happen again promise to update the house on these development but should also say that be still expect response from the bbc about an early decision to broadcast documentary about gaza which it be then discover fall short of the bbc own editorial standard expect response swiftly and expect action as well finally can thank the right hon gentleman for mention the jewish community have speak to friend and colleague across the jewish community over the weekend can not describe how much this have impact on they particularly those member of the jewish community who be at glastonbury be extremely distressed to hear that there be organisation that be about to be proscribe by the government whose logo be emblazon very visibly on shirt and banner be concerned to hear report that there be image associate with hamas and other as well as nazi imagery most people who go to glastonbury think go for exactly the reason that have be in the past and suspect the right hon gentleman have as well it be because music festival be an incredible way to bring people together to show support and solidarity to bind nation and to showcase great british talent it be our job collectively to ensure that those festival become again and remain place where everybody in our country be welcome as well as the despicable chant the monologue that precede they by the artist in question clearly draw on the influence of jewish power in music an age old antisemitic trope could the secretary of state say bit more about what conversation she will have with the bbc not just on what it broadcast but on what be allow to happen at glastonbury do she also agree that those age old antisemitic trope whether they be in parliament on stage or in public life should be red line for all of we yes my hon friend have long history of stand up to antisemitism include when it stain and sully our own party and be grateful to he for his leadership on this those question about what happen at glastonbury be not for the bbc there be serious question for the bbc about what it broadcast and the decision that it take but there be also wide question about the sort of thing that we want to see in our country as the secretary of state have be very clear that it be not for the government to try to determine what can be see and what can be hear but also have view about this as an individual do not want to see that sort of thing do not want to hear it and take great exception to it the prime minister be very clear on that point as well it cause harm to people in the real world and have feel that very strongly this weekend that be why this government be determined that wherever we see that form of antisemitism include the appalling comment that my hon friend reference that be target towards an individual in the music industry simply because they be jewish we will always stand up to it and not hesitate to take action call the liberal democrat spokesperson we welcome the secretary of state statement sadly rather than devote our attention today to how this house can push for just and sustainable resolution to the horror of the conflict in the middle east we be talk about something else on this occasion there have be past occasion too it be the deeply inappropriate language use by shock jock attention seek musician and public service broadcaster apparent failure to fulfil its responsibility to uphold its own editorial standard bob vylan chant at glastonbury this weekend be absolutely appalling we can never accept hate fill chant call for death to anyone in our society at music festival or anywhere else whatever the subject it be right that there have be widespread condemnation include from the organiser of glastonbury festival and associate myself and my party with those word of course the uk must push much hard for ceasefire of course we must put pressure on netanyahu government to roll back their military campaign and build sustainable two state solution and of course liberal democrats believe that cultural event must be place for debate but there can simply be no place for hate speech antisemitism and incitement to violence at glastonbury or anywhere else it seem that an editorial failing take place in the bbc coverage the decision to proceed with broadcast this act be particularly hard to understand give the bbc correct decision to take more cautious but ultimately fruitless approach to the broadcasting of kneecap cursory look through the social medium of bob vylan raise the question how exactly be this not foresee of course we also know that kneecap have in the past call for the death of member of this house the failure to use delay coverage effectively and to remove the coverage in timely manner be baffle will the secretary of state tell we whether when she ask the bbc about this issue the subject of charter renewal be raise can she give we concrete reassurance that change will happen and we will never have to put up with this dreadful antisemitism appear on our screen again thank the hon member for his comment and the tone in which he make they it be the responsibility of all of we always to stand up to antisemitism it be sadly battle that be never win the lesson of history be that it fall to every generation to fight antisemitism and fight it again and certainly can promise that this government will always do that let turn to the specific question about the bbc and charter renewal with apology to the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew for not answer his question on this early have not discuss charter renewal in the context of kneecap and the other act broadcast from glastonbury this weekend we have of course discuss charter renewal and it be absolutely right to say that editorial standard must be part of that discussion when we release the term of reference which we be due to do shortly everyone in this house will see clear commitment to that as part of the ongoing conversation we will have about charter renewal finally welcome the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson say that chant of death must not be make to anyone chant of death to anyone be not welcome in our society there be something particularly pernicious about chant death death to the idf many colleague will know that in israel there be conscription model every young person be require to serve in the idf which mean that chant death to the idf be equivalent to call for the death of every single israeli jew that be one of the many reason why we take this so seriously and why it can not be argue that this do not cross very dangerous line thank my right hon friend for her statement share her concern that although freedom of expression must be protect this incident raise serious concern about the editorial standard and judgment exercise as long stand supporter of the bbc be deeply disappointed in it what conversation the secretary of state have with the editorial team to ensure that serious incident like this can never happen again as well as speak to the director general of the bbc on saturday number of official have be in touch with the bbc senior leadership team we have put to they series of specific question that we expect immediate answer on and we will continue to press hard to ensure that they be forthcoming will of course update the house at the early opportunity and expect to speak to the chairman of the bbc in the come day call the chair of the select committee refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests thank the secretary of state for that strong and welcome statement the bbc editorial guideline on livestreame be actually quite clear they say the level of monitoring should be appropriate for the likely content producer should normally be in position to cut the feed from live stream if it become necessary what explanation have the bbc give for why the livestream be not cut it can not be for lack of staff on the ground the bbc take report people to glastonbury at the weekend what be they all do for such vast operation with multi simultaneous live show go out across various different part of the site have the secretary of state have the opportunity to ask the bbc who have the final say on which band be deem suitable for live broadcast and why on earth it choose this one and who make the final decision when it become necessary to cut livestream the hon lady ask series of typically important and relevant question some of which have put to the bbc directly but will make sure that ask it all those question with response expect as soon as possible she be right to raise the number of staff who be present at glastonbury festival or work on the broadcast and to ask what they be do but this also raise very serious question at the high level of the bbc about operational oversight and the way in which editorial standard be understand and reflect in the decision of individual staff have already have that conversation with the bbc board in relation to gaza documentary but expect to have it again in the come week refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for the bbc and former employee of the prospect and bectu union which represent bbc staff welcome my right hon friend statement and the bbc own statement today which make it clear that the performer antisemitic sentiment be utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwave and that the bbc will examine its guidance on live event to ensure that team be clear on when it be acceptable to keep output on air do the secretary of state agree that it be possible to express concern about the appalling suffering in gaza without use language that risk fuel hatred and division or incite violence my hon friend make an incredibly important point as somebody who have be associate with the palestinian cause for nearly two decade and have consistently speak out about the israeli government treatment of people not just in gaza but in the west bank know that it be entirely possible to stand up for the palestinians and never ever to stray into antisemitism many member of this house have manage to do precisely that over many year nobody be object to the comment that say free palestine what everybody be object to be the comment that be clearly antisemitic incited hatred and cause real world harm to people in the jewish community in our country could not agree more with my hon friend and support he on that for those who say that this be freedom of speech issue say that it be nothing of the kind this be about stand up against hatred discrimination and racism in all its form but particularly antisemitism of which we have see an enormous rise in our country in recent year every single one of we need to be vigilant to make sure that it be never allow to spread what we see be an appalling pro terrorist broadcast on our national broadcaster those who chant kill the idf be endorse those who kill they and those who kill they be hamas it be an endorsement of the terrorism of hamas yet the bbc deliberately choose not to cut the broadcast therefore perhaps it be time for the government to consider cut the licence fee this government view of hamas be clear they be terrorist organisation they be ban in the uk and there be good reason for that we will continue to be outspoken about that and robust in relation to they be very concerned to hear that there may have be imagery symbol and graffiti in support of hamas at the festival this weekend we will not hesitate to ensure that we deal with and get to the bottom of that in order to stand with our jewish community and with everybody in this country who stand against hamas and be at risk from they on the licence fee the hon and learn gentleman will know that this government support the bbc we believe that it be an important institution that be why we be so disappointed that this have happen and have be so exasperate with the lack of account from the leadership not just about this but about previous gaza documentary and number of other issue the bbc be one of the most important institution in our country and that be why it be hold to the high of standard it be essential that we hold it to the high of standard as we seek to start the charter renewal process which should not just safeguard the future of the bbc for the next year but put it on solid footing for decade to come these be question that we as government collectively with the bbc and all member of this house be determined to grip thank the secretary of state for her excellent statement the murder of hundred of jews at the nova music festival in october spark this war and the irony of broadcast antisemitism at glastonbury here in the uk be not lose on any of we how be jews in this country such as myself to be reassure about editorial process at the bbc and who on earth will be hold accountable for this error my hon friend make an extremely important point about accountability that be not lose on as the secretary of state and it be something that have impress upon the bbc leadership when there be one editorial failure it be something that must be grip where there be several it become problem of leadership very much take his point about that he raise point about the strength of feeling that people have about this issue give that this be music festival and it be at music festival on october that so many young people lose their life with other kidnap never to return to their family and some be still be hold hostage at that moment it would have be the perfect place to express support love and solidarity with those who be still suffer know there be those at the festival who be do precisely that but they be hinder by some of the appalling scene that we have see that be why we be determined to grip this and ensure that music festival be safe and inclusive space for everybody the government be reach out to other music festival and to glastonbury to see what more can be do to express solidarity with those who be still suffer as consequence of the appalling event of october and to see what we can do to support those effort thank the secretary of state for her statement agree with practically everything she have say when hear these report think of the mayor of wilton councillor alexandra boyd who be jewish and about what it would have feel like for she to have watch that with her family we in this place all understand the fine editorial judgment that bbc staff have to make but this be of completely different order when people be lose faith in the great institution of this country urge the secretary of state in her follow up conversation to ensure that the bbc identify accountability to individual my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage set out clearly the guidance that exist somebody do not follow that guidance and think the country expect people to be hold individually to account for why they fail to do their job properly people do expect people to be hold to account for the way they do their job be that on the frontline or at senior level that be point have make to the bbc and it will have hear what the right hon gentleman and my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley say about accountability it be point that will continue to press the secretary of state have speak about responsibility at the bbc and of those who say those dreadful word what responsibility do those who be organise the festival have both legally and morally to be hold responsible and accountable and to ensure that this do not happen again deliberately include some word about the festival itself in my statement because agree with the hon lady we all have responsibility to uphold the high standard and to ensure that people be safe welcome and include at our share national event the report have have over the weekend and this morning be incredibly alarming and they suggest that that be not the case this weekend we be reach out to festival organiser and investigate those report to ensure that this can not happen again another week another month and once again the bbc have get it horribly wrong in its glastonbury broadcast with regard to hamas and to antisemitism and once again there have be another grovel apology ask the secretary of state how long must this go on before regrettably many in the jewish community and million of british people conclude that the bbc be institutionally antisemitic the hon gentleman view about the bbc be very clear but those of we who support the bbc and believe it be an incredibly important institution will know that it should and do in some instance play an important role for all community to be hear and to feel value as part of our public life that be the standard that we expect the bbc to be hold to and this government will hold it to that standard we will not hesitate to take the necessary action to ensure that it rise to meet those standard congratulate the secretary of state on her statement history tell we that normalising condone and tolerate the kind of thing that we see at glastonbury over the weekend never end well it end extremely badly as neighbouring mp have write twice to worthy farm with my concern about kneecap follow report about one of its member advocate the killing of mps there be no reply and none be expect instead the festival schedule bob vylan who as we hear also advocate kill people this time jews do the secretary of state agree that it be no good for glastonbury very wealthy organiser to be bang on about their festival be safe space for everyone while it continue to facilitate operation like that share the right hon gentleman concern about how this be able to happen and be sorry to hear that he have have no response to very serious concern which be raise in his capacity as democratically elect member of parliament for people in the area who deserve answer be happy to follow that up on his behalf and with he after the statement share his view that festival and particularly music festival must be safe inclusive and welcome space and fear that we fall way short on this occasion have visit glastonbury before and know that it provide an incredible showcase for lot of up and come british artist not just those at the top of their game however as the organiser rightly acknowledge line be cross at the weekend and that must not be allow to happen again thank the secretary of state for her statement and the sentiment contain therein but would she agree that in the run up to the festival it be clear to many of we give the track record of some of the participant that this or something like it be go to happen the government be aware that something be go to happen as be the bbc yet still it happen where do the sanction lie who be go to implement the sanction and when be we go to know what it be agree with the hon gentleman sentiment that much of this be foreseeable none of we could know precisely who be go to say what but even cursory glance at google would show that this particular artist have history of provoke extreme statement and behaviour particularly in relation to event in the middle east so it would not have be too difficult to foresee that and there be therefore serious question to answer about livestreame due diligence and other factor expect response from the bbc on those question and about the action that it will take to ensure that this do not happen again if those answer be not forthcoming have various lever with which can hold the bbc to account and want to be clear with the hon gentleman and with the house that will not hesitate to use they if need to do so have those chant call for the death of people of any other nationality or ethnicity there be no question in my mind that the live feed would have be pull straightaway welcome the secretary of state robust statement but do she agree that this problem be systemic and that there have be decade long deep root bias against israel at the corporation which seem unwilling to deal with it or incapable of do so feel the strength of feeling anger and emotion behind what the hon gentleman say feel that from the jewish community over the weekend and from all of we include myself who feel very strongly that this should not have be allow to happen and it certainly should not be allow continually and repeatedly to happen he ask whether there be in build bias at the bbc but think that what have happen be serious failing of editorial standard leadership and oversight which need to ensure we address the hon gentleman say that if the chant have be about any other group the live feed would probably have be pull straightaway but be not sure that we can say that with any confidence as the chair of the culture media and sport committee the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage make clear there be hundred of bbc staff involve in the production and the bbc be represent at glastonbury at the most senior level yet the feed be not pull and the standard be not uphold regardless of which community it affect it be my job to ensure that those standard be uphold give he my word that will use every lever at my disposal to ensure that happen wish we live in world where there be no chanting of death any form of racism be vile be that islamophobia antisemitism or any other kind the secretary of state will recall that only last november israeli football fan be chant death to all arabs and perhaps more sickeningly there be no school in gaza because there be no child that kind of speech and chanting must equally be condemn what be sad be that although we have have ministerial statement today we have no ministerial statement when that chanting happen it be the hypocrisy that be cause an outrage in the british public do the secretary of state not agree that that be what be happen out there in the community could not disagree more and every member of the house utterly condemn chant of death to all arabs as disgusting and disgraceful as principle by which we hold ourselves there be no hesitation from anybody in this house to do that the reason have bring statement to the house today be because our national broadcaster fund by the licence fee that be pay by the public have broadcast something that be deeply offensive to community in this country and that have make many many people feel unsafe and may actually have make they unsafe that be extremely serious and rightly question for government which be why do not hesitate to bring the statement to the house today if the bbc have broadcast the chant that the hon gentleman describe he would be hear the same statement from this dispatch box and the same response from other hon member let also say to the hon gentleman that have stand up for the palestinian cause in this house for the good part of two decade especially when it be hard and unpopular that cost friend and colleague but stand alongside many member of the house to highlight the plight of the palestinian people so as long stand supporter of justice for the palestinians say to he that he do nothing for the palestinian cause by align himself with antisemite blind man on horse could see that there be go to be difficulty broadcast band call kneecap name after terrorist punishment who have call for the death of people in this house we should take moment to reflect that airey neave and ian gow be both kill by republican murderer give the event of the weekend and previous incident be there not pattern emerge will the secretary of state at least test the idea that the bbc have fundamental problem with israel let first recognise that the bbc have be criticise by all side in the conflict for bias which show the difficult editorial line that it have to walk but let also be clear that in relation to what happen at the weekend as the bbc itself have rightly acknowledge the coverage the standard and the enforcement of those standard fall well short of what be expect acknowledge that it be not the first time in recent month that that have happen assure the hon gentleman that the government take this incredibly seriously we be have discussion with the bbc at the most senior level to ensure that this be grip as say previously to other colleague have lever at my disposal and will not hesitate to use they should need to anyone who witness the disgusting image of young middle class educate moron chant death to the idf at the weekend can only be alarmed that we have stoop to this level in our society even bad the state broadcaster broadcast those image across the nation welcome what the secretary of state say and the way in which she say it she have call the director and ask for immediate explanation and expect answer but give that the bbc have already ignore call from this house to explain its bias do she really expect to get any satisfactory answer from an institution that believe be antisemitic at its very core do she have any confidence in any police investigation give that the police have already decide not to prosecute the member of kneecap who call for the killing of tory mp in the last few minute before we come into the chamber for this statement the police announce that there be an ongoing criminal investigation and it be important that we allow the police to do their work of course would not hesitate to call the director general of the bbc and ask for an explanation expect that explanation to be forthcoming and satisfactory by which do not mean that expect excuse about what have or have not be do in this instance expect full and honest explanation of what have clearly go wrong on this occasion and full explanation of what will be do not through another review with month and month of delay or by spend public money on try to get the bottom of what have go wrong but immediately to ensure that this can not happen again on point of order madam deputy speaker towards the end of the secretary of state answer to my question she say that do no favour to the palestinian cause by align myself with antisemite at no stage do say in my question that be align myself with anyone at the glastonbury event will the secretary of state clarify what she mean if she do not mean that apologise but would like some clarity thank the hon gentleman for his point of order which be in fact not point of order do not intend to allow the debate to continue via point of order prax lindsey oil refinery with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement about the prax lindsey oil refinery today its owner have declare insolvency at the refinery and the government be urgently act in response to that deeply concern news know that will be extremely worrying news for worker at the refinery as well as for the wide community in lincolnshire let say very clearly that the government stand with the worker their family and the wide community at this difficult time they have be let down by the company but we will ensure that they be support let take the house through the chain of event lead up to today and the action that we will take in response there have be long stand issue at the refinery since it be acquire in at the end of april the government be inform of ongoing commercial difficulty and the energy secretary meet the chief executive on may to see how the government could provide support the secretary of state be reassure by the company that there be no immediate closure risk at the refinery week ago the business change its position and say that it fear that it could no long be go concern we repeatedly ask it at an official and ministerial level what the financial gap be to work out whether the government could help to bridge that gap but the company be unable to share that basic information as result of today decision by the company an official receiver and administrator have be appoint to take over different part of the business the government will ensure that supply be maintain protect our energy security and do everything we can to support the worker include engage with trade union and industry body let update the house on the government response first we will work with the official receiver over the come day and week to manage the situation at the lindsey oil refinery site and to determine the next step the official receiver will take immediate step to ensure safe operation at the site ensure continued fuel supply and explore all credible option for sale unfortunately the refinery have consistently fail to make profit since it be buy by the current owner from total in it have record total of around million of loss between its acquisition in and the financial year end february that have leave the refinery in very bad shape and the company have leave the government with very little time to act we be support the official receiver in carry out its statutory duty include manage the situation on the site to determine next step that will include urgently report back on the step include all potential us of the site prior to the wind down of the refinery as to the wide business extensive operational and financing interdependency in the prax group mean that the refinery parent company state oil ltd have also be place into administration today along with small number of other group entity however other part of the group include its uk retail business have not go into administration the retail business will trade as normal while the administrator look to secure sale in due course secondly there be question that must be answer about how the owner allow this situation to happen that be why my right hon friend the energy secretary have today write to the insolvency service to demand an immediate investigation of the conduct of the director and the circumstance surround that insolvency thirdly as we engage in this work our immediate priority be to ensure that affected worker at the prax lindsey refinery be support through this difficult time the government believe that the business leadership have responsibility to the worker and the local community we call on it to do the right thing and provide support to the worker through this difficult period the wealthy owner can not wash his hand of his obligation to the worker and their family that be why we call on he to put his hand in his pocket and deliver proper compensation for the worker the government will now urgently work with the company and trade union to explore what further support can be offer to the workforce include the maximum possible help to ensure that worker can pursue new job opportunity if the refinery can not be sell fourthly we be commit more widely to secure the long term future of the uk refinery sector it be important to say that the uk have refining sector with number of well run operator meet the refining sector early this month for ministerial roundtable and it tell that it have not have such meeting with government for year the reality be that the previous government leave the uk refining sector face significant long term challenge we know that there be global challenge too include competition from large refining operation in the middle east india and africa we have already see the effect of year of negligence from previous government and this government have be leave to pick up the piece the uk government be determined to work with industry worker and trade union to ensure that we safeguard our refinery for the future that be why we be review the methodology for the energy intensive industry compensation scheme that we inherit from the last government the refinery sector be not cover by that scheme and the review will help assess whether sector such as this should be cover in the future and whether more can be do to help their competitiveness that be not all in less than month in office we have invest in carbon capture usage and storage which can help key refinery such as phillips and stanlow through viking and hynet we have fund project willow at grangemouth project that can help all refinery meet future challenge and we be drive forward with the sustainable aviation fuel mandate to help the refining sector maximise the opportunity create by the clean energy revolution from the moment we be inform of these issue the government have be focus on secure the future of the prax lindsey oil refinery site and support its worker today those worker have be badly let down by the company but we be commit to support they and the wide community during this difficult time the government be absolutely committed to long term future for the uk refinery sector and over the week and month ahead we will provide further update on the step have set out in this statement commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the minister for advance sight of his statement and for take the time to speak with on this issue early today today hundred of job be at risk and strategically significant asset be in jeopardy the lindsey oil refinery have capacity roughly equivalent to of british petrol consumption and of british diesel and it supply aviation fuel to heathrow airport via pipeline refinery represent core strategic interest for the united kingdom we be reassure that the oil and gas field to the west of shetland be not at risk nor be the network of petrol station affect by today announcement would like to reiterate that that side of the operation be not at risk the refinery have be loss making since it be acquire from totalenergies in and we be aware of long stand financial issue with the prax group include its be unable to provide account to the government as such we support the government in order an investigation into the conduct of the director and the circumstance surround this insolvency however despite the management issue face the company which as the minister have say be multiple it be clear that the refining industry as whole be be drive into the ground by the high cost of energy in this country in the late great britain have oil refinery if the lindsey refinery in the humber close its door only four will remain energy be the single large cost of operate refinery so the sky high cost of energy to industry in the uk be push manufacturer in energy intensive industry such as refine out of business as sir jim ratcliffe at ineos have say the chemical sector be face extinction because of enormously high energy price and crippling carbon tax bill industry in the united kingdom be uncompetitive with two oil refinery close within six month it be quite clear that we need rethink if our route to lower emission in the uk come at the price of deindustrialisation and cost job livelihood and economic growth if it mean impoverish the uk and increase dependence on import and fragile supply chain for fuel and essential oil product then we must rethink if the secretary of state bring refinery within the scope of the energy intensive industry compensation scheme he will be provide only sticking plaster response exempt specific industry from policy cost such as the renewable obligation the feed in tariff the contract for difference subsidy and capacity market payment do not fix the foundation this piecemeal approach simultaneously accept the devastating consequence of green levy for the industry and abdicate responsibility for fix the root problem we be already see the real impact on work people livelihood and community of not take action some job have be lose at grangemouth have be lose at moorcroft pottery in stoke over have be lose at vauxhall in luton and have be lose at nippon electric glass fibre works in wigan now we see the same at the prax lindsey oil refinery where people be employ unite the union have warn the government that their policy have place the oil and gas industry on cliff edge this government be drive up the cost of energy increase our reliance on import and offshore our carbon emission that be not good for the climate and it be very bad for britain refinery have consistently raise the issue of the existential issue that the sector face include the cost of the emission trading scheme and eye wateringly high energy bill since the closure of grangemouth this government have take no action to tackle the fundamental problem the need to reduce the burden on business make uk manufacture more competitive and back british industry have some question for the minister what be the government plan for the lindsey refinery do he expect to find an operator how long will the government support the refinery and what plan do they have for the refinery if no buyer be forthcoming what action will the minister and his government take to ensure that the situation be not replicate at britain four remain refinery how many petroleum refinery do he expect to be leave by the time the labour government leave office in and what will the government do to bring bill down for all industrial energy consumer not just those cover by the energy intensive industry compensation scheme thank the shadow minister for rightly reiterate the fact that it be not the whole of the business we be discuss that have go into administration today it be really important to say that there be certainty in other part of the business we will be able to outline more of that in the day and week ahead also thank he for his and his party support for the investigation into the conduct of the director that the secretary of state have launch clearly something have go badly wrong here and it be important that we get to the bottom of it the shadow minister ask three specific question first the government have back the official receiver who be now run the refinery in the short term we will use that time to see whether there be possibility of find buyer clearly our very first option be to see whether someone want to take on the refinery as go concern and we will put every effort into try to find one if that be not possible we will look at what the wide future of the site might be and what possibility exist for other industry on that site turn to the shadow minister wide question he speak about fix the root of the problem have to gently say to he though that he and his party oppose the action that will fix the root of the problem which be our continued exposure to volatile fossil fuel price that have drive up the cost of electricity as he rightly say household and business right across the country be pay the price for that we have an answer to that which be to move much fast towards clean power system include renewable and nuclear that bring down cost and deliver that power here in the uk rather than rely on the casino for volatile fossil fuel however the shadow minister oppose that plan he can not call for we to fix the root of the problem as he put it while oppose the very action that will do so we have outline credible plan for how we will deliver cheap electricity for all consumer across the country include business and we be get on with deliver it the conservatives oppose all those initiative call the chair of the select committee my hon friend the minister recognise the importance to our energy security of secure the fuel supply at lindsey he also recognise the importance of engage with the trade union to attempt at least to reassure the workforce thank he for those action and congratulate he on they and indeed on the engagement that the government have have with the sector since the election refinery operation be increasingly challenging not least because of the volatility and uncertainty in international fossil fuel market that the minister just mention but also because of the competition across the world phillips and stanlow which he mention in his statement be adapt to the change in our energy system take advantage of carbon capture and the production of sustainable aviation fuel and biofuel will the minister ensure that the uk refinery sector be part of the energy transition and key part of our energy and industrial strategy so that refinery play key part in the future for the community and worker that depend on those job at the moment and so that we do not see cliff edge thank my hon friend for his question first he be right to restate what say in the statement when bring in the refinery industry for roundtable it be frankly extraordinary to be tell that it be the first time in year that that have happen that be an extraordinary state of affair be glad that we have now hold that roundtable but what it have highlight be just how much engagement with the sector be now necessary be determined to drive that engagement forward my hon friend be also right about the nature of the transition refinery will be important at all stage of the transition clearly they be critical to deliver our fuel security today and they will play really important role in that area in the future in sustainable aviation fuel biofuel and the wide work we need that sector to do we will support refinery to transition into some of those future technology the bottom line in this case be that we seem to have have business that be far from do that it be not drive forward the investment that be necessary we will now at pace try to get to the bottom of what the director be do with this company it be shocking state of affair and sad day for the worker but genuinely believe that there will be strong refining sector in the future call the liberal democrat spokesperson too thank the minister for advance notice of the statement today our thought be with the worker at the prax lindsey refinery who have hear this last minute shocking news today which have put their future and job on hold we understand that this be just one refinery within the prax group but the threaten closure will send shockwave across its wide operation with its newly acquire oilfield to the west of shetland and roughly petrol station in the uk under the breeze and harvest energy brand while those facility be outside the insolvency process as thing stand worker in those upstream business and the wide community will understandably be worried about the impact of the insolvency on their job there be question to be ask of the company boss in both state oil and the prax group and it be good to hear the secretary of state announcement of an investigation into how the company boss have let worker down we welcome the minister word that the company should bear some responsibility and accountability for job and skill for those worker if it turn out that the company close we welcome the government proposal to consider add refinery to the network charge compensation scheme for energy intensive industry once again as we have hear we see uk industry buckle under soar energy cost some of the high in europe with worker leave to pay the price many in this house will feel troubling sense of déjà vu follow the grangemouth job loss we have hear from the minister about the state of the refining industry and how the industry have not meet the government for year such situation make it yet clear that the government must set out comprehensive and strategic plan for worker in the oil and gas industry to support the redeployment of skill and training as part of just transition recent report by robert gordon university warn that the uk risk lose ten of thousand of offshore energy job by unless urgent and co ordinate action be take immediately rather than the irresponsible and reckless race backwards to volatile fossil fuel dependency that the conservatives have put forward today the report call for honest dialogue to settle on common uk policy framework order the hon lady will know that the time limit for response to statement be two minute for the liberal democrats be sure she have finish her comment in conclusion many thank madam deputy speaker think get all the hon lady key point down importantly agree with many of they first echo the point that she make about this be shocking news for the worker as it always be give how quickly it have happen it have be as much surprise to we but for the worker it will be particularly shocking news will reiterate two thing that the hon lady say just to be clear she mention the upstream business west of shetland that be not file for insolvency the petrol forecourt will continue to operate as normal and the administrator be explore the prospect of sale of those retail operation there be no need for anyone to be concern about any of that there be an argument that it be critical whatever the outcome that the company take some responsibility for the action it have take up to this point and for the worker who be employ in its business and keep it run for long time have be clear in my statement today and we will continue to reiterate it that we expect the owner to put their hand in their pocket and provide the support that those worker deserve finally be in aberdeen last week talk to people about comprehensive plan and will continue to do that because it be right that we put in place comprehensive plan for the future of those work in oil and gas there be bright future for that workforce in oil and gas for many decade to come but increasingly they will transition into new industry we be determined that we will deliver those job plan be crucial and be work on it at pace thank the minister for his statement and he be right that this news have send shock reverberate around our local area back in april visit the prax site which sit in the constituency of my neighbour the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers speak with the staff and trade union rep about the importance of their work and be impress by their commitment to the company there be absolutely no hint of the scale of difficulty beyond how challenging it be in the refining sector anyway or how deep and uncomfortable the company financial situation be it be astonishing that the company could not answer basic question about its finance when the government ask for those detail the decision take by state oil put more than local job at risk with around of those worker live in north east lincolnshire appreciate the effort that the government be make to support our worker and hope to work closely with the government to help find new buyer to preserve the job and support domestic fuel production as strategically important asset however as thing stand understand that state oil be require only to make statutory redundancy payment to those worker do the minister think that the billionaire owner of the refinery could do more to well support those worker in the event that they lose their job surely that be the least they could do after what appear to be gross mismanagement thank my hon friend for her question by talk of her recent visit to the refinery she underline the issue that have come to light in such an incredibly short space of time although the truth be that in uncover some of this we have discover that it go back some time that be why my right hon friend the secretary of state have announce that he have ask for an inquiry into the decision that have be make we need to get to the bottom of this and learn any lesson that we can my hon friend be right that we have to do everything we can to support the worker we will continue to do that and we will look at what support we can provide for they at the moment these be job at risk rather than redundancy that have be announce we be do everything we can to see whether someone be interested in buy the refinery as go concern in which case the worker would be retain we will do everything we can to support those worker should that not come to fruition my hon friend be right to point out that under the current process those worker will be entitle to statutory redundancy only it be clear that the business leadership have responsibility to those worker not only because it be right and prudent for all owner of business like this to take responsibility for the workforce but because particularly give how this business have end they should take responsibility for the worker and the local community we call on they to do the right thing and support the worker through this incredibly difficult period thank the minister for his statement and for the briefing he give early today it be disturb that when the government reach out to the company for additional information it be not forthcoming the shadow minister my hon friend the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie ask some pertinent question one of which be how long the government be prepared to support the worker and the refinery it would be reassure for many of my constituent who work there if the minister could give some indication that there will be support at least in the medium term be grateful to the hon gentleman for his time early today this will be distressing issue in his constituency so it be good to have the chance to speak to he about it he be right with this decision have be make last night in the court and make public this morning we have not have much time to fully work through the timeline of what will happen in the come week the government be fund the official receiver to continue the safe operation of the refinery the first priority will be to make sure that safe operation proceed but then we will see whether buyer be interested in the site we will then move as quickly as possible if that be not possible to see what alternative there be for the site can not give the hon gentleman assurance on exact timescale at this point but he can be assure that the government be determined to do the right thing and we will do whatever we can to get either buyer or sustainable future for the site reiterate to the house that this be difficult set of circumstance with little time to prepare and the refinery have be loss making since it be take over from total some year ago it be difficult position but we will do everything we can be glad that the root cause of the problem that we face have be identify we have touch on it but this be what happen when private capital be in charge of such key piece of infrastructure we see that play out at the grangemouth refinery in my constituency and it be good to hear my hon friend the minister in agreement with in condemnation of the owner of the prax lindsey refinery it give hope that the government will learn important lesson and assume at least some form of ownership in the future industry that will be come at grangemouth and potentially at other site can we get an update on that please my hon friend be right to highlight the work that the government be do follow our million commitment to support the future of grangemouth through the national wealth fund there have be serious and credible inquiry about project there and have be meet those involve in some of those project to discuss what more the government can do to ensure that they be deliver we will say more about that in due course but we be work collaboratively with the scottish government and scottish enterprise to bring the project forward as we have say since day one we be determined to deliver sustainable viable industrial future for grangemouth the difference between grangemouth and the prax lindsey refinery want to separate the two slightly be that while we may have issue with the owner of various site across the country an month redundancy package be put in place at grangemouth and that be not the case in this instance which be why the government be particularly call on the owner of this refinery to do the right thing for the worker there westminster mismanagement of the energy sector be clearly be feel across these island and the government be right to arrange statement today to address the possible closure of the prax lindsey oil refinery however that be not courtesy that the labour government have ever extend to grangemouth in scotland they have not once come to the chamber to make statement about it we have see labour pull out all the stop for scunthorpe and now begin that process for lindsey will they think again and do the same for grangemouth the shetland gas plant be also own by prax and be also significant employer what step be the government take to secure the future of this site and why do the plant not feature in the statement if only for the purpose of an assurance let deal with that on two front first we have come to the house repeatedly to talk about grangemouth have have meeting with number of member over the past year to discuss grangemouth probably more than have have to discuss any other issue and have weekly meeting with scottish government ministers business or other to discuss grangemouth future no one want the outcome that we get from grangemouth but we have do everything in our power to turn that around and deliver viable economic future for the site so do not entirely accept the hon gentleman criticism which think be misplace secondly apologise to the house for be unable to give explicit detail about every part of the business but one of the problem be that we have not be able to obtain clarity from the company about all the interdependency within its own business group we will discuss more of this in the come day as we engage with the official receiver it be important to separate the issue of insolvency for the refinery the specific issue that we be discuss today from the wide group issue but have no doubt that we will return to some of those in due course the shadow secretary of state mention moorcroft in stoke small glimmer of light in what be otherwise rather gloomy story be the rescue of that company by will moorcroft the grandson of its founder and the job that be potentially come back however those job be put at risk much like the job at this refinery because of the eye water industrial energy cost that we face in this country the government have announce the british industrial competitive scheme but it will not come alive for industrial energy price until which be two year away think hear the minister say that the government would consider the potential for change the criterion for the energy intensive industry compensation scheme to bring in new sector that could be offer some immediate help and some respite between now and the introduction of that scheme if that be the case will the minister be clear about it at the dispatch box and if he be able to look at the eiic criterion can he also look at the exist energy supercharger scheme which would give ceramic company in my constituency access to the support that they need in order to continue to thrive my hon friend be right to mention the impact of high electricity cost across industry since we come to office we have be do everything possible through the industrial strategy and through other work that my colleague in the department for business and trade have be do to try to drive down energy cost and we be do wide work across the energy system to deliver clean power by and to bring down bill and reduce the volatility in bill that affect too many household and business throughout the country we be look at all the possible option and have say to the refinery sector that we be willing to look at all the scheme on case by case basis there be no easy answer to many of these question but we will for example consider eligibility for the industrial competitiveness scheme follow the consultation that will open shortly and it will be review in due course understand that the question relate to how fast we can move on some of these matter but we need to ensure that we get this right and we be do everything we can where we can to move fast with some of the decision the government stand in to secure british steel cite national security and protect job now they be stand in to support prax lindsey cite the need to protect energy security and worker as the minister know ten of thousand of job and many many company in north east scotland be near cliff edge because of the government policy to prevent the need for another eleventh hour standing in by the government will he now support the north sea by end the energy profit levy and allow new licence there should avoid stray into taxation policy which be not in my brief however will say that we be do everything we can to issue speedy response to the consultation on the future of energy in the north sea which be all about how we strategically plan the future of oil and gas in this country to ensure that we be build up the future industry at the same time as support exist oil and gas supply chain and job and we be move that work forward let be clear about what the official receiver do the official receiver be in post with statutory duty but that be not in the same bucket as nationalise an industry it would not be right for the government to underwrite fail business but we have responsibility to ensure that an active refinery be wind down in way that be safe or that we can find buyer to continue it stand in solidarity with the worker in the oil industry who be face such uncertainty and fear this incident illustrate perfectly why carefully manage worker lead transition away from oil and gas be so desperately need to avoid chaotic collapse in which worker pay the price will the minister agree to implement my energy and employment rights bill whose proposal include the publication of plan for the redeployment and retraining of oil and gas worker pay for by oil and gas company across the industry rather than piece by piece and crisis by crisis do not agree with the hon lady propose piece of legislation so will not be support it think that that be the wrong approach although she have highlight the right problem we be move as quickly as possible to plan the transition properly although we should have be do that many year ago when it start and as result we have lose third of the workforce in the past year more than people have lose their job because we fail to plan for this recognise the problem that the hon lady have describe but think that the answer be for we to do two thing to manage the exist field and support the industry for the lifetime of those field and to build up at speed investment in the industry that come next in the spending review the government support industry in respect of carbon capture and storage and hydrogen and of course significant investment in the supply chain through great british energy to ensure that we be build infrastructure in this country again and secure the job that come with it the transition be important and we be do all that we can to ensure that worker be at the heart of it appreciate the minister word of support for the worker who be face such horror and shock and the liberal democrats will work hard to hold he to those word have two question for he the carbon border adjustment mechanism leave uk refinery at disadvantage when it come to the trade in international fuel will the government now consider include that trade in cbam so that our uk refinery can be level peg with the rest of the world secondly the uk now have only one refinery leave face the north sea how many refinery be it okay for we to have when it come to maintain fuel security can the minister be precise in tell how many more can fall after grangemouth and the one that we be discuss thank the hon gentleman for his question and his promise to hold we to account look forward to that he be right to reiterate the point that make at the beginning about the importance of support for the worker and we be call for the company owner to do the right thing as for the carbon border adjustment we have look at three factor the uk emission trading scheme the carbon leakage risk and the feasibility and effectiveness of inclusion the refining sector do not currently meet all those criterion and be therefore not include in scope at present we be look beyond and also consider whether there be more we can do in the short term but clearly there be question about carbon leakage and other matter that we need to work through that be partly why get those in the sector together the first time that have happen for year as it turn out to talk about some of those issue and about their own view be not go to answer the hon gentleman second question with specific number because do not think that be the right way to look at anything around business planning what can say be that refinery be incredibly important to this country they be crucial part of our energy infrastructure and they be important business but business have to operate as successful business while some refinery be absolutely do that this one be clearly an example of where that have not happen we will do everything we can to support the sector but be not go to put specific number on how many refinery we should have in the future whatever the specific reason for the company failure the fact of the matter be that the refining industry have be squeeze for decade as result of government policy when the secretary of state for energy security and net zero stand up and demonise fossil fuel it be hardly surprising that there be not investment in the refining sector if we add the energy cost the carbon taxis and all the other impediment of course we will see business disappear give the fact that we have see aluminium steel oil and now oil refinery disappear from the scene in the uk do the minister not understand that as long as we pursue this demented net zero policy we will have regular announcement of job loss great insecurity in our fuel supply and the loss of heavy industry do not agree with the right hon gentleman on any of his assessment it will not come as huge shock to he or the house for to say that aluminium and steel have not disappear from our industrial landscape in this country but he be right to read out number of thing that this government inherit and have have to fix we have year of failure in industrial policy and that be why we recently announce an industrial policy which be sure the right hon gentleman have read and support we be not agnostic about our industrial future it matter that we build thing in this country again and we need credible plan to do that that be what we have outline in the industrial strategy but will make wide point the right hon gentleman be against all the investment in the clean power that will give we the energy security that he talk about which will take we away from the volatility of fossil fuel repeat this point to he as have do before that investment will deliver the re industrialisation of our community and will give certainty to the industry he talk about that bill will be under control and fall rather than subject to the up and down of an international fossil fuel marketplace that will drive forward economic growth and investment and he oppose all of that understand that lindsey oil refinery have go bust because it be uncompetitive because of high energy price just month after grangemouth close we be witness the disappearance of the oil refining sector in this country because of high energy cost we be witness the deindustrialisation of britain because of high energy cost because of this government obsession with net stupid zero that be the harsh reality that be the simple fact and thousand of job be disappear in front of our eye the minister accept that our energy cost be too high and the government promise that energy bill will come down so could he tell the british people when be always delighted to give the hon gentleman an opportunity for his soundbite of course the problem with soundbite be that one need some detailed credible proposal underneath they and they be in short order from the reform party at the moment it have no credibility whatsoever he seem to have conclude whole series of thing about why this refinery close if he be party to information that the government do not have would be grateful if he share it with we because we have not conclude the investigation that the secretary of state only launch today the refinery have not make profit since so for the hon gentleman to say that the situation be the responsibility of this government energy policy be quite misguided the truth be that while the reform party choose to oppose the investment that will drive forward job and opportunity across the country include in his own constituency we be determined to deliver that because it be the right plan for re industrialisation for economic growth for bring down bill for energy security and for tackle the climate crisis which he might not care about but child across this country who will have to face this planet in the future do care about it thank the minister for his response so far too stand in solidarity with worker at the prax lindsey site whenever big company be responsible for the stewardship of our energy and sometimes for its generation worry that the cost will be pass on to consumer be also worried that worker at the tata steel site in my constituency of lagan valley who be currently engage in industrial action have have their meeting cancel by management do the minister agree that these job be important and key to our transition for the future and that those worker should not be leave behind that be very powerful and well put point that be very happy to agree with worker be right at the heart of our entire economy and will be at the heart of the transition in the future and we need these skill to power the future industry that we be drive forward at the moment we can not afford to lose they and the hon lady be right to make that point do not quite pick up on the cancel meeting but if she want to write to will happily look into it deprivation of citizenship orders effect during appeal bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time of all the duty of government none matter more than keep our country safe it be an awesome task and one to which we attach the utmost significance as this house and the public would expect for people to flourish they must have confidence that they be safe as they go about their life for society to excel its value must be protect from harm and its law uphold for nation to thrive its leader must be unrelenting in the pursuit of these critical aim that be why the prime minister have make national security foundation of the plan for change and it be why we work around the clock with our partner in police and the security service to keep the united kingdom and its people safe in the face of complex and evolve threat picture it be essential that we keep the power tool and measure available to we under constant review where step be need to maintain the safety and security of our country this government will not hesitate to act it be with that intention that we have bring forward this bill which although narrow in its scope and intent be vital to our ongoing effort to protect the united kingdom before come to the detail of the bill will provide little bit of background the british nationality act provide for the removal of an individual british citizenship this be also know as deprivation of citizenship deprivation be an important and effective tool to maintain public safety and preserve national security it be use in two different situation where citizenship have be obtain by fraud or where deprivation be conducive to the public good which mean that it be in the public interest to deprive person of british citizenship because of their conduct the threat that they pose to the united kingdom accept the minister point that this be very narrow bill but be he able to tell the house how many individual who currently have an appeal that have not yet be hear and to whom this bill will ultimately apply have be deprive of their citizenship be happy to do that if my hon friend bear with for just couple of moment will provide he with the information that he have request in the latter category especially where deprivation be conducive to the public good deprivation be use against some of the most dangerous individual include terrorist extremist and serious and organised criminal someone in the uk who have be deprive of their british citizenship no long have any immigration status step may be take to remove they from the uk and they may be hold in an immigration detention in the interim if they be overseas they can not re enter the uk use british passport in both circumstance this be clearly an effective way to disrupt the threat pose by dangerous individual first commend the minister and the government for bring forward this bill there be no doubt but that it be absolutely necessary national security be paramount when consider revoke citizenship as the minister have outline and the bill be necessary to close particular loophole and ensure that no person can bypass it in northern ireland many people claim both irish and uk citizenship as they be able to understand that the bill will make sure their uk citizenship can be revoke but they will still have the right as an irish passport holder to travel to northern ireland that be very peculiar case be quite happy if the minister want to come back to on this but just want to make sure that no one can get around these measure by use an alternative passport an irish passport or whatever it may be and that northern ireland will be under the same law as the rest of the uk be grateful to the hon member for his intervention as always be and he be absolutely right that it be necessary to close this particular loophole and that be the purpose of the bill he have raise very interesting example and be grateful to he for say he be happy for to come back to he if he let reflect on it far will respond to he when make my concluding remark at the end of the debate the minister keep refer to loophole in fact it have be an important principle of british justice that successful appeal equal vindication this bill be try to remove that presumption that be not loophole it be basic judicial right on which we all rely again if the right hon gentleman bear with will come to his specific point in moment and if he be not satisfied that have respond adequately then be happy to give way again will make some progress deprivation decision be make follow careful consideration of advice from official and lawyer and in accordance with international law each case be assess individually decision to deprive where it be conducive to the public good be personally take by the home secretary the power be use sparingly it comply with the un convention on the reduction of statelessness and always come with right of appeal turn to the question from my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell let give the house sense of the frequency with which deprivation power be use from to on average people year be deprive of their citizenship where it be conducive to the public good the available period for fraud relate deprivation be slightly different but from to there be an average of case per year in that category let turn to the bill deal first with why it be require hope this will go some way to respond to the point make by the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse in recent case the supreme court decide that if an appeal against deprivation decision be successful the initial deprivation order will have have no effect and the person will be consider as have continue to be british citizen this mean that people who have be deprive of british citizenship will automatically regain that status before further avenue of appeal have be exhaust by the home secretary will the minister give way be go to make little bit of progress if may will give way in moment but want to address the point that have be raise there be very good reason why the government may wish to stop citizenship be regain until all appeal be determine withdraw or abandon these include to prevent someone who be outside the uk and who pose risk to our national security from return when further appeal may be uphold pende the home secretary decision or to prevent person from renounce their other nationality and put themselves in position where if further appeal be successful further deprivation order would not be possible as it would unlawfully render they stateless thank the minister for that explanation but hypothetically there exist circumstance in which the home secretary could deprive an individual of their citizenship that individual could go for an appeal and have it reinstate and this law would prevent they from retain that citizenship and the department could simply choose not to appeal far how do the department ensure that the individual be then allow to access future appeal to try to regularise their citizenship status for reason that do not understand my hon friend be progress hypothetical scenario do not know whether it be base on particular case that he have in mind have not personally deal with such set of circumstance but be happy to look at the matter he have raise southall community alliance in my constituency have long be defender of human right would the minister confirm to the alliance that this bill mean we will continue to use the power to deprive people of their citizenship very sparingly and that there will be no change to the exist right of appeal or any widening of the reasoning under which we would deprive somebody of their citizenship in this country can absolutely give my hon friend and the organisation in her constituency that assurance this bill be very narrowly draw it have two clause be confused if the individual in question have do something so bad that they have to be deprive of their citizenship why would we not simply jail they why would we need to deprive they of their citizenship hope my hon friend hear the point make moment ago about how the government have bring forward this legislation in response to recent supreme court decision essentially an appeal against deprivation have result in requirement for we to bring forward this clarification of the law in response to she and my hon friend the member for ealing southall deirdre costigan this do not represent any widening of the exist arrangement the right of appeal be completely unaffected by this legislation which be incredibly narrowly draw be sure the minister understand that due process be important and appreciate that the appeal process must be respect fully he be intend make people temporarily stateless so can he guarantee that the appeal process will be speed up and people will have an opportunity to have their case hear in timeous manner so they can have their case resolve not hang over they for long time the hon member be absolutely right about the point of due process can say to he and to my hon friend the member for ealing southall that these power be use very sparingly each and every individual case be decide on by the home secretary know that this home secretary have and be sure previous home secretaries have take these responsibility incredibly seriously decision be make carefully on advice and in accordance with international law and be happy to give the hon member and other that assurance will the minister give way let make bit of progress and then will happily give way again the key point be that deprivation of citizenship on conducive ground be rightly reserve for those who pose threat to the uk or whose conduct involve very high harm we be talk about some of the most serious case handle by any government where loophole be identify in the process underpin it it be the job of any serious and sensible government to close it and that be precisely what this government will do let turn to the substance of the bill the house will note its brevity and narrow scope it contain just one substantive clause focus solely on address the specific issue that have already be discuss its primary objective be to protect the united kingdom from dangerous people which include those who pose threat to our national security the bill will achieve that by prevent those who have be deprive of british citizenship from regain that status automatically when their appeal be successful until further appeal have be determine that will replicate the approach take on asylum and human right appeal in those case the effect of an appeal be suspend up to the court of appeal and extend to appeal to the supreme court to be clear the bill do not change any exist right of appeal or widen the reason why person could be deprive of their citizenship should an appeal mount on behalf of the government prove unsuccessful then where there be no possibility of further appeal british citizenship would be reinstate with immediate and retrospective effect the minister keep refer to loophole in justice do not understand why he can not see that innocent until prove guilty should apply in these case as in any other the idea that my win an appeal would not automatically mean be innocent as it do in every other case seem breach of fundamental tenet he be also not correct to say that the power be use sparingly since dozen of people have be deny citizenship on the say so of the home secretary despite there be nothing prove in court that be what be different about these case this be effectively something that be do in secret behind closed door without the fact necessarily be prove in any way have lot of respect for the hon gentleman but this be case in which we should be even more reliant on due process rather than try to legislate judge out of the room as we be try to today know that the right hon gentleman will understand and appreciate from his time as home office minister the huge responsibility that the government invest in the home secretary the home secretary of the day have to make some incredibly difficult finely balanced judgment hope that he would agree that we have to ensure that the home secretary whoever they be and whatever political party they be from have the necessary power to make decision that safeguard the security of our nation be certain that he and agree on that the bill essentially ensure that the government can continue to do that precisely as the government whom he serve could thank the minister for give way again be again completely confused his specific example at the beginning aside still do not understand why if the individual concern pose such huge threat other piece of legislation will not deal with they and keep the public safe he also point to the fact that somebody could win their appeal and he could still wish to deprive they of citizenship want to understand the circumstance in which after someone appeal be uphold by judge the minister would still wish to deprive they of their citizenship forgive but do not think say that think say the opposite be very happy to discuss the matter far with my hon friend hope she understand and hope have make it clear that the bill be incredibly narrow in its scope it seek to take we back to the legal position we be in matter of month ago prior to the judgment of the supreme court it do not in any way undermine the right of appeal if she have further concern be very happy to speak to she but can give she an assurance she be very welcome to look at the bill it will not take she very long to read it it be two clause with single substantive clause specifically design to take we back to the legal position we be in just few month ago hope she will be reassure by that have come to this debate without any prior knowledge of what be propose so be make this point as result of what have hear so far be right in think that what the minister particularly have in mind be people with dual citizenship who might for example have go abroad to fight for terrorist organisation such as isis there would in such case be nothing forbid we from remove their british citizenship if they come back even if they could be convict of anything at all they would be imprison for only relatively short time if at all and then the security service would probably have to spend many year monitor they be that the sort of scenario the minister have in mind be always grateful to the right hon gentleman it be perhaps he do not hear make that point early but specifically say that one of the reason for the bill be to prevent someone who be outside the uk and who pose risk to our national security from return when further appeal may be uphold by the home secretary decision he be right that be potential scenario that we have to guard against and the bill will enable we to do that just as government could prior to the ruling of the supreme court hope he find that reassuring as set out deprivation be one of the most powerful tool we have in our ongoing effort to protect the united kingdom and its citizen from harm for it to remain an effective part of our armoury we need to legislate before finish pay tribute to our world class law enforcement and intelligence agency in turbulent and uncertain time their tireless work to maintain stability and security at home have never be more crucial they must be support at every turn because the safety of our country stand apart from everything else we do it be the cornerstone of our society and ensure that safety be the primary purpose of everyone involve in public service include in this house it be responsibility bear not just by those of we on the government benches but by parliamentarian of all party in that spirit urge member to support the bill which be require to preserve our national security commend it wholeheartedly to the house call the shadow minister keep our country safe be and must be the first duty of any government that come with decision and choice that government must take to keep their citizen our country and our way of life safe that be why we conservative member support the bill it be much need to close recently create loophole that must be address as member from across the house should agree the issue tackle by the bill arise from the supreme court decision in secretary of state for the home department the court hold that if person successfully appeal against deprivation order or if the order be withdraw they be consider never to have lose their british citizenship that mean that even where the secretary of state intend to challenge such decision through further appeal the person citizenship be automatically restore in the interim in practice that could allow individual to return to the uk or renounce another citizenship or nationality before the home office have exhaust the appeal process the supreme court judgment create two vulnerability an unlocked door through which dangerous individual could return and an escape route allow terrorist to regain citizenship fly back to britain and then renounce other nationality to become untouchable the government own assessment identify specific risk immediate re entry attempt terrorist become stateless to block future action and foreign state interfere in our security measure the supreme court interpretation have create situation that be unprecedented among our ally the united states canada australia france and the netherlands all maintain revocation of citizenship throughout appeal until the february ruling britain framework operate effectively now because of the judgment we face unique vulnerability that no other comparable democracy tolerate remove citizenship be quite rightly consider to be serious step one that be not take lightly or without thorough consideration the seriousness of such decision be reflect in the fact that it be the secretary of state who personally decide whether base on public good and safety an individual should be deprive of their british citizenship the conservative party absolutely agree with the importance of have the power of deprivation of citizenship in order to preserve national security it be power that have be use sparingly but necessarily with previous home secretaries rightly deprive more than individual of their citizenship for be non conducive to the public good these individual risk undermine not only our security but our society at large british citizenship be privilege not an unconditional right those who choose to shatter their bond of loyalty through terrorism or heinous organised crime forfeit their right to carry british passport that be why successive conservative government never shirk from use those power against terrorist plot to kill our citizen or against member of the rochdale grooming gang for their sickening abuse of vulnerable child that be why we be happy to support the government in their attempt to close this loophole today on this island citizenship be an idea still in its infancy when great britain be forge in the act of union in british people be not citizen but subject equal by virtue of their relationship to the monarch only with the british nationality act be the concept of citizenship introduce into our law say that because to my mind we live in an age when political imagination be need more than ever the recent experiment with politic as bureaucratic management be over and we be now return to politic with long history in this country forge the future through imagination and creativity and exercise the collective power to change the value and system by which we be rule at moment like this the relative infancy of citizenship in britain should encourage we to pause to examine an idea we too often glide over and hope that you madam deputy speaker will forgive for do just that citizenship like the motivation behind this bill be connect to one of the great challenge of our time control our border and establish system of legal migration and asylum that be orderly manage humane and in our national interest let start with what my constituent in makerfield tell they want to feel that they and their family belong in the community they live in and they want their neighbour to feel that they belong there too that be why high street full of vape shop dog muck and smash glass matter so much they be visible and constant reminder that other seem not to feel that they belong when people treat their community with respect and love they show that they feel that they belong citizenship be belong on big scale large we it be the unchosen love we feel for our family and even our town project on to the story of country and its people the monarch the flag the mountain hill and sea the industrial skyline of my home town in northern england and the cobbled street of cornwall citizenship be feeling and like any feeling it carry responsibility it be about not only what we be owe but what we owe responsibility contribution duty we live in uncertain time with europe at war the middle east in crisis and the world order be remade at breakneck speed in such time believe we should celebrate and nurture citizenship far more than we do now we hide it away we bury citizenship ceremony in dingy bureaucratic corner of town hall make the test for those who obtain it their capacity to pay thousand of pound for the privilege not their commitment to our country and our value for that be what citizenship should be about believe that citizen of this country should speak our language know our history and share our commitment to fairness tolerance creativity and freedom those who wish to become citizen must in the end be willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with their fellow citizen to defend that freedom in world where it really be threaten that bring to the bill while vote to remain do so after much thought it be always true that the european union change the capacity of elect representative to control border and place clear constitutional constraint on what parliament can do however be always suspicious of those who blame force beyond parliament for their failure to use its immense power my constituent understand simple truth about this country constitution which be that our politician can enact almost any law they please and government with strong majority can do almost whatever they want if they choose not to use those power rarely be it because of some external force whether that be strasbourg or an arm length body instead it be because they be frightened to use their own power or lack the imagination to use it well that be why strongly support the measure in the bill it be not about make people stateless or subvert judge instead it be about do what this place be suppose to do which be to assert the view of parliament on what citizenship mean and how it should be enact value citizenship require be clear about when and under what circumstance it should be take away be an equal full part of our society mean share our value british citizenship affirm person part in our country and there must be way to remove those who threaten it where they have dual citizenship if the home secretary have decide in narrow and prescribe circumstance that it be in the public interest to remove person citizenship because they threaten our security in my view that be what should happen of course we must have an appeal process no one must ever be above the law in this land however an appeal should not mean that the will of elect official be thwart this be part of broad agenda of this government that strongly support change the process of judicial review to ensure that the few can not hold up investment and infrastructure that benefit the many and reform the european convention on human right to update human right for the century strengthen national security and enhance control over our border the british people be feed up with politician pass the buck and blame someone else for their own failure to act if we do not create modern citizenship regime reform the echr and judicial review establish digital id or for that matter radically reform the british state it be nobody fault but our own we the british political class for one be sick of politician throw up their hand and blame other for their own failure will always support government who take responsibility for use parliament to deliver the radical change that this country need and that be why support this bill tonight call the liberal democrat spokesperson the united kingdom employ deprivation of citizenship order more frequently than almost any other country in the world while it be right of course that the government should have the mean to protect national security both the current legislative framework and the bill before we lack adequate provision for transparency in and systematic oversight of when why and how the secretary of state exercise the power to deprive individual of their citizenship the bill be design to ensure that if the government take away someone british citizenship that person stay deprive of that citizenship while any appeal against the decision be ongoing in practical term if the government deprive someone of their citizenship and that person appeal the deprivation order remain in effect through the entire appeal period mean that even if that person win an initial appeal they will not get their citizenship back until all possible appeal from the government up to the high court be finish or the time limit for the government to appeal have pass the home secretary have describe the bill as necessary step to close legal loophole description that have cause some debate already this evening however even if it be loophole that do not mean that these provision deserve any less scrutiny the power to deprive an individual of their citizenship be an exceptionally significant one which in any democratic society should be exercise only in the most limited and extreme circumstance and should be subject to rigorous oversight by parliament we need to see proper reform of the whole citizenship deprivation process not piecemeal approach like we be see today that principle have underpin lib dem policy on the deprivation of citizenship since when it be most recently update at that time our party leader my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey set out clear and just principle that should govern its use deprivation of citizenship should occur only in the most extreme circumstance its use must never be political and the legislation confer this power must be use with transparency and should be the subject of continuous and meaningful parliamentary scrutiny the concern about transparency have be echo by the joint committee on human rights cross house and cross party body early this year it inform the government that their current approach to the deprivation of citizenship fall short of the uk human right obligation the committee call for significantly great oversight of power include periodic independent review of their use and regular report to parliament the current regulation on the deprivation of citizenship already place far too much power in the hand of the secretary of state the requirement that the home secretary be satisfied that deprivation be conducive to the public good be too low bar for the deprivation of citizenship the liberal democrats would therefore confine the power to deprive naturalise citizen of citizenship only where their citizenship have be obtain through fraud false representation or concealment of material fact or where they have do something seriously prejudicial to the vital interest of the united kingdom and deprivation of citizenship be proportionate response to such conduct and necessary for the national security of the united kingdom furthermore we be firmly of the view that no individual should be render stateless by the government action except in case in which british citizenship be acquire by misrepresentation or fraud the power confer by the bill will transfer even great authority to the secretary of state it be therefore essential that those power be subject to ongoing rigorous scrutiny would welcome further detail from the minister about the plan to ensure such oversight for example will the government consider reform the deprivation of citizenship process to require the secretary of state to apply to court for permission to make deprivation order thereby oblige the secretary of state to demonstrate that all the proper requirement have be meet will they commit to publish annual report detail the use of deprivation of citizenship power and to facilitate review of the exercise of these power by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation at least once every three year finally will the minister confirm whether the government intend to ratify the european convention on nationality thereby introduce an additional layer of international scrutiny of the uk use of these power particularly where there be risk of render an individual stateless the power to deprive individual of their citizenship engage fundamental right and must be exercise with appropriate safeguard transparency and oversight deprivation of citizenship must be the strict exception never the norm the bill risk far concentrate excessive power in the hand of the executive with too few safeguard to prevent error or abuse the liberal democrats will continue to press for reform that ensure transparency judicial oversight and proper parliamentary scrutiny agree that the most important role of any government be to keep their citizen safe but do not believe that citizenship be privilege believe that it be right also do not believe that the minister answer my question adequately early want to understand why if somebody be such huge threat to this country we can not deal with they under other legislation if we can not be there not other piece of legislation that require our attention really worry because it feel as if the bill could turn due process on its head we would not accept that in any other branch of justice hope the minister will understand that follow the windrush scandal and the case of shamima begum there be sense of nervousness among many community when any legislation that touch on citizenship be bring before this house that be for good reason they worry that it disproportionately go against people of colour or people who be british bear or long settle whose heritage or ancestral link be outside europe the idea that their citizenship can be revoke because they could be eligible for another nationality be problematic that be fear that many people hold always worry about legislation that seem to circumvent the judiciary ask the minister to consider these concern and please to answer my question understand that he be talk about very specific case but he need to be able to apply it to the many different example that member have put before the house as he have hear many time the deprivation of citizenship be an extremely serious thing we want to make sure that it happen only in the most extreme case want to reflect for moment on the title of the bill it could easily have be call something bit more prosaic such as the revocation of citizenship bill or the withdrawal of citizenship bill but the notion of deprivation be far more evocative when we talk about deprivation it be often in the sense of go without something that be fundamental to our existence such as food shelter water or liberty the very thing that we rely on for life itself believe that deprivation in this context be flawed terminology as it seem to equate citizenship with an essential right apologise if be damage his future career by say so but very much agree with the hon member for makerfield josh simons citizenship be not right it be privilege to those who receive that privilege through our immigration system or otherwise we must be clear that it come with duty and responsibility we welcome those who come to the united kingdom lawfully ready to participate in the freedom that we offer and equally ready to take on the obligation that go hand in hand with they but when an individual who have have the privilege of citizenship bestow on they use it to threaten our national security that privilege should rightly be revoke until the secretary of state have exhaust all avenue of appeal in regard to his or her decision citizenship of our country be to be prize not abuse and not reduce to some sort of transactional process or tick box citizenship test the life in the uk test be well worth look for those who have not see the poverty of knowledge and scrutiny that it require we should not be defend the importance of citizenship only at the point at which person have it remove everyone whether they be citizen through birth or through our immigration system should receive an education in how precious the covenant between country and individual be to promote understanding and appreciation of our value system and the fundamental principle that underpin it tolerance and respect the right to equality before the law the duty of loyalty to the united kingdom or as an absolute minimum deep and abide respect and commitment to the convention and value that make up the british way of life and of course the right to freedom of enterprise and aspiration it be important not only to create wealth and opportunity but to look at how our talent can be harness by make contribution within our family and community whether that be through perform care obligation for young child and mould they as the citizen of the future care for elderly or dependent family member or lead local charity or community or faith group those value and the right and duty through which they be live out form part of our social contract the tie that bind we as community society and nation they have support our past flourish and if re embrace will also secure our renewal those who reject these value and seek to undermine and destroy they should not be citizen of our country although agree with the measure contain in the bill my challenge to the government be to ensure that respect for our national value and the right and duty that underpin they be also at the heart of their forthcoming reform of our immigration system as hope the minister know have devote much of my adult life to keep individual neighbourhood town city and indeed the entire country safe but have to confess that have never be entirely comfortable with the deprivation of citizenship regime unfortunately his bill which he be try to pass off as an innocuous correction have spark that sense of unease the reason be uneasy be that although the objective that the minister propose be laudable believe that the cost to our sense of self and the corrosiveness to our sense of citizenship and to the judicial process be perhaps too high will not detain the house for too long but want to raise three point we have cover they to certain extent but they be worth reiterate first the minister sense be that the supreme court have create loophole my view be that it have correct an anomaly it have long be tenet of the protection with which the judicial process provide as an individual that an appeal equal vindication and that it be for my accuser to appeal on the basis that remain innocent even prior to the first action that be take against this regime will reverse that the second alarming point be that the legislation be retrospective as the hon member for makerfield josh simons ask there may be number of case go through the court for which this law will have highly prejudicial impact the government be effectively move the goalpost mid litigation to get what they want that again be not something we would normally tolerate and it be further development of the power be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way always enjoy our debate he say that the government be move the goalpost but do he accept that we be ensure that we have the same power to deprive that he have when he be home office minister the minister be quite right not that ever exercise those power but as say in my view the supreme court have correct an anomaly that the previous government take advantage of yes absolutely hand up they do be not say that be correct he be propose that in the face of supreme court decision that he do not like he will change the law to say that the court be in effect wrong and that the fundamental right on which the supreme court have decide we should not forget that the court basically decide our right within the legal framework be somehow not to be tolerate have some sympathy with my right hon friend argument but surely the effect of this change will kick in only if in the end the government appeal succeed therefore it will be the case that the court previously be wrong otherwise the government appeal against its decision will not succeed my right hon friend be exactly right however it do mean that the state can render someone stateless by inaction because it can take many year for case to work their way through the court it be also as say highly prejudicial because it mean that for the duration of the legal action that person will not be able to come to the uk and therefore will have to litigate from outside our border grateful to my hon friend for give way again as say in my first intervention be new to this whole debate but think hear from the minister that the idea be for this measure to stand only until the government appeal be resolve or the government run out of time to appeal how long would that period be do not see how that would put thing off for the inordinate amount of time that my right hon friend suggest as be sure my right hon friend know there be various layer of appeal that can be take right up to the supreme court the bill say that throughout that period as long as the government continue to pursue appeal the person remain deprived of their citizenship rather than what the supreme court be say which be that if the person win any one of those appeal they immediately become in effect innocent and their citizenship be restore as if it be never remove in the first place that be in the same way as if be accuse of crime and find innocent and the prosecutor decide to appeal my conviction would remain innocent until that appeal be hear and decide against if it be appeal beyond that would remain innocent then still the government be attempt to revert to the erroneous situation as determine by the supreme court in my view they be move the goalpost on an individual who frankly seem to have win case fair and square in our high court in the land finally want to raise more fundamental issue about this entire process call an old romantic but my view be that once you be citizen you be citizen once you be in you be in unfortunately the development of this power over the last however many year since the act which bring it in have create two class of citizen in this country my hon friend the member for gordon and buchan harriet cross who speak for the opposition she be no long in her place say citizenship be privilege not an unconditional right that be not true it be an unconditional right for as freeborn englishman of two english parent go back do not know how many year have no claim on citizenship anywhere else it be my absolute undeniable unequivocal right to have citizenship in this country and it can not be remove from by any mean whatsoever that be not true of my child be married to canadian citizen so they have claim on canadian citizenship if the home secretary so decide they could have their citizenship remove that be also true of every jewish citizen of the united kingdom who have right to citizenship in israel there will be million of british people of south asian origin who feel that they have second class citizenship this law apply only to certain of our citizen it do not apply to do not know whether it apply to you madam deputy speaker perhaps it be make other hon member think about whether it apply to they while the minister have be clear that we should trust he and have give we lot of undertaking we do not make the law on the basis of minister we like trust and respect we make it on the basis that the law might fall into the hand of somebody we be not that keen on and who may be more cavalier with the power bestow upon they as the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart who speak for the liberal democrats say we be country that use this power disproportionately more than any other western country we have be free in our use of it despite the fact that minister after minister have stand in the house and say we use it sparingly we do not dozen and dozen of people have be exclude and we have to be honest about why sometimes it have be for safety but sometimes on balance it have be to please the paper because it look good and play well we never ask ourselves about the cost of that to our sense of cohesion the hon member for makerfield give lyrical and poetic view of citizenship but if large proportion of our fellow citizen believe that they have second class of that citizenship if some can say be undeniably and unchallengeably citizen but you be not so watch do that do to society do the right hon member believe just by look at and my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler next to that the legislation could apply to people who look like we the hon lady make the point powerfully do not know but she do this legislation leave people from minority background second or third generation immigrant and those like my child who be of two parent of different nationality with lingering sense of doubt about how secure they be in this nation the right hon member be portray the united kingdom as an exception to global rule in which citizenship be straightforward binary and right be of jewish ancestry and have right to claim citizenship in israel though have not my wife be american and our child be dual citizen so this very much pertain to gently point out that the united states have similar regime if naturalise citizen in america break certain law and be demonstrate to be national security threat to the united states they too can have their naturalise citizenship revoke it be not accurate to paint the united kingdom as complete exception to rule in which citizenship whether by birth or by naturalisation be treat differently by the state by the court and by the legislature understand the hon member point but be afraid that be not interested in comparison with the united states would hold we to high bar we be more ancient country that should have as he rightly point out well develop sense of how we build cohesive society would challenge whether the united states can be hold up as paragon of virtue on societal cohesion or whether actually it be divided country with part of that division come from sense that there be first second and maybe even third class citizen there at the moment it be go through period of challenge as to what it mean to be united states citizen we have see litigation under it have slip from my mind it start we the people hon member the constitution that be the word forgive senior moment the united states be see legal challenge under its constitution on precisely those ground of what it mean to be citizen do not want to detain the house for much long but we need to think carefully about the impact that this regime have beyond the people whom it target we may say of case like shamima begum that what she do be completely appalling and she deserve to be punish obviously the decision be take to revoke her citizenship be not sure whether that be the right thing to do do think she need to be punish in many way would rather she have be bring to this country and punish and jail here she be nobody else problem but our as say by promote this regime think we undermine the value of what it mean to be british citizen because once acquire citizenship should be right civis romanus sum it should mean something it be not the key to the executive lavatory to be remove when you lose the privilege and right of your position it be something that you acquire that be fundamentally in you once you be in the club and we should be wary of the wide impact if we decide to remove it have one final suggestion for the minister realise that be in minority and the house be not go to comply he be go to get his legislation however ask he to think carefully about the value of the judiciary in this process would it be possible to amend the process such that when an appeal be win by an individual and the government wish to continue to deprive that person of citizenship the permission of the judge should be seek for that pende further appeal the government will have to seek permission to appeal in all circumstance ask the minister to consider whether they should have to seek also permission to maintain the condition of deprivation of citizenship as part of that permission to appeal call the shadow minister thank the minister for his work and approach today and every day it be pleasure to work across from he against our enemy and in defence of our great country and its people sometimes fulfil our duty to keep our country safe mean take action that we might otherwise wish to avoid but it be completely right that deprive people of their citizenship under certain circumstance be tool available to the home secretary those who hate our country and what it stand for and work against our interest should not be able to hide behind british passport membership of nation do not just imply right it also confer responsibility when british citizen engage in terrorism support for terrorism or serious organise crime they clearly disregard those responsibility it be clearly true that we can not deprive such people of citizenship in all case particularly give that worrying number of extremist be now homegrown but where we can we should if we accept that the deprivation of citizenship be an important tool in keep our country safe we should also accept that this power should be exercise pragmatically with the safety of the british people come first allow potentially dangerous individual to retain their citizenship while appeal be ongoing be absurd this be not power exercise lightly by any government and the idea that dangerous people might escape accountability by exploit procedure be frightening the current system also open up the worrying possibility of dual citizen renounce their non uk citizenship during the appeal process make it subsequently impossible to remove their british citizenship without render they stateless so as my hon friend the member for gordon and buchan harriet cross say early we support the bill which will ensure that deprivation of citizenship order will continue to have effect until the entire appeal process be complete the hon member for makerfield josh simons rightly place the bill in its wide context both historically and politically and agree with he on the desperate need to restore our break border and make british citizenship extremely precious he speak of the citizenship ceremony my grandmother swear allegiance to the king when she become citizen and talk of it often know that it be one of the proud moment of her life the hon member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy say that she consider citizenship right rather than privilege on that be afraid that she and disagree as my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer rightly say immediately afterwards citizenship be to be prize not abuse my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse be right to point out that there be balance to be strike deprivation have cost to those who be deprive say that the cost in the scenario in which the home secretary may exercise deprivation power be more than worth pay to protect this country and her people similarly and more specifically to the bill the cost of maintain deprivation until the conclusion of the process be also price well worth pay say that as british citizen who unlike my right hon friend be entitle to several other citizenship finally the bill be not just good example of decisive action take in the interest of national security it be also good example of parliament role in our political system in this country the main job of the judiciary be to interpret and apply parliament will unlike in other country judge be not the high safeguard of our constitution in britain that task be give to and must remain with the british people themselves when the judiciary make decision that run contrary to the will of parliament either as it be or as it be today parliament be perfectly entitle to overturn that decision in fact it must do so if our political system be to work as it should in say the united states the supreme court job involve work out the intention of long dead statesman that be not the case here in the united kingdom where parliament be living breathe institution embody the sovereignty of the british people it can clarify its will or issue new guidance that kind of institutional dialogue be healthy indeed it be the lifeblood of our politic we therefore welcome not only the specific measure before we today but the approach take by the government on this matter we have see ministers and government members behave as if the law be an entity unto itself an authority above all other entirely separate from the political process that could not be further from the truth we must never forget that the supreme authority in this country be parliament and that the job of parliament be to legislate in the interest of the british people when the legal process produce result that be not in the interest of the british people not only be this house well within its right to overturn it it must do so it be pleasure to follow the shadow minister thank all right hon and hon member who have speak as mention right at the beginning the bill be extremely narrow in its scope and intent focus solely on close loophole in the exist deprivation of citizenship process as outline the supreme court decide in recent case that if an appeal against deprivation decision be successful or deprivation of citizenship order be withdraw that initial order will have have no effect and the person will be consider as have continue to be british that mean that people who have be deprive of british citizenship will automatically regain that status before further avenue of appeal have be exhaust the bill will therefore protect the uk from people who pose threat to our national security by prevent those who have be deprive of british citizenship and be overseas from return until all appeal have be determine it will also prevent person who have be deprive of citizenship on the ground that it be conducive to the public good from seek to undermine deprivation action while an appeal in their case remain ongoing by renounce their other nationality and put themselves in position whereby deprivation order would render they stateless the bill do not change any exist right of appeal or widen the reason for which person could be deprive of their citizenship it be crucial that our world class law enforcement and intelligence agency have the necessary power to protect the public and secure our border let reflect briefly on the contribution make during the debate be very grateful to the opposition front benchers for their support and their speech it be always my intention that national security should never be party political issue that be the basis on which approach it in opposition and that be the basis on which approach it in government be very grateful for the constructive and reasonable way in which they have present their point today be also grateful to the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart for her contribution she take the opportunity as be absolutely her right to call for wide reform and she raise specific concern about the process and about transparency the government believe that the measure in the bill be necessary and proportionate but listen carefully to the point that she make about transparency the government believe that there be sufficient oversight and transparency of the use of the deprivation power the home office publish datum in relation to the number of deprivation of citizenship order and the independent chief inspector of border and immigration have the remit to review the power the icibi have conduct independent review of the deprivation power with report publish relatively recently in and in also want to take the opportunity to far reassure the hon lady that deprivation decision be make follow careful consideration of advice both from official and from lawyer and under this government be sure it be the case under previous government as well strictly in accordance with international law each case be assess individually by the home secretary and decision to deprive where it be conducive to the public good be take by the home secretary and the home secretary alone the power be use sparingly it comply with the un convention on the reduction of statelessness and it always come with the right to appeal my hon friend the member for makerfield josh simons make thoughtful speech include about what citizenship mean and know that the house will be grateful for the contribution that he make this evening my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy raise number of specific concern and want to do my good to respond to they the deprivation of citizenship on conducive ground be rightly reserve for those who pose threat to the uk or whose conduct involve very high harm deprivation on fraud ground be for those who obtain their citizenship fraudulently so be never entitle to it in the first place decision be make follow careful consideration of advice from official and in respect of conducive deprivation lawyer and in accordance with international law include the un convention on the reduction of statelessness the government take these matter very seriously and hope that my hon friend will understand that we have to ensure that we have the power necessary to keep the public safe hope the minister understand the assurance have be ask for this will be the third time have ask genuinely want to understand why someone who be such danger to our public can not be deal with under other piece of legislation at the moment it seem that we can not even stop they come into the country because of the exist legislation he also keep say that the bill do not widen the situation under which people can be deprive of their citizenship but it do it do so on the basis that someone can win an appeal and then be tell that they be not go to be give their citizenship back because the government have further right of appeal the bill do widen that situation we genuinely need those assurance and an understanding as to why such dangerous people can not be deal with under other piece of legislation do not agree with my hon friend second point this bill have be very carefully and narrowly draft and do not think it do the thing that she have say it do as to why the government would seek to use these power hope she understand that we will do everything we possibly can as be sure the previous government do to keep the public safe and protect they from high harm individual such as extremist terrorist and serious and organised criminal and that this government as be the case with the previous government consider that this be an appropriate necessary and proportionate way in which to do that hope that the public and the house will understand why we be progress in the way that we be the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer make very thoughtful speech he have clearly think about this matter long and hard and he have do the house great service with his contribution want to reflect briefly on the contribution make by the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse enjoy debate these matter with he and be genuinely grateful for his contribution he suggest at one point that he might be an old romantic could possibly comment but could possibly say that he have advance some interesting point they be not point that the government agree with and hope he do not mind say that they be not point that the majority of member of this house agree with but he have ensure that this debate have be rich than it would otherwise have be have he not make those contribution hope that the right hon gentleman acknowledge that the government be act in good faith in order to ensure that we be well place to keep the country safe know that he be not satisfied with the measure that we have bring forward and do not agree with they that be absolutely his right respect his right to make the case in the way that he have but would ask he briefly to consider an alternative scenario in which the government of the day regardless of their political party do not put in place the necessary power to keep the public safe one can only imagine the criticism that any government would face be they not to do that can imagine that situation but have be an enthusiastic supporter of lot of power to protect the public from people from whom the minister can not remove citizenship for example terrorism prevention and investigation measure or tpim previously control order be specifically design to put restriction on individual who present danger to the country but from whom the government could not remove citizenship if those measure be good enough for those people why be they not good enough for the people on whom the minister be confer second class citizenship he must see that this legislation apply only to certain of our citizen and that they be not the only one who present danger to this country again be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his contribution do not doubt that if he and and other sit in room and seek to design system we probably would not end up with the one that we have but hope he understand that give the constraint on parliamentary time and the bandwidth of government we be seek to go back to the position that we have number of month ago know that he do not agree with it then to ensure that we have the power that we need so that we be well place to respond in the circumstance that have describe want briefly to come back to the hon member for strangford jim shannon because give he an assurance that would do so can say to he that dual british irish national could be deprive of british citizenship and exclude by the home secretary an irish national who have be exclude from the uk would then require leave to enter hope that respond to his point this bill although short in length will have an important impact on the safety of those in our nation it will ensure that those who pose threat to the safety and security of our country do not have their citizenship restore until all appeal have be determine the safety and security of those in our country be the foundation on which everything else be build and as have remark in this house before for this government nothing will matter more with that commend the bill to the house question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time deprivation of citizenship orders effect during appeal bill programme motion make and question

town councils motion make and question propose that this house do now turley before begin my speech let pay my respect to my constituent curtis davies who be resident of shildon and work for durham police who sadly die yesterday in difficult circumstance know that he will be miss by his colleague in the police force and by his family my thought and prayer be with they all like many in this place spend lot of my time knock on door and listen to resident one thing that have never cease to impress about the people in bishop auckland be the way that they love their community and neighbourhood and the pride that people take in the little thing such as the physical appearance and beauty of the local environment but also the safety of our road want to use this debate to highlight some example of where people in village and town across my constituency be feed up and frustrated they feel disempowere by the number of time they ask for simple change to road safety to enhance their community only to be knock back by bureaucrat who apparently know well than the people live on those street what their experience be rise rise give way to my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince thank my hon friend for take my intervention so soon and apologise to my hon friend the member for city of durham mary kelly foy pay tribute to roydon and hastingwood speed watch for the work it do one issue come across when people in my constituency talk to about road safety be that when they ask for change to be make the county council say there have be no fatality there have be no accident on this stretch of road surely we need to be proactive not reactive with these problem hear that same anecdote far too often for it not to be true people be tell due to lack of fatality we can not intervene that be not how we risk assess we do not wait for someone to die before we ascertain that there be risk highway safety be something that have be work on for number of year particularly with the community of the in durham lowes barn bank toll house road and neville cross in particular shincliffe have of all fatality and road accident in city of durham people have be tell again and again that nothing can or will be do despite the fact that other area with few road accident be see road improvement do my hon friend agree that one of the big barrier to road improvement in county durham be the arbitrary and rather baffle decision of county durham council highway department agree with that assessment it seem that it do not really matter who be in power councillor do not seem to be listen to either think it be problem for democracy that so many people be say the same thing only to be ignore over and over again so welcome that intervention be grateful that so many colleague have attend this debate which be testament to the frustration we all feel the experience that my hon friend express be probably one that we will hear several time indeed have deliberately keep my speech short so that can take as many will give way thank my hon friend for invite an intervention in my constituency road safety be huge concern of local people despite the fact that london borough have the power to set speed limit indeed most of ealing southall be mph zone however the council do not have the power to enforce the speed limit only the metropolitan police have that power do my hon friend agree it be important that we consider whether council that already have the right to set speed limit should also have the power to enforce they that be an excellent point that have not consider so will tack it on to the end of my speech welcome that intervention there will be lot of intervention tonight but say to the minister that perhaps we could have some sort of deal whereby if she give in to my demand minute in we will not take the debate to the full two and half hour that we could have rise how could not commend the hon gentleman for secure this debate we do not have parish council in northern ireland but council have an important role they be not the enforcer of road safety like the police but they have an active role it be clear that local knowledge the thing the hon gentleman be refer to be imperative when consider wide range road safety issue do he agree that join up thinking between branch of government be essential to improve safety and ensure that people power always win welcome the hon gentleman point about join up thinking will make some brief progress in my speech because at the heart of what be ask for be for town and parish council to be listen to meet they so often and they be the most local level of government and the close to people who live in those neighbourhood time and again they ask for the same basic thing and they be not listen to will give some example the village of high grange in my constituency have two mph country lane that run either side of it be speak tonight on behalf of the child who ask mam or dad can go across the road to the park but whose parent do not feel safe let they cross that mph lane to get there speak also for the pensioner on the other side of the same village who want to get across the road to the allotment but who do not feel safe crossing over thank my hon friend for secure this debate chris and nicole in my constituency lose their daughter beccy nearly year ago on lose she they discover postcode lottery for bereavement service some police service provide they but some do not it be important that we discuss road safety measure but hope my hon friend will agree that it be also important that we end that lottery so that every family who lose someone in road traffic accident have the bereavement support they should get it be difficult to disagree with that excellent intervention another example be howden le wear where hargill road come down fast lane speak to gentleman there recently who tell that he no long feel safe go out in his electric scooter and go up the road because of the speed at which traffic come hurtle down the bank people there have be ask for traffic enforcement measure as be mention in early intervention congratulate my hon friend on secure this important debate and we can see how many people this issue affect across the country on speeding in our community do he agree with my sentiment from my time as borough councillor in amber valley for kilburn denby holbrook and horsley about the fantastic work parish council do through the speed watch scheme that can be integral to ensure that county council or unitary council listen and collect datum which can be so important when make change in our local community to speed limit and to important road safety measure welcome that intervention parish councillor do sterling work and all who volunteer and give their time for speed watch scheme be make life that bit well for people in their community nonetheless people get frustrate when often that data be not take where they want it to be take in the village of hamsterley in my constituency the traffic through to hamsterley forest on the weekend be often cause of concern villager there have ask if the village could be make mph zone which sound to like reasonable request in fact they have often ask why can we be more like wales welsh village be allow to be mph zone and my constituent get frustrated that they do not have that option on that point why should they be like wales when they could be like edinburgh will my hon friend join in pay tribute to former councillor lesley hinds one could never meet more humble labour councillor but back in she roll out edinburgh city wide mile per hour zone in independent peer review research show that slight injury have reduce by serious injury have reduce by and fatality have reduce by through the leadership of one person life have be save do he agree that we should be use such measure right across the country that important datum give force to my argument we be not talk not about kill people joy but enhance joy in their life so that they feel safe to walk in the road in their village in south derbyshire we have create network between my office and that of parish council across the constituency several parish council have raise the issue of road safety from repton all the way down to overseal they have carry out community speed watch and make recommendation in report about how we can make our road safe include by have crossing right across the road from school improve safety on road where haulage vehicle go up and down despite the fact that those road be unsuitable and use variable speed limit do my hon friend agree that those parish councillor be the good people to make recommendation about what should be carry out in their local community that be exactly the point be make and welcome my hon friend intervention pay tribute to my hon friend for raise this important matter on more serious note offer my deep condolence to two people who lose their life in road accident in reading recently although do not want to comment on that because it be under police investigation commend my hon friend for the work that he be do many small unitary local authority such as the borough council in my town have great deal of local knowledge yet they be often hold back because they be unable to enforce traffic offence such as speeding even when mile per hour zone or other zone have be introduce as my hon friend the member for ealing southall deirdre costigan say it would be wonderful if that power could be delegate to they rather than to the police who be very busy my hon friend make an excellent intervention have mention high grange and hamsterley have only get to on my list so have well move on the resident in coundon gate in my constituency have to put up with mph traffic driving past just metre from their front window and they have ask for traffic calm thank my hon friend deeply for secure this debate the issue come up in the first visit that make in my constituency to walton hall academy which be on mph stretch of road parent find it extremely stressful take their child with special educational need and disability to and from school the young people there be campaign to get the speed limit change but they be hit brick wall with the difficulty in get highway authority to listen do my hon friend agree that community school and young people should be support by highway authority and listen to on such matter my hon friend make an excellent point about community where there be school toft hill primary school in my constituency be on the and child have to cross the road in difficult condition the school lose its lollipop person who have be help the child to cross my hon friend be be very generous with his time as hon member have say it be testament to the importance of the issue that we be all here this evening the minister can relax as on this occasion will not talk about the will in future but about the northern bypass in morpeth which have mph zone in labour party activist and the local parish council make case to the county council that safe crossing be necessary but the issue have not move on do my hon friend agree that it be local people local parish council and local town council who understand their circumstance good and that they should be listen to and give more power in this regard on the matter of parish council recently meet member of staindrop parish council who have be ask for more than decade to have two crossing point at the entrance and exit to their beautiful village which be on the main road between bishop auckland and barnard castle traffic often do not drop its speed down to mph pensioner in staindrop have say that they feel put off from do something as simple as cross the road to attend social function because of their fear of cross that road it be travesty that staindrop parish council can ask for the same thing over and over again but the highway authority just keep say no as proud cornish mp be as strong an advocate as anyone for the role of parish and town council they have their eye and ear on the ground and understand where there be the most serious need for crossing as my hon friend eloquently describe in his constituency do he agree that there be huge need for crossing in nansledan in my constituency where the new newquay strategic road have be build with little consideration for the flow of traffic come into the village do not know if my hon friend need crossing in his constituency because be not local to that area but will tell hon member who do know his parish council and the people who live there if that be what they be ask for they should be listen to my hon friend be be incredibly generous with his time the point he be advance be so important this be not just about the safety of people although that be really important just this week we see horrible incident in my constituency where some goose be run over that be very traumatic incident for resident do he agree it be so vital that this government set out new national road safety strategy do he agree it be important that they listen to local voice from community such as his and mine as they draw up that vital piece of work we be all here and have all stay late because we be the voice of the people we represent and clearly they be all tell we the same thing it fall to the government to do something about the challenge we be raise tonight let quickly mention two or three other place because love my constituent but they be jealous know that will get grief if neglect to mention place such as fleet street in bishop auckland where there be just no road marking at four way stop and people do not know who to give way to that be regular source of concern for parent in the cockton hill area will mention stanley crook and lot of the hilltop village where the traffic just do not want to slow down as people pursue their journey through residential area let also mention kinninvie where two year ago car crash into someone dining room the family be lucky not to be in the dining room at the time that be an area where for donkey year people have say it be dangerous junction people know that and eventually serious accident happen thank my hon friend for bring this really important debate to the house in my community there be an area call griffydam and resident there have be try for year and year to have something happen to their local community one of the interesting thing be the benchmark local knowledge go over and above those not lot of the accident get report nowadays do my hon friend agree that we need to look at local knowledge which go much far than report accident and incident that be an excellent point about local knowledge think back to high grange which talk about where only the local people understand the importance of the allotment and the park and the difficulty of cross the road both those place be just outside the village on the other side of the main road it be testament to my hon friend popularity that we be all here this evening support he on really important issue whether it be bambury street in sandford hill newcastle lane in penkhull or whieldon road in fenton the local knowledge that he so rightly point to have come to not via parish council because have very urban constituency but through diligent and hard work resident association in urban constituency those often provide the very same function that my hon friend point out when the minister get up and answer perhaps we can encourage she to give proper consideration to the view of not only parish council but resident association in urban community which do so much for where they live that be fair point again pay tribute to all the people who serve at that level of government particularly people who give their time freely to serve in resident association just to make life well for their neighbour and the people who live around they will mention two more place before move on there be chapel lane in evenwood where resident often complain about speeding as well as high etherley we have bypass run through bishop auckland year ago we have new shopping area build on one side of it and for year people have be dangerously cross the bypass from one side to the other it be in the section agreement that there be suppose to be safe crossing point but it seem to be the last thing on the developer mind with everything else come first every week people be take risk as they cross over at that bypass we have petition out about that far up the bypass lot of child cross the road at bracks farm my hon friend be be most generous with his time and thank he for secure this really important debate there be busy bridge on the in my constituency which be use by pupil in year and base at the airy hill site of whitby school as well as the parent and pupil who attend airy hill primary school and tourist photograph the steam train that can be see below it be very noisy and windy bridge with heavy road and foot traffic and it be high above the estuary despite that there be no zebra crossing or raise kerb and the speed limit be mph understandably local resident be really worried they have try to lower the speed limit to mph but north yorkshire council be not interested so they have raise petition themselves do my hon friend agree that this be exactly why parish and town council should be give road safety power include the ability to introduce speed limit that be what be call for tonight for parish and town council to be able to decide the speed limit on the road within their boundary they represent the voice of the people in those area will move on from the tour of my constituency although you be all welcome to visit some of these lovely village sometime by train any way you want to come for this start out as hear one anecdote and then would hear another and another until it become obvious that this be serious issue it be about not just fatality accept that fatality be low thank goodness but the quality of people life it be about the fact that too many child be miss out on play and that too many old people be miss out on social activity because they do not feel safe cross their road have look at the regulation that these faceless bureaucrat be use when they so regularly say no to people and it turn out that the road traffic regulation act come into effect in that be the year be bear so it be as old as and it do not give power to parish and town council they have no statutory role beyond advisory consultation thank my hon friend for give way and echo the comment of other colleague he be be very generous with his time thank he for call this debate and give we the opportunity to debate the role of parish council it be something that we seldom do but should do lot more often in my constituency an issue that be frequently raise with in the context of road safety be that of parking on double yellow line in the face of completely absent enforcement my local resident be always look for creative solution in my home village of norton canes and the neighbouring village of heath hayes both parish council have ask our highway authority staffordshire county council to allow they to pay for extra enforcement activity that pragmatic solution be repeatedly refuse by the previous conservative administration be encourage those parish council to try again now that we have new reform administration to see whether the fresh thinking it keep promise we will extend to parking enforcement do my hon friend agree that whether it be traffic calm speeding or parking our parish and town council could play much great role in keep their resident safe welcome my hon friend extension of the debate to parking which be also road safety issue have lose track of how many time resident in the different village and town represent have talk to about ambulance that could not make their way up street because there be no space give that people be not respect traffic rule that be just another way in which people feel that they do not have control over the very street they live on parish and town council operate under the local government act and have no highway or transport power unless they be explicitly delegate so power could be delegate to they they can raise local issue but can not initiate or enforce any regulatory change as such my ask of government be simple first could we look at primary legislation to grant town and parish council the power to set enforceable speed limit if that be step too far could we at least provide strong statutory consultative power so that they can force review of speed limit and strong power to appeal the bad decision that get make and demand proper explanation for the number of time that the computer say no my hon friend have do tremendously well tonight and he have be so generous with his time be fortunate enough to represent two parish council one town council and numerous resident group across my constituency have get dozen of councillor in gildersome drighlington and morley who obviously have the expert knowledge the street by street knowledge and in some case the house by house knowledge to make these decision for themselves my hon friend agree that those council should have the power to change speed limit in their area so perhaps he would like to comment on the mean average speed test that be often use to restrict speeding limit on certain road maybe when she sum up the minister would also like to comment on that issue be tired as be my resident of be tell that the mean average speed be too low to change thing even though people on those road know through their live experience that the outlier be cause all the problem do my hon friend agree order before we proceed think be right in say that every member present who be likely to want to intervene have do so well do would not wish hon member to believe that ordinarily they be likely to get away with the length of intervention that they have get away with tonight understand that this be an important issue and that there be constituency matter that need to be raise and place on the record but do not take the lenience of the chair for grant member should bear in mind as one hon lady have not that if they intervene they be expect to stay till the end of the debate to hear the minister response thank you for your wisdom mr deputy speaker will move to the end of my speech have simple ask it be about the power that we give but it be also about funding recognise that sometimes the reason the answer be no be that decision have to be take and have two thought on that first could we look at way to make the decision make process less expensive one way of do so would simply be to trust local knowledge more than we do if necessary could we not also mandate that council put aside more funding for this area as we have hear from intervention this be clearly and evidently one of the top issue that our constituent raise with we resident have right to know that when they speak with collective voice that voice get hear and respect at all level of government from this place down to their parish council council be democratically elect accountable and rooted in their community resident live experience offer well long term insight than one off traffic monitor snapshot the current system prioritise administrative threshold over genuine local need the government commitment to localism and community empowerment should apply to road safety too and genuinely welcome their commitment to give back control to the british people over many part of their life this be another area where people be ask to have more control before finish it would be remiss of not to put one more road safety issue on record have unsuccessfully bob through two lot of transport question and the spending review that issue be the future of the an important piece of national infrastructure and that future be decide not by parish council but by the treasury would be grateful to know the timeframe for get response on that because the dualling of the be uncertain it be an important piece of national infrastructure for the north of england for people cross the pennines from east to west dualle would reduce the time it take to get to the lake district and would mean far few road closure which really impact on people life there have also be far too many fatality in the area want to steal those last few second to put that on the record thank member for their time this evening begin by congratulate my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on secure this debate and on make such incredibly good use of the extra time we have have thank he for speak so passionately about road safety he be clearly powerful advocate for his constituent we really have tour across the many village and community that he represent and enjoy his effort to namecheck they every single one of they think be pleased to be back here for the second adjournment debate about road safety in less than week be happy to be discuss this important issue again not just because be minister for the future of road which should of course be safe future but because this issue matter to all of we we our family our friend and our colleague all use our road whether as driver rider pedestrian cyclist or passenger in bus or taxi and we all deserve the right to go on our journey know that we will get home safely unusually in an adjournment debate we hear from think member this evening not only from my hon friend the member for bishop auckland but from my hon friend the members for harlow chris vince for city of durham mary kelly foy and for ealing southall deirdre costigan the hon member for strangford jim shannon and my hon friend the members for northampton south mike reader for amber valley linsey farnsworth for edinburgh south west dr arthur for south derbyshire samantha niblett for read central matt rodda for stafford leigh ingham for north northumberland david smith for st austell and newquay noah law for bracknell peter swallow for north west leicestershire amanda hack for stoke on trent central gareth snell for scarborough and whitby alison hume for cannock chase josh newbury and for leeds south west and morley mark sewards hope very much that have not miss anyone out we clearly all agree that no one should be kill or injure on our road and improve road safety be one of my department high priority in there be fatality in report road collision in great britain and more than people be seriously injure have not work out the number but suspect that mean that in the time we have be debate this issue someone will have be seriously injure somewhere on great britain road fatality and injury result from road collision be simply unacceptable and this government be work hard to prevent such tragedy for all road user road safety be fundamental to everything that the government stand for safe road underpin our national mission drive economic growth enable greener journey through active travel ease pressure on the national health service and ensure that everyone can travel safely that be why my department be develop our road safety strategy the first in over decade we will set out more detail in due course member refer to the implementation of road safety at local level local government be the main delivery body for road safety local authority have statutory duty under section of the road traffic act to take step both to reduce and to prevent collision it be for they to determine what measure be appropriate in individual case because they have the local knowledge many member mention the importance of that this evening and it be right that they focus on the area of high risk which may be place where tragic collision have occur however there be nothing to prevent they from implement road safety measure elsewhere indeed it be entirely right to consider what action can be take to prevent collision in the first place although she live in edinburgh south west my constituent amanda write to about power that english council do not have when it come to road safety namely the power to deal with pavement parking be that something that the minister have consider thank my hon friend for once again raise the issue of pavement parking as hope he know be very keen for we to address that issue it have be far too long since the consultation on the option and look forward to the opportunity to publish that consultation and set out the next step in due course hope that no local authority would claim that road measure can be consider only at location where there have be fatality because that be simply not the case understand the importance of use resource effectively where they be most need but the use of such measure should never be arbitrary this government be commit to the devolution of power to local level as we have show through the publication of the english devolution white paper but it be important that the right power be hold at the right level responsibility for highway and traffic sit at county council or unitary level that enable local authority to deliver service in an efficient and consistent way across their area we have no plan to devolve those power far to parish council but it be nevertheless crucial that local highway authority engage with local partner include parish and town council when decide on the measure to take as they can play an absolutely critical role in identify road safety issue in their area they be often the first to hear about near miss or dangerous incident and act as vital link with local resident day to day experience as we have hear time and again this evening local parish and town council as well as resident association as my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central say and indeed schoolchildren parent and wide range of community group have incredibly valuable local knowledge and they need to be listen to and engage with numerous hon member have talk about the need for action to reduce speed include by lower speed limit and the need to enforce speed limit through police action and the introduction of speed camera hon member will know that the enforcement of road traffic law and decision on how available police resource be deploy be the responsibility of chief constable and police and crime commissioner take into account the local problem and demand that they face local highway authority have the power to set speed limit on their road and it be important that this be do in partnership with town and parish council and in consultation with the resident affect be really sorry to hear that in the constituency of my hon friend the member for bishop auckland durham county council have not respond to local call for low speed limit on the stretch of road that he mention urge he the town and parish council and durham county council to discuss this matter as priority and to try to find way forward as my hon friend describe so vividly dangerous road have very real impact on the life of his constituent especially child old people and disabled people this debate will send clear message to durham county council and perhaps to other highway authority about the strength of feel not only among his constituent but in his local community about road safety issue and about the need for highway authority to be accountable to local resident for decision that they take in fulfil their duty local authority have range of traffic management measure available to they to help improve safety in residential area and outside school include pedestrian crossing traffic calm measure school crossing patrol and the introduction of school street where appropriate good street design can help improve road safety and the manual for streets be our key piece of street design guidance it advocate for street to be design to support appropriate vehicle speed from the outset let we build the right road to encourage appropriate speed rather than have to deal with problem when they arise later that will reduce the risk of collision and reduce the severity of collision that do happen we expect local authority to adopt the manual for streets when set their own design standard but that be ultimately choice for they we be work to update the manual to ensure that it be still relevant and enable those design street to do so in way that contribute to sustainable healthy and active community it be for local authority to determine what measure be appropriate in individual case because they have local knowledge of their road but any authority that wish to install scheme to improve safety have my department full backing obviously they will want to make those decision in consultation with local community and the local police welcome the support express by so many hon member this evening and agree that share local knowledge and work in partnership can be very helpful my department give council update guidance on set mph speed limit in march and remind they to reserve the low limit for appropriate location such as outside school with safety and local support at the heart of such decision want to emphasise that we support mph speed limit in the right place as well as improve safety they can enhance quality of life the environment and the local economy but mph zone and limit be well consider on road by road basis base on the safety case to ensure local consent rather than as blanket measure as say local council will want to make decision about local implementation in consultation with local community and the local police they know their road good and simply can not and should not dictate to they from westminster while local authority be free to make their own decision about the speed limit on the road in their care provide they take account of the relevant legislation and guidance they be rightly accountable to local people for those decision my hon friend and his constituent will rightly expect the county council not only to listen to their concern but to be accountable for the decision it make whether it decide to install traffic measure or decline to do so and think that apply to all hon member who have make the powerful case for low speed limit the safe system approach to road safety acknowledge that even careful driver can make mistake but no one should be kill or seriously injure as result of mistake and we know that collision at high speed be much more likely to have tragic outcome which be why the argument hold for reduce speed limit in particular circumstance the department will look at what we can do to support local authority and we stand ready to work with all those look to improve road safety locally my department recognise the excellent work that parish and town council do to improve the safety of local road include through their involvement with community speedwatch scheme be grateful to my hon friend the hon member for amber valley for highlight that valuable volunteering police run community speedwatch scheme enable local volunteer to work with the police and other agency to address identify road policing issue in their locality driver who be detect speed be send letter and the police may take further action if driver be detect multiple time decision on when to adopt community speedwatch scheme be operational matter for police and crime commissioner and chief constable work in conjunction with their local policing plan the responsibility for keep for our road safe can not fall solely to central or local government all road user have part to play and they must all comply with road traffic law in the interest of their own safety and that of other road user as set out in the highway code the hierarchy of road user place those road user most at risk in the event of collision right at the top of the hierarchy the objective of the hierarchy of road user be not to give priority to pedestrian cyclist and horse rider in every situation but rather to ensure more mutually respectful and considerate culture of safe and effective road use that benefit all user this do not detract from the requirement for everyone to behave responsibly there be both legal and moral duty for all road user to obey the law both for safety and to create culture of respect and consideration for all road user there be law in place to ensure that unsafe and dangerous behaviour have no place on our road and be deal with appropriately use the most effective sanction include educational intervention enforcement of the law be matter for the police who will decide on the evidence of each case whether an offence have be commit and the appropriate action to take conclude by again thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland for secure this timely and important debate as say at the start the government treat road safety with the utmost seriousness and we be commit to reduce the number of those kill and injure on our road my department be develop our road safety strategy which be vital for too long we have tolerate lack of progress and this government be determined to act look forward to set out more detail in due course as indeed we will on my hon friend ambition for the question put and agree to house adjourn
