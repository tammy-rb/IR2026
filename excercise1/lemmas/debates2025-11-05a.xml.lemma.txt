ministerial board the safe street mission board and regular stocktake by the prime minister this structure hold the government departments to account as former chair of north ayrshire women aid be concerned to read report that sexual assault and harassment of woman and girl on train have rise by more than third over the past year that add up to incident report across england scotland and wales last year with one in of they affect child do the minister agree that that can not be allow to continue and that we must do more to tackle this shocking rise in violence against woman and girl absolutely agree with my hon friend however there have be recent successful campaign by british transport police and the rail delivery group which be the rail industry fund group represent the view of the rail industry to encourage report of offence against woman and girl and we believe that some of the rise in record offence be because of that success and the willingness of victim to come forward and bystander to intervene or report on victim behalf however we be not complacent the department for transport recently announce million of investment to well connect cctv at train station the project will enable great real time access for the btp to accelerate investigation and identify offender as quickly as possible to bring they to justice over the past year my office and have support depressing number of constituent who have be fail fail by the police and social service for not listen to report of coercive control fail by the family court for not recognise who the victim be and fail by the crown prosecution service for not proceed to prosecute case of domestic abuse because it do not believe the victim to be credible what step be the minister take with colleague from across government to ensure that woman be believe and listen to sadly what my hon friend describe be something that think everybody in the house would recognise we be strengthen the justice system to well support victim and we have commit to ensure that there be specialist rape and sexual offence team in every police force and that police officer receive strong training on violence against woman and girl include on coercive and control behaviour we will also ban anyone with history of violence against woman and girl from join the police force and we will increase the power of the victims commissioner through the victims and courts bill so that they can hold criminal justice system accountable and independently scrutinise the victim code of compliance survivor of domestic abuse and violence along with their child must be able to access affordable housing the local housing allowance introduce by the last labour government to cover the low of private rent now cover only of private rent in wales and in england do the minister agree that unfreezing lha and link it once more to actual local rent be vital to reduce the risk of homelessness for survivor and ensure that they have the safety of stable home when flee abuse thank my hon friend for his passionate plea and absolutely will take up his suggestion in the meeting to which have already refer tier local authority in england have legal requirement to assess and address the need for support within safe accommodation for all domestic abuse victim the government have increase the funding to local authority to million this year an uplift of million from previous year to provide further support in safe accommodation for domestic abuse survivor the ministry for housing communities and local government have publish statutory guidance which be clear that local authority should ensure that sufficient suitable support in safe accommodation be available to meet the need of victim locally last week meet loose women presenter in parliament and hear about their face it together programme first will the minister support the face it together programme secondly will she support plan we have hatch to get poster about it in every gp surgery in this country absolutely do support the loose women in this regard be about to say that would like to think of myself as one but be not sure that that would come across very well agree that signage in gps surgery dentist wait room and pub and club be valuable tool to warn the public about the sign of domestic abuse and can help to point those who be worried about friend or family member to place where they can be help we as government must ensure that when people need to see that signage it will be there and that be what we be do in june ask the government to consider my private member bill call for they to publish strategy to tackle interpersonal abuse and violence against man and boy the strategy would ensure that male survivor of crime that be consider to be violence against woman and girl such as rape sexual assault domestic abuse force marriage and honour base violence be give dedicated support and would also prevent male survivor from have to be in space that should be for woman on september the minister tell that the strategy will be publish early in the autumn we be now well past that what be cause the delay in the publication of the revise vawg strategy and can the minister assure that it will specifically address male survivor of crime that be consider to be violence against woman and girl yes can absolutely give the hon gentleman that assurance and would be more than happy to meet he to discuss these matter and see where we can go forward together the delay be be cause by the fact that the work will be completely cross governmental we must ensure that the allocation process and all the thing that go on in government departments be as good as they possibly can be because the national audit office report about previous vawg strategy have leave lot to be desire and do not want that to happen again in the last couple of month the west midland have see spate of racially motivate attack on woman of colour include rape of sikh woman who now tell that they be scared to walk on our street or use public transport to go to work do the minister agree that there be no place in britain for any kind of racial hatred and that these crime must be punish to the full extent of the law what assurance can she offer woman and girl in my wolverhampton constituency that they will have the full protection of the police and the authority so that they can feel safe thank my hon friend and birmingham constituency neighbour and share his real concern about spate of what appear to be instance of racially motivate sexual violence all can say be that some of these case be sub judice and charge have be lay but absolutely assure he that have speak to organisation that work on the ground with black and minoritise woman to ensure that we do everything we can along with the police and other agency to make sure that woman where he and live feel safe strangulation be an extremely common form of gendere violence up to two third of woman suffer domestic abuse report have be strangle have correspond with the minister about the need for the institute for address strangulation to have fund certainty beyond march next year in order to continue its vital work but have have no assurance know how seriously she take this issue but can she tell we what she be do to make it clear to the chancellor that sustain this lifesaving work must be priority if we be to meet the government target of halve violence against woman and girl greatly appreciate the hon lady question and be very proud when it be announce yesterday that this government would make strangulation in pornography illegal in our country because of the rise tide of its become acceptable much of that work come from the institute that she mention she must be in absolutely no doubt that there be not cabinet minister in the country who be not aware of the strength of my feeling about what should be spend on violence against woman and girl we know and have sadly see through my casework that coercive control can continue for year after relationship have end through the manipulation of child maintenance payment by perpetrator what step be the minister take with her colleague in the department for work and pensions to ensure that the system work to support survivor rather than enable perpetrator have see those case domestic homicide review point to failure in the child maintenance service that have lead to the most tragic circumstance we be work with the department for work and pensions to ensure that the system that operate in our country be completely safe but we be also work with the dwp more widely on exactly what we be do in that department on violence against woman and girl one of my constituent be domestically abuse by someone on dependant visa she have be try to obtain information from uk visas and immigration about whether that person be still in the united kingdom or still have visa would the minister consider measure similar to clare law so that people have the right to ask what person current visa status be and ukvi can release that information to they have handle case myself that be not dissimilar where third party could not be give that information so absolutely understand the hon lady frustration that area which sit within the home office be one that scrutinise very closely and will gladly take away her recommendation because frankly think they be quite good one the minister will know that be unashamedly pro life while strongly welcome the government commitment to end violence against woman and girl surely that must mean protect woman from harm and coercion in every setting give the serious safeguarding concern and report of coercion link to abortion pill by post will she commit to review that policy to ensure that woman be never put at risk the hon lady make very important point about how woman health can be use in coercion especially their fertility on both side of the coin about have an abortion or not have one she will know that unlike she be positively pro choice however she be absolutely right that when we look at any change to abortion legislation in our country those conversation will absolutely be go on and all safeguard will be put in place call the shadow secretary of state this government talk about well protection for woman and girl while actively pass change to our sentencing law that disgracefully mean that more than of groom offender and of rapist send to prison will get their prison time cut be there an assessment of the impact of those change on woman and girl specifically can the minister point to single organisation represent woman and girl that support cut prison time for sexual assault or groom to one third of the sentence will have to go away and check exactly what the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones have say regard the people who the hon lady say will be release because there be of course exception and more exception than there be under her government prison release scheme because people like and my hon friend have oversight of this process and care about the woman involve it be absolutely shocking that someone from government who oversee the total collapse of our prison system where we would not have be able to arrest rapist because there be no place for they in prison can dare to stand there and suggest that that be something that we should it be unbelievable that she can not recognise her own role in this call the liberal democrat spokesperson recently meet the centre for action on rape and abuse also know as cara which support thousand of victim and survivor of sexual violence across essex include in my constituency cara be concerned about future funding and the need for strong focus on tackle sexual violence will the minister confirm that funding for the rape and sexual abuse support fund and independent sexual violence adviser service will continue beyond march and outline how the government will prioritise address sexual violence the ministry of justice which oversee victim funding absolutely ringfence those two sexual violence fund last year to ensure that they be protect as for future funding it would be difficult for to stand here and guarantee anything while the comprehensive spending review be be allocate but as someone who use to work in one of those service find it vanishingly unlikely that they will not be fund in the future stem industries female workforce what step she be take with cabinet colleague to help increase the female workforce within stem industry across government we be support number of initiative to increase the number of woman in science technology engineering and math we have target of woman

while million worker be set to gain essential ai skill through our industry partnership training will open up opportunity in constituency such as airdrie and shotts and put woman and girl at the centre of the ai revolution commend his work in this area do the minister seriously believe that cut funding for the international baccalaureate qualification that be prove to keep more girl study

assessment she have make of the effectiveness of diversity equality and inclusion scheme in the public sector this government be determined to break down barrier to opportunity so that everyone can

humanitarian fund we be provide million this year to the crisis in sudan and both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have be clear that this funding be protect we will keep work at every level to bring this horrific conflict to an end thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question the atrocity of recent day include in el fasher be beyond horrify the suffering inflict on the sudanese people by this war be an affront to humanity red line have be cross in the prosecution of this conflict that can not be allow to stand especially by the uk as the penholder on sudan at the un security council britain need to use its influence to co ordinate robust and strong international action to tighten the screw on the war party press they into ceasefire and end this barbaric conflict the government must go far and upgrade our support for those document evidence of these heinous crime can the minister confirm that that will happen will the minister introduce more hard hit sanction on the key operator and take concert action to deter entity individual and business whose support continue to sustain this awful conflict be action of this nature be co ordinated with international partner and what progress have be make to build up organic civilian political group so that sudan can move back to civilian government after the ceasefire it be essential that we have credible day after plan as soon as possible on the dire humanitarian crisis be the change territorial position of the war party have an impact on the ability to deliver aid and if so what be the plan to counter this we note the announcement early this month think last week in bahrain of the million be provide for emergency aid support for the survivor of sexual violence in el fasher the whole house will recognise the importance of get aid to they so what can the minister say about the delivery of that urgently need aid how be that happen what discussion have the uk government have with the sudan quad in recent day how do the minister define the uk relationship with the quad now and move forward can the minister share his late assessment of the region wide ability to manage the fallout from this terrible conflict have the government carry out an assessment of what different outcome from this conflict would mean for the security of the red sea those carry out the atrocity in sudan need to know that the whole world be watch they and can see what they be do and that there will be consequence thank the right hon lady for that important set of question on accountability we continue to lead the core group in geneva we be support the fact find mechanism of the united nations and it be absolutely vital that work on accountability and justice continue those at the top of both the rsf and the sudanese armed force be responsible for the conduct of their force and they must be hold accountable for their conduct the right hon lady be right to raise question about humanitarian aid be afraid can confirm that the shifting of the frontline be affect aid delivery and aid be clearly not reach el fasher in the volume require the report include the report from the world health organisation last week of both the event in el fasher and the consequence for civilian be horrify can confirm that both the foreign secretary and be in touch with many key player in the region over the weekend include member of the quad the secretary general of the arab league and range of other this be situation of the utmost urgency and more must be do call the chair of the foreign affairs committee the uk as penholder on sudan at the un security council have already play an important role in call an urgent security council meeting this week but what my hon friend say about russia chime with the select committee experience when we visit new york it be suggest to we that the uk have hold back from raise sudan at the security council because it know that russia be likely to use its veto beyond provide direct aid funding which know be priority for the prime minister what can the united kingdom do to focus the mind of the international community on the unfold tragedy in sudan it have go overlook for far too long my right hon friend be experience in these issue question of aid be absolutely vital but as the foreign secretary say over the weekend aid be not enough in conflict of this magnitude we be work with all party to try to ensure change in behaviour from the two conflict party they be take step that be not only inflict horrific hardship and violence on civilian in north darfur and wide sudan but restrict the vital flow of aid which be so important we will continue to work with range of international partner include member of the quad to try to bring this conflict to close the quad statement on september be important and all external party provide support to either side in the conflict must stop do so call the liberal democrat spokesperson the rapid support forces capture of el fasher follow an month siege have usher in new phase of terror report of systematic sexual violence against woman and the summary execution of civilian be truly horrific the minister refer to the un security council which meet last week and demand that all party to the conflict protect civilian and abide by their obligation under international law it be clear that those obligation be be entirely ignore as the penholder on sudan at the un the uk have unique responsibility to show leadership and ensure that protection for citizen be more than just word have three question for the minister first can he confirm whether the uk seek at the un to secure country wide arm embargo secondly do the government consider that the united arab emirates be party to the conflict thirdly in the light of report that british weapon have be supply by the uae to the rsf will the government ban arm sale to the uae until it can be prove that abu dhabi be not re export british arm to the rsf let take this opportunity to be clear on report about british arm because can see from previous discussion in this chamber that there be some confusion there be an article that make reference to range of different arm that might be in use in sudan and have already speak about the importance of all external party not support the two party to the conflict let clear the uk be provide no arm that be of use in the conflict as understand it the article refer to seatbelt or harness which be not prohibit item component of an engine and target practice item all export of which be stop in reiterate that we interpret our arm obligation carefully and strictly but to clear up any confusion for the house in some case these be not item that be prohibit at all none of those item be eligible for export at the moment and none would make any difference to the scene of conflict that we be discuss this afternoon the situation in sudan be beyond devastating indeed sudan ambassador have warn that genocide be take place there as we focus on those who be be violate urge the minister to ensure that the uk government lead international effort to bring the perpetrator of the disgraceful violence against woman and girl to justice no matter how long that take my hon friend ask critical question be pleased to confirm that today the uk have call for special session of the un human rights council in our capacity as leader of the sudan core group this be further action on our part to ensure that there be exactly what my hon friend call for accountability and scrutiny in this horrific conflict call the father of the house obviously what be happen in sudan be absolutely appalling for the people there but we can not insulate ourselves from these sort of conflict mali be about to be take over by terrorist all over africa energetic young man be flee they be walk across to libya be torture and end up in calais it seem to that we must think outside of the box on this issue and we should not wash our hand of it agree with my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell why be we cut overseas aid at the precise moment when the whole of africa be in absolute turmoil we be not an island these young man be come here it would be much well if we arrest and deport they and send they back with some help we should not just lock they up so that they can assist with rebuild sudan eritrea and somalia after all we be one planet be we not thank the father of the house and my constituency neighbour for his question his question in this chamber often surprise be very much alive to the issue he have raise be in algiers two week ago think and meet young man of exactly the profile he describe man who have seek to leave mali and have get stick somewhere on their way to the uk the condition they find themselves in be much more brutal than those that the cruel human trafficker tell they they can expect when they leave their home country and many of they wish to return will have to check but think we have support man and woman in algeria who have return to their country rather than attempt an onward journey to europe and possibly eventually the uk this be vital work in our effort to smash the gang and stop the boat we must as the father of the house say look right back to the place of origin which include some of the place we be talk about today it be estimate that million civilian have be forcibly displace of those be in chad which of course have its own issue what support be be provide to chad and neighbouring country that be housing refugee from sudan we have programme of support for refugee displace in the region as my hon friend rightly say sudan neighbour face range of challenge and the burden of refugee support often fall particularly heavily on the place with the few resource of their own be very happy to write to he with detail about chad but have serve for two year in juba when the right hon member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell be secretary of state for international development know what significant impact conflict in the region can have it displace large number of people which put huge pressure on public service elsewhere thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question and underline the importance of this matter by allow further discussion on sudan in the house the minister be do very good job but the whole house need top level prime ministerial involvement in this matter just as sir tony blair and my noble friend lord cameron be involve when they be prime minister we be witness wholesale slaughter today be not about money and humanitarian aid but about impunity these murderous thug be brag online about their part in the ethnic cleansing that be take place we need to keep very strong record so that we can hold to account as many of these people as we can and we need more action at the un where britain hold the pen we need to demand access for an african union un delegation to el fasher so that they can meet the leader of the rsf and we need to prepare international sanction to be visit on all its leader the right hon gentleman make powerful point base on long year of experience will certainly discuss his suggestion with the minister with responsibility for africa the integrated food security phase classification recently discover condition of famine in el fasher and kadugli it have also state that condition in dilling in south kordofan be likely similar to those in kadugli but those condition can not be classify due to insufficient reliable datum do the minister agree that just as it be unacceptable to indiscriminately kill civilian health worker and aid worker and restrict aid access it be unacceptable to deny access for the purpose of famine classification and be the government make that point to the belligerent that be very important point it be absolutely vital that the ipc have the access it require to make its classification note with alarm and dismay how often this house rely on ipc classification not just in sudan but in gaza it be vital that the ipc can do its work properly so that its classification which be the world standard can be rely on in last night adjournment debate call for lancaster house style conference for all the party to the sudan conflict so that way to peace can be find government members also call for peacemaking force give the urgency of the situation can the minister please see to it that both of those suggestion be investigate and that discussion be open with our partner in the region include nigeria so that the suggestion can be act on take note of the hon gentleman suggestion be sure that he will be aware that six month ago we do host conference think it be in lancaster house for the whole world in order to try to make progress on this question we do so mostly privately give the sensitivity for all involved we will continue to do all we can diplomatically both publicly at the un and behind closed door as part of concerted effort to bring this violence to an end associate myself with the remark make by my hon friend the member for rugby john slinger yesterday he note that in previous conflict concert effort have be make to bring in some form of un peacekeeping force but unfortunately that do not seem very popular in today world will forgive the minister if he think this be naive question but in addition to the humanitarian aid we be provide and the diplomacy we be undertake what can we do to stop civilian from be kill right now be we look at any form of peacekeeping force be it un african union or coalition of the willing to stop civilian be kill right now my hon friend ask the right set of question of course the first priority must be ceasefire as he know there have be peacekeeping force in darfur previously and they have face very considerable difficulty in exercise their mandate when the conflict party be not prepared to take the vital first step which be to hold ceasefire have ask this before and will ask the minister again when will the government publish their africa strategy cover both north africa and sub saharan africa fear that there will be other conflict like this one and as the uk the us and the french have divest politically economically diplomatically and as regard the provision of aid we have see other fill that vacuum such as china russia proxy and terrorist group unless the us the uk the french and other partner and ally get together and get back into africa to support fragile government and stop they become fail government we be likely to see our adversary advance all over africa include in commonwealth country and we be more likely to see more bloodshed rape and torture and what one of our uk paper have call hell on earth in sudan thank the right hon gentleman for his commitment to these issue can reassure he that have be in north africa twice in the past two week and the ministerial team will continue to pay africa the attention that it deserve will have to revert to he on the question of the timetable for publish the africa strategy despite it be the large humanitarian catastrophe on the planet and despite the mass rape and slaughter of civilian when it come to sudan it feel like the world have take moral holiday the atrocity in el fasher be entirely foreseeable this conflict be not new understand that the foreign secretary be lead the fight to keep sudan on the agenda and to secure accountability for the mass atrocity in darfur but do the minister agree that it be time that global leader follow the uk example and show the moral resolve the moral courage and the leadership need to end this deadly assault thank my hon friend for make that important point it be one with which both and the foreign secretary agree as she say at the weekend the world must do more may repeat the question that ask the minister colleague last week be there no other regional power that could intervene physically to separate the war party may put it to the minister that while it be fortunate that we have be grant successive urgent question on this subject in successive week thank to the right hon member for oxford east anneliese dodds to the shadow foreign secretary and to mr speaker it would be recognition of the anxiety feel in all part of the house if the government make regular ministerial statement on it rather than we have to rely on application for urgent question as be sure the house know this ministerial team be very happy to return to the house regularly and mr speaker provide we with plenty of opportunity to do so will take the right hon gentleman comment back to the responsible minister for reason that be sure he will understand will decline his invitation to comment on the regional balance of military force sudan be face the bad humanitarian crisis in the world at the moment with people kill in the past two year and more than million displace there be two aspect to this first humanitarian aid have to get to those who be affect and urgently secondly what measure will the government take to stop the murder rape and torture of innocent civilian in sudan agree with my hon friend about aid access on the tangible step that we be take as say early we have call today for an emergency session of the un human rights council on these question we have support the fact find mission my colleague the minister for africa conduct an event at the un general assembly in september the foreign secretary have describe some of the work she have do too we will keep at it for as long as it take british make military equipment have be find in conflict zone in sudan that include cummins engine find in armoured vehicle which be not subject to export licensing do not go through any check and be not subject to any diversion check have be send to the uae the minister dismiss the concern express early by the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller but be it not clear that our arm export licensing system be not function be not fit for purpose and need full review and that we should have an embargo on all arm export to the uae now agree with he that the uk government need to do more as do the world do that not include international pressure and sanction on all those with link to the war party include as understand it the uae and egypt which be support and fuel the horrific conflict in sudan it be vital that external weaponry do not flow into sudan at this time would not wish to characterise my early remark to the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for bicester and woodstock calum miller as dismiss his concern it be an effort to be precise about what we be talk about the article in question be seat belt target practice item and component of an engine the engine component may have be license at previous time but since then those licence would not apply for get the component into sudan we need to be clear that these be neither bomb nor bullet and nor be they item that be likely to be irreplaceable we be look carefully at those report but give the tone of some of the commentary in this house want we to be absolutely clear what we be talk about our arm export licensing regime be one of the strong in the world recognise the strength of concern in the house but we have duty to be precise about what we be talk about these be not arm as the public would understand they it be right that the hon member for north herefordshire dr chowns raise question about the engine component and we be look carefully at the report about when they may have be transfer but let we be under no illusion the component for that engine be unlikely to be make substantial contribution to the absolutely devastating violence that we be see some million child under five year of age be suffer from acute malnutrition in january the former biden administration say that it judge that the rsf and allied militia have commit genocide in sudan do the british government share the opinion of the former biden administration as the house will know genocide determination be in the view of the british government question for the competent court that do not in any way take away from the horror of what we see and the report that we receive include the world health organisation report from early last week which be absolutely horrify about the scale of the violence take place in sudan sudan be crushingly poor country but it be not without resource so it be hardly surprising that malign state actor and their proxy be closely involved there and not in good way what can be do in particular to disrupt the smuggling of gold from sudan to syria by the wagner group to fund russia war in ukraine my right hon friend my predecessor make an important point about the role of what be know as the wagner group and be now africa corps it have suffer some setback in the region not least in syria but it continue to play deeply malign role we be focus on what russian support be do to that part of the world and it be all malign we will continue to bear down on those question in the way he would expect rise order understand the importance of this urgent question but we have substantial business to get through today so ask that question be short and minister that answer be just as short and on point welcome the aid that the minister have outline for this horrific crisis he be right that we must be precise about what military involvement if any the uk may have via arm sale he will have also hear the concern about the uae and what be happen amnesty international have describe it as hub for arm diversion for year affect conflict not just in sudan but in eritrea can he update the house he say that the government be look closely at the report about arm sale can he update we on what conversation he have have with our counterpart in the uae on that how can we close those loophole so that everybody can have confidence in this matter we have look closely at the report in the guardian and the associate documentary evidence that it have provide have try to set out our assessment of those report we be still look in particular at this question of the engine and the licensing arrangement by which it may have make its way to sudan however unlike some of the report that have see online and elsewhere this be not large scale british arm this be three specific component and the dossier of document include range of other country that be why have focus my remark more broadly can also reassure my hon friend that the uk and the uae continue to discuss these issue include discussion on friday between the foreign secretary and her counterpart give the horrendous apocalyptic scene we be see in sudan and the fact that million people be now estimate to be in acute hunger do the minister still think it be right for the government to cut our overseas development aid budget can he commit to the house that the government will increase it back to of national income and use that funding to fund the uk response in sudan which be so desperately need be happy to enter into the wide debate about aid funding whether in relation to sudan afghanistan or gaza but must also tell the house what see on day to day basis in sudan just as in those other country restrict access be the single most significant cause of harm and that be result of the action of the participant in the conflict there be debate to be have about the overall aid budget but at moment such as this when area that require aid be be cruelly deprive of it we need to focus on where responsibility lie and that be with the party to the conflict thank the government for the leadership they be show on sudan include last week statement at the united nations the minister be right to stress both the urgency and the horror of the current situation in el fasher and beyond but can he set out what be require next at the un in term of both process and outcome to try to stop the violence and to tackle the ongoing humanitarian crisis there be three particular area in which we be focus on un action the first relate to the fact find mission that we have support which be critical to accountability and justice the second relate to the human rights council itself where as say early there will be an emergency session and thirdly we will be discuss with our partner on the united nations security council what more can be can be do follow last week event there the million people who be starve at the moment in sudan be obviously victim of the most ghastly proxy war what engagement do the government have with the uae on all this and on its wide war objective give the vast mineral deposit that exist across sudan include in darfur which clearly lot of people have their greedy eye on the poor people in the poor place as ever be victim of this war there have be number of contribution this afternoon about the various country with an interest in the region we of course continue to discuss the event in sudan with all member of the quad and all those in the region with an interest include the uae which we speak to on friday echo the comment of those who have highlight that the atrocity in sudan be absolutely abhorrent and welcome the minister statement that we must hold those responsible to account but may ask for some further reassurance will he press for the expansion of the jurisdiction of the international criminal court to international crime commit across the whole of sudan as understand it the icc already have the necessary power and indeed it have secure conviction for crime commit in be sure that the house will not find news of that conviction reassuring give that it be year after the fact but accountability measure take effect whenever possible even after such long delay still make an important contribution to the international justice architecture however be happy to look at the question of the mandate if the hon gentleman be concerned about it welcome the minister acknowledgment that the need to stop the horror in sudan be urgent but while hear much talk of continue action nothing other than an emergency meeting call today seem to be happen urgently what step be he take to change to move forward to try some new thing and to make something happen as matter of urgency to stop this horrible conflict remind the hon gentleman that yes we have call for an emergency meeting in the human rights council today and we have also be in discussion with our partner today over the weekend we announce the provision of furth million the foreign secretary have be extensively engage in discussion with all those with influence and have be play my part in the region this weekend as well we will continue to be as imaginative and as determine as the house would expect we to be rape and violence against woman and girl have be use as weapon of war in el fasher with militia act with impunity what support have be give to non governmental organisation work on the ground to support the victim and do the minister agree that diplomatic effort must be ramp up to end this horrific situation do agree with my hon friend about the importance of diplomatic effort we have provide support specifically to deal with sexual and gender base violence which have include send out special team under the auspex of un women and we be work closely with international ngos through the sudan humanitarian fund and other partner the public watching will have be rightly confuse to hear the minister and the shadow minister speak of the importance of aid when it be their government who walk the aid budget back to large percentage of which be spend in the uk what assessment have the minister make of the uk ability to support international aid effort in sudan and indeed around the world want to be so clear about what be the significant driver of hardship in sudan be happy to have this debate at some other time but it be absolutely clear that the driver of hardship be the conduct of the party be sure that there will be debate at other time about the overall question of aid percentage but as say in my statement sudan have be protect as have the aid for gaza we be try to focus on area where we can have the great impact but when the primary issue be humanitarian access and the conduct of the party it be right for we in the chamber to focus on those question the independent commission for aid impact in its evidence to the international development committee make some insightful observation about the focus of the government as the penholder in what way be the minister use the strength of the uk to bring party together to stop the flow of arm mercenary and other resource into sudan we do of course use our role as penholder at the security council but we try to use the full range of our obligation at the un on this question which include lead the core group on sudan at the human rights council that be why we have take the action that we have take today in addition to survive bomb bullet and sexual violence the million people in sudan be face an acute food shortage accord to save the children people be eat leaf grass and even peanut shell to survive that situation have be far compound by the expulsion of the world food programme country director and emergency co ordinator what step if any have the minister or his department take to ensure that the world food programme and other un agency can continue to deliver lifesave assistance immediately without obstruction the hon gentleman have raise an important point can confirm that we have raise directly with both party to the conflict the importance of the issue that he have mention what be happen in el fasher be nothing short of catastrophic my former colleague at the international rescue committee report that although more than people live there few than have be able to flee and make it to nearby tawila which suggest that many may be dead or trap in the city or along the route can the minister say more about what the government be able to do to get these civilian out my hon friend be experience in these matter and she ask the right set of question the detail of what have happen in el fasher and indeed what be still happen be horrify and continue to emerge from north darfur we be do everything we can to try to ensure the safe passage of civilian but must be clear with the house progress be limited and what civilian be face in north darfur remain appal thank the minister very much for his answer open doors report that there have be spike in the abduction and killing of christian man woman and child by radical islamist group church leader have be target with false charge include terrorism and apostasy while christian convert face violence force marriage sexual violence and lose custody of their child many christians be force to flee their home because they feel that to stay would be unsustainable action for those persecute christians be need may ask the minister what can be do to protect christians and religious minority and to stop the violence against they freedom of religious belief be absolutely vital in the region and have raise these question in the region over the past few week obviously in the wide context that we be discuss almost everyone be face very serious risk to their human right but will give the hon gentleman further update in due course on what we have do in sudan specifically as have say before this be war on woman but woman be also fight hard as human right defender in the diaspora and in sudan whether they be run emergency response room or advocate for change can the minister say more about how we be ensure that our aid be go to grassroot woman right base organisation in the discussion at the un in line with the women peace and security agenda will we ensure that woman voice be hear my hon friend be doughty champion on these issue and know that she have be commit to they both in the house and before her election we be focus on ensure that our aid reach woman and on the issue that be face by they in particular include as say early sexual and gender base violence that include the work through both un women which describe and mutual aid group and number of other measure will ask the minister for africa to set that out in more detail for my hon friend as people continue to flee from el fasher to tawila town that be already shelter some displace people it be clear that the situation on the ground in sudan be not only extremely dangerous not to mention barbarous in some case but chaotic it be likely that sudan will need ongoing support for very long time have the minister have those discussion with colleague at the un and from other interested country to make sure that that support be provide for the country whenever we have the opportunity to give it that aid wish we be in position to talk about long term question but as be sure my hon friend will understand as the frontline continue to move rapidly and the conflict remain in such an active phase our effort have be most focused on the urgent question regard ceasefire share the view of member across the house that the crisis in sudan be simply not get enough focus from the world thank the minister for his leadership in this area the situation in sudan be absolutely horrendous in last week attack on the maternity hospital in el fasher almost civilian be kill in the word of the un relief chief woman and girl be be rap mutilate and kill with utter impunity we know that this be an increase trend across the world more aid worker and health worker be be kill what be the government do to ensure that aid worker and health worker be not target what we be do to tackle rape and sexual violence in conflict will the minister also remark on the fact that un staff be still be hold hostage in yemen by the houthis another example of attack on health and aid worker across the world be grateful to my hon friend for raise that specific attack the detail be truly horrify maraud through hospital kill civilian ward by ward include the sick and the injure this be barbaric attack and it be vital that we seek accountability for it not simply for the people of sudan but because we can not as country or an international system allow such thing to pass without that justice and accountability my hon friend raise an important point about yemen the conduct of the houthis have be appalling be pleased to inform the house that some of those detain un official have now safely leave yemen but there be worrying and deeply disturbing trend of houthis capture aid worker with regard to the attack on the hospital it be estimate that of health facility in conflict affect region be no long operate and those that be operate face shortage of medicine and supply that be lead to resurgence of cholera measle dengue fever and malaria as well as neglect tropical disease such as leishmaniasis leprosy and onchocerciasis what step be the government take to ensure that humanitarian assistance and medicine be get to those who need they most my hon friend raise an important point cholera be now endemic in sudan and the spread of waterborne disease be increasingly common in humanitarian crisis know that there be member on both side of the house with experience of post disaster recovery water and sanitation be always vital and it be deeply disturbing that we be see these outbreak in so many place the government will continue to do all we can in the way have describe curriculum and assessment review before we come to the statement from the education secretary should inform the house that mr speaker be disappoint that this announcement be widely trail in the medium this morning before this house have an opportunity to hear directly from the government remind the government front benchers that the expectation set out in the government ministerial code be that

would like to make statement to update the house on this government plan to renew the national curriculum to secure for every child an education steep in our rich history ready to shape our country into the and beyond as outline the future of our national curriculum do so in full knowledge of its past because be part of the first wave to benefit from process begin by jim callaghan great education debate his ambition for curriculum of universal high standard when lord baker introduce national curriculum for the very first time in my generation secure common entitlement to share in the core wisdom that we as nation value most since then our national curriculum have evolve under successive government and now it must evolve again because the world be change as never before as result of artificial intelligence machine learning and hyperconnectivity where once our young people have to compete locally the play field be now global they be step into world of huge opportunity but it be also one of immense change and challenge muddy landscape of misinformation and social medium our current curriculum no long arm they for this brave new world it lack the breadth of knowledge and skill that our child need not only for the job they will go on to do but for the life they will go on to lead we need more and they need more our curriculum sit at the centre of an education system that have forget too many child white working class child child with special educational need and disability the child who be bright but bored not engage as they should be and not achieve as they should that be why ask professor becky francis and an external panel of expert to review our curriculum assessment and qualification to equip every child and every young person to achieve and thrive thank professor francis and the whole panel for their hard work and expertise the review final report and our government response have both be publish today we will publish revised curriculum in for first teaching in we will update our gcse for first teaching from and we be plan to deliver new level qualification from this government be face the future boldly take our education system from narrow to broad that mean curriculum rich in knowledge strong on skill and in everything that we do uncompromise on high standard ground every child education in the most important knowledge and disciplinary skill to master every subject more specific on the most important content to sharpen understanding and more coherent in how different subject slot together to spark connection it will be truly world lead curriculum supportive challenging and urge all child on the house should be in no doubt that will put high standard to work in the service of every child future our work start in the early year through our best start family hub we be support parent as their child take those first step into learning we be set the foundation for their future develop language early expand the reach of math champion and introduce child to number early on as child arrive at school they will begin to master the core subject the one that unlock the rest of the curriculum and read especially whether it be for step by step instruction in science experiment or question in math reading be essential in every subject it add texture colour and context such as in history by read letter from soldier on the frontline of the second world war we have to build that right from the beginning that be why we be introduce new training for reception teacher to meet our ambition for of child to reach the expect standard in the phonic screening check we will double our reading ambition for all teacher training for child who need the most help reach more than primary school and we will train more teacher in school to help they teach read fluency together with reading must come write and speak because in life we all need to express ourselves clearly and confidently whether out loud or in writing in july we publish the new writing framework which include evidence base way to teach writing to child and we be now go far by improve the primary writing assessment to focus on fluency we will also design new oracy framework to support child to become assured and fluent speaker and listener by the time they leave primary school too many child be fall through the gap in the jump to secondary school include on read learn not just to read but to read well must be the entitlement of every child it be the single most powerful driver of life chance that we have yet too often problem that begin in primary be leave to drift in those first year of secondary the focus fade just when it should intensify to make sure that every school be on top of this we be introduce new statutory reading test for all pupil in year we will expect all school to assess progress in writing and math in year as well check excellence in those vital skill our new regional improvement for standard and excellence rise key stage alliance will spread excellence from one school to the next all child will benefit from new combine oracy read and write framework that will be embed across the entire secondary curriculum and the brand new digital version of the national curriculum will help teacher to strengthen connection across subject and stage on those firm foundation we will build choice and breadth as child move into secondary school that mean prepare they to tell fact from fiction truth from lie and right from wrong our young people need rich core of knowledge and skill the high standard that be determined to drive but we must take literacy far and wider the reform english programme of study and english language gcse will open student up to wide range of text to see how argument be make across different type of medium to discover the power of persuasion and emotive language in different context and to understand how they can be use not just to educate but to manipulate exploit by dark force online to spread lie and sow division that be why we be build medium literacy to prepare young people not to consume passively but to engage critically and to recognise and reject disinformation we be not just boost medium literacy we be also boost digital literacy through reform computing curriculum to allow pupil to navigate the opportunity and challenge of ai and much more and we be boost financial literacy to empower young people to make informed choice about money save and investing all our plan aim to take education from narrow to broad we need fundamental shift in what we value in our secondary school for that we need fundamental shift in how we measure attainment and progress to deliver the breadth that we want to see today can announce that we will consult on improved version of progress and attainment because the current structure hold we back in subject that strengthen our economy and our society too often it restrict choice turn child away from subject like drama art and design and music our creative industry be source of such national pride but as ed sheeran have say so powerfully we can not continue to lead on the world stage without broad base in our school at home the art should be for all not just lucky few so we will revitalise art education put it back at the heart of rich and broad curriculum to encourage variety to flourish in our curriculum we will measure what matter we will balance breadth with strong academic core and promote mastery of the fundamental combine with student choice we will strive for academic excellence on broad scale in every classroom art studio dance hall and science lab in those science lab new triple science entitlement will give all young people the good opportunity to get into exciting new career in clean energy digital technology and life science we will build the strong science technology engineering and mathematic foundation and introduce new computing gcse so that student can excel in the new advanced digital and ai qualification address critical skill gap in the tech sector we will go far too with new enrichment entitlement for all that include civic engagement culture nature and adventure and sport which will deepen child investment in their time at school the curriculum can not begin and end in our school it must stretch from the good start in life programme to the white paper last month update the house on our plan for skill much of that be about support young people to build on this new curriculum and to make their choice from clear landscape of level level and the new level with clear pathway through learning and into work which will help they to develop skill to find good job and get on in life professor francis and the expert panel have deliver strong set of recommendation upon which we will now build our new curriculum will be an expression of who we be as modern nation the knowledge skill value and idea that will bring we together and take we forward build on the past to shape the future for family who have withdraw from education the new national curriculum will be chance to rediscover the power of learn once again for every child across the country it will be an invitation not just to share in our national story but to write the next chapter commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement also thank professor francis for her work any criticism of today announcement be direct not at she but at the government response to her review welcome some of the measure announce today be pleased that the government have not move away from our phonic reform in only of six year old meet the expect reading standard today the figure stand at over primary school child in england be now the good reader in the western world also note the introduction of year reading test which support in principle if properly implement this could help to ensure that pupil maintain strong reading skill into secondary school however the review recommend math and english test so why be the secretary of state not introduce statutory math test have serious concern that the propose wide change will water down standard low expectation and divert teaching time away from the core education which give every child the good chance to get on in life the temptation to make the curriculum repository for every social concern be ever present but when everything be priority nothing be if we keep add and add we risk dilute the very core that underpin academic success there be many thing that the government talk about add to the curriculum but there be little honesty about what will be squeeze out as result hope that the secretary of state will be honest about what be be take out of the curriculum particularly in primary school let make some specific point first the review state it be vital that school and college be able to innovate and that teacher have the flexibility to extend the curriculum agree but the government disastrous children wellbeing and schools bill do precisely the opposite by make the national curriculum compulsory for all school and strip away teacher freedom to adapt to the need of pupil it be nonsensical to talk about innovation while stifle it the secretary of state should abandon her assault on academy freedom secondly the government propose to reduce the number of exam by on the ground that only singapore do more well singapore also top the international league table in math and literacy surely we should be learn from singapore education system not disparage it thirdly the government propose to abolish the english baccalaureate which we put in place in order to give all child the chance to learn an academic core scrap the ebacc be backwards step it will steer pupil away from history and language leave few child with an understanding of our national story and few equipped to engage in global economy the irony be not lose on that the education secretary herself study history and language why be she pull up the drawbridge behind she and deny more young people the very opportunity that she benefit from fourthly the education secretary will introduce new compulsory citizenship curriculum for primary school force primary school to use precious time to teach deprive pupil about media literacy and climate change before ensure that they can read write and add up be not go to encourage social mobility which think labour members care about it be not clear at all how they be go to make time for this what aspect of child education be be sacrifice for the secretary of state political posturing as for new lesson on digital literacy and misinformation feel like broken record the education secretary say on the radio this morning be worried about child spend hour in their bedroom look at poisonous material that drip hate in their ear agree the right hon lady be right and have very easy solution get smartphone out of school and ban all our from social medium that do not need lesson it be something the government have the power to do right now to help child with the vile content that they be see online and to address the behaviour issue that we be see in school social media drive knife crime and effect on attainment think the education secretary need lesson on social medium harm not child finally turn to the right hon lady change to school accountability professor francis be clear in her report do not change progress she write we be strongly committed to the progress measure it support both student progress and curriculum breadth we be therefore recommend make no change yet the education secretary have overrule the review the independent review that she commission herself why we have be here before under the last labour government standard fall ambition shrank and the attainment gap widen the number of pupil study core academic subject halve britain slide down international ranking it take conservative reformer like michael gove and nick gibb to turn that around with evidence drive policy rigorous assessment and high expectation order ms trott you have run over your time hope you be go to conclude very quickly that formula work with english school storm back up the global ranking we on the conservative benches will always stand up for rigour evidence and the life change power of high standard we will fight labour education vandalism every step of the way the right hon lady say at the start that any criticism be level my way but she then go on to criticise many of the recommendation in the review have she even bother to read it at all she come here time and again every single time full of sound and fury signify nothing and yes shakespeare be here to stay on the national curriculum she try to paint the report and our response as undo the achievement in school nothing could be far from the truth we be not abandon it we be build on it with curriculum that will allow all young people to achieve high standard with core academic subject alongside the breadth that they deserve our reform have high standard right at their heart they will raise standard of pupil right across the curriculum include in speak and listening reading writing and math our improve progress and attainment measure will ensure that student retain strong academic core but with breadth to expand into further study the right hon lady might oppose the change we be set out but today they have win support from the sutton trust from employer like the cbi and from sir hamid patel the wonderful leader at star academies who back the change we be make say that they signal both welcome emphasis on creativity reflect amazing career opportunity but with continued affirmation that success in english and mathematic be crucial for everyone life chance could not agree more we know that it be important that our new measure provide breadth and enrichment leave aside that the art and creative subject be worth up to billion to our country and employ million people want more young people to have brilliant career and opportunity in those field the two be not in opposition we can and will deliver high and strong academic standard alongside make sure that broad and rich curriculum be the entitlement of every child there be once time when the conservatives support that idea it be why they introduce national curriculum to apply in every school we be restore the conservative principle of the national curriculum apply for every child benefit from that and want every child in our country to benefit from it the curriculum have not be update for over decade parent want one that be fit for the future employer back what we be do and child deserve it the change we be set out today will secure well life chance for all our child welcome curriculum review that will break down barrier it open up so much of the digital and financial literacy that the conservatives seem to think be unimportant to all but which we know will raise aspiration by equip young people from all background have two question that would like to ask the secretary of state one be on examination we know that this country have an examination overload and welcome the propose reduction by it do will listen to the expert before listen to the front bench any day the opposition front bench laughter if the right hon member listen she will hear that will the secretary of state please look at the overall load throughout school not just in gcse year and comment on how she see the introduction of an additional year diagnostic panning out on my second question declare an interest as the vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on modern language we broadly welcome the government response which go far than the recommendation and the recognition of importance it be right to scrap the ebacc which have never really be take seriously by professional but will the secretary of state please say how she will stop uptake from drop immediately what other incentive will there be when will she deliver the feasibility review of the new qualification base on language ladder expertise which be welcome by the sector on language share my hon friend determination to ensure that more young people have the chance to study modern language there be particular challenge that we face around transition from primary to secondary the review make that clear and that be one area for further action on the ebacc be afraid that it do not have the outcome that be intend in improve language take up we be no far forward than we be in in percentage figure we be see increase in the number of teacher come forward to train in modern language and that be welcome also believe that new step qualification will provide useful route for more young people to move on to study language at gcse on exam and time particularly at gcse ofqual have be clear that reduction in the time spend in exam that amount to two and half to three hour be more than achievable while at no point compromise the integrity or the high quality and standard of the system we will work with the regulator to make that happen we be an international outlier on the amount of time our child spend in exam at gcse on the year reading test we will introduce statutory reading test to ensure that problem be identify and child support that will run alongside diagnostic math and write test to ensure that child be also make progress in those key area but if you can not read well you can not do anything else call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement and thank professor becky francis for her important work on the review welcome much of what have be announce today as with free school meal and maintenance grant this secretary of state seem to enjoy adopt liberal democrat policy particularly welcome more enrichment activity and citizenship education include financial and media literacy but today many headteacher across the country will be ask about the how how will we fund this when budget be already overstretch with specialist recruitment target miss year after year include in physics computer science and music how will we find the subject specialist to deliver the new curriculum not least the right to triple science at gcse can the secretary of state set out how she will protect time for other subject give the welcome new enrichment entitlement have she consider use money from fall school roll to perhaps fund long school day turn to the secretary of state claim about breadth instead of scrap the ebacc do she consider broaden it have go explicitly against professor francis recommendation to leave progress unchanged the government actually risk narrow choice the new progress model pit language against creative art for the first time these two change put together could mean the death of language in our state school the review miss the opportunity to broaden level the uk be an outlier in this regard combine with the defunding of the international baccalaureate in state school worry that the secretary of state legacy will be that breadth become the preserve of the privately educate the hon lady ask many constructive question it be important that all young people have the chance to study triple science and we will work with the sector on the implementation of that we be see big increase in the number of teacher in initial teacher training include in physics but there be more to do we will work on this carefully with the sector do not think we can continue to defend position where young people from disadvantaged background do not always have the chance to study triple science we know that if they have that opportunity they be more likely to be able to go on to study level science subject so there be an important social justice consideration that we have to take into account teacher number be up and continue to go up and teacher retention number this year be also move in the right direction all child and young people should have equal access to development opportunity to help they to succeed which be why we be set out core enrichment offer that every school and college should aim to provide the offer will be part of our enrichment framework which we will develop with group of expert across education youth sport and art sector to set out benchmark for school and college to build that offer know that many school already do this very well and we want to build on the good success out there we will also support the wide provision through dormant asset our music hub pe and school sport partnership and much more besides this be real opportunity to deliver step change in ensure that all child get firm foundation in the basic and wide and broad education encourage the hon lady to look at the document that we have set out explain the recommend progress change which we will go on to consult on member should be in no doubt about the difference that these change will make because when our young people succeed society as whole succeed wish to put on the record my thank to the secretary of state for deliver on our promise of curriculum that will well prepare child not just for exam but for life over the year previous education secretaries let be real we have have quite few lose sight of what school should really be about it be about more than exam it be about prepare child for the modern world and the reality of life this renew focus on oracy read writing math and triple science which be vital life skill to order this be statement you must have short question please finish quickly thank you madam deputy speaker financial and medium literacy be core skill to develop young people how will the secretary of state ensure that school have the funding resource and preparation time necessary to implement the reform my hon friend have real passion for this area and bring her expertise to this house and be really grateful for that we will refresh the programme of study and publish they in so there will be an opportunity for consultation and contribution towards that some of this be question about how we well sequence our curriculum between different key stage that be an important element it be important that young people in primary school have more citizenship education include in the critical area of financial literacy be at the wonderful ashmole primary school in lambeth just yesterday where meet year student who be do precisely that if anybody try to say that year student can not understand complicated concept around financial education would suggest that they pay visit to that school and see the amazing work that be go on there this be thorough piece of work from professor francis there be thing in it to welcome include the retention of key stage assessment and the triple science entitlement although the government will have to say where the resourcing will come from to make that reality in truth there be other thing that we just do know yet it remain to be see what the change in english literature mean and what will get squeeze out it also remain to be see what the new computing gcse be relative to computer science hope it be not return to the pre computer science day of the information and communication technology gcse one thing regret be the demise of the ebacc let we remember what that be set of subject that be present clearly to child and their family include and especially disadvantaged child who by study this core set of subject will keep their option most open and have the most opportunity to progress in life the ebacc do increase uptake for history and geography it could have be mitigate if the secretary of state have keep professor francis recommendation to retain the structure of the current progress why do she ignore that recommendation be she give up totally on modern foreign language no madam deputy speaker as set out early it be important that young people have the opportunity to study triple science recognise that the implementation and delivery of that will be important and we will work with the sector to do that the number of those enter initial teacher training in subject such as physics have increase massively this year but there be more to do include through subject knowledge enhancement which we also want to provide to more teacher in other science subject recognise what the right hon gentleman say about computing it be important to get this right every area where there will be change will be subject to full consultation with expert input computing be one area where we also need to ensure that there be the opportunity to refresh content more regularly give the pace of change we will of course ensure that the qualification be rigorous the right hon gentleman talk about the review and welcome much of professor francis work for which be grateful the review find that the ebacc measure do not translate into increase study of those subject at to and unnecessarily constrain student choice affect student engagement and achievement our revise progress measure will balance strong academic core with breadth and student choice believe that be the right approach but we will consult on the option warmly welcome this curriculum and assessment review and in particular what it say about broad curriculum and the importance of enrichment and essential skill such as digital financial and media literacy and communication will my right hon friend go far and look at introduce skill passport so that young people can have the skill they be learn in school properly recognise for both themselves and employer my hon friend always champion child and young people in his constituency and have lot to offer with his background in education would be happy to discuss his idea far with he be go to leave wide criticism of this review to other as chair of the all party parliamentary group on financial education for young people welcome the recognition of all the lobbying that have go into this review financial education be make statutory requirement at primary school and its position be strengthen at secondary school be good measure the one area where want to push the secretary of state far be on financial education the review make reference to many example of good practice around the country but it stop short of offer idea on how we can continue to progress financial education at time when young people be begin to take financial decision themselves will the secretary of state work with the appg to develop this area far would be keen to hear the hon gentleman idea and those of the all party parliamentary group and thank he for the work he be do in this important area be glad that he welcome many of the change we be set out around financial education note what he have to say about and will make sure that those idea be consider the curriculum and assessment review find that the system have inequality build into it especially for child with special educational need and disability and those from disadvantaged background will the secretary of state set out what intervention will be bring in to provide support and help for those with special educational need and disability and those from disadvantaged background so that they be not leave behind especially during the transition from the current curriculum to the new one my hon friend be right to draw attention to the need to ensure that child with special educational need and disability secure well outcome and have well support through their education and their school life every child in our country deserve the good possible school experience and that be especially true for child with send many of whom do not feel that that be reality and whose parent be really struggle that be why through our school white paper and the wide work we will be take forward around send reform we will ensure that their voice be hear through co creation process as we move to well system of support one where every child in our country can achieve and thrive order we have just minute remain so colleague will have to be brief department for education datum show that only of student retake gcse english or math achieve grade or above this mean that many young people be trap in loop and they often miss the grade by one point what step will the secretary of state take to ensure that student who be unlikely to achieve grade in gcse math and english be offer practical alternative pathway so that they can succeed in these important subject the hon lady be right to raise that point this be an area that the review draw attention to we will develop new to level stepping stone qualification as preparation for gcse for low attainer the review be clear about the importance of gcse english and math and share that view we need to make sure that more young people especially those from disadvantaged background secure strong pass in english and math thank the secretary of state for her statement as former teacher which may have mention few time in this place broadly welcome this curriculum review also welcome the secretary of state commitment to support teacher through this change when the previous government for some random unknown reason decide to change gcse grade from letter to number teacher get very little to no support or resource can the secretary of state guarantee that that will not happen on this occasion and that she will do what she can to support teacher through this change agree we want to make sure that teacher be ready for the new curriculum we will introduce digital version of the national curriculum to support teacher to more easily sequence their school curricula we will also provide high quality free digital resource through oak national academy as well as more curriculum support and continue professional development our rise team will work with school and school leader to drive up standard now for short question masterclass from sir desmond swayne this be education in the cloud when contrast with the reality of war against elitism which be so often actually war against excel ism on the ground be it not no warmly welcome the statement with improved medical care early diagnosis and great awareness more child with special educational need be be identify how will my right hon friend ensure that school have the right environment staff funding and resource for send child to get the most of the positive change in the curriculum we be invest more in our send system and in teacher training and development include new send content for those enter the profession but there be much much more that we need to do as we have discuss in this house on many occasion know that my hon friend care very deeply about improve outcome for child with send and look forward to work with she as we bring forward the school white paper and reform that deliver brilliant experience for child with send throughout our school system we welcome the government ambition to see art and outdoor enrichment education include at the heart of the school curriculum and we have some phenomenal outdoor ed go on in south devon we have long call for broaden ebacc include art subject but without clear incentive to encourage or require their inclusion why will school prioritise these experience for pupil when they be under already severe budgetary pressure from the government many unfunded commitment we be invest more in our school and provide more support to teacher enrichment be important that be why we will develop the framework with expert across education youth service sport and art sector to make it reality encourage the hon lady to look at the proposal we be set out on progress reform because think it will deliver the breadth alongside the academic core that she seek warmly welcome the further support for creative art subject teaching the new national centre and the million for new instrument and much more right hon and hon member with musical background such as the prime minister and know the transformative power of the creative art the soft and hard skill be just as impactful as in other subject can my right hon friend confirm that the government will continue to turn up the volume bang the drum create symphony and maybe even reach the tempo of presto on this issue so that we can finally achieve creative art for all absolutely we be invest through our music hub and the new national centre to make that reality by the end of next year we will have deliver new instrument piece of equipment and other music technology to school to support our young people to pick up instrument and create music later today the government will publish their financial inclusion strategy welcome the step forward for financial literacy will the secretary of state collaborate with the economic secretary and use

skill that sound like wonderful project in my hon friend constituency when our child study history it can often be bring to life by local example that demonstrate wide connection to our nation past but also allow we to shape our future it be in precisely those kind of example where want teacher to have more opportunity to expand child mind and provide they with great opportunity it be welcome news that the government plan that child should be teach critical thinking and how to guard against fake news and misinformation but the secretary of state will be aware that some teacher like some politician regard fake news differently from the rest of society will she ensure that teacher who teach that subject be school in the knowledge of the requirement for political impartiality in school introduce in and carry forward in subsequent legislation the right hon member be right to draw attention to the importance of political impartiality the review find that the current non statutory status of citizenship be lead to uneven and inconsistent progress in the subject there be the chance to do this well to ensure that it be teach well and that young people be able to think critically

secretary of state mention implementation in but that be too slow give the urgency of these problem by that point today year old may be vote in the next election what will she do to speed up implementation of those critical part of the curriculum before then see that there be balance to strike some colleague be rightly urge we to ensure we get the implementation right but understand the hon member impatience to make it happen it be right that we update our curriculum to improve climate and sustainability education in geography science citizenship and design and technology but we do need to ensure that it be do properly of course school will be able to teach the new national curriculum soon if they so choose but do so will not be requirement until welcome professor francis work on the review and the government commitment to uphold many of her recommendation particularly on professional autonomy and digital literacy the review recognise the class attainment gap that be hold back so many working class child what step will my right hon friend take to ensure that the implementation of the curriculum review focus resource on the place that need they most the government be commit to ensure that person background do not determine what they can go on to achieve to take one example from the review it be clear that on leave primary school too many young people do not have the reading and writing skill that they need to succeed later in life and the attainment gap sadly widen throughout their secondary school career we will take action by provide more support around reading include through statutory test in year so that school well identify and target support at the student who have the most to gain that will extend to many disadvantaged child in my hon friend

that the sutton trust be wholeheartedly behind the review will she say little more about the importance of triple science and how she hop that will benefit social mobility across the country my hon friend be right at the moment access to triple science be uneven with big gap in access for disadvantaged student and big geographic inequality it will take time to ensure that we have the subject specialist in place to deliver that but all child in our school should be entitle to do triple science so that they can go on to study the relevant level and level subject there be lot to support in the announcement and particularly welcome the secretary of state word about the importance of financial education from primary onwards if that be do well it could have positive impact on our community for decade to come we all know that the key to great learning be fantastic teaching be in my year as primary school governor so understand why school leader will be question how they can afford to pay for what have be announce from their already stretch budget will the secretary of state assure all the primary schoolchildren in my constituency that there will be enough brilliant teacher on hand who be properly resource to deliver what she have announce know that this can be do only through the amazing work of our teacher our support staff and our school leader we will work with they as we roll out the new national curriculum we be invest more this year and every year in our school we have also deliver two pay award for our teacher this year we have see more secondary and specialist teacher and we be retain more teacher across the board we have achieve lot but there be more to do look forward to work with the hon member on that at recent burton and district chamber of commerce meeting that host business raise the importance of financial education for young people about mortgage saving and pension it appear that the secretary of state be listen what support she will give teacher so that they can deliver that effectively always listen to my hon friend contribution on these important subject give what we have hear from business parent and young people we want to make sure that young people have well grounding in key concept in financial education be that mortgage saving or the difference between debit and credit card something be discuss yesterday with in wide range conversation with group of year student the secretary of state rightly point to the challenge of disinformation challenge that democracy be lose would welcome her agreement that education be our great weapon against disinformation which of her change will ensure that those vote in future general election be well prepared to vote in their interest than those of we who go before as we move towards vote at it will be important that our young people understand our democracy our law our history and their responsibility as active citizen that be why we want to make sure that there be well statutory teaching of citizenship in primary school and improvement at secondary as well there be much brilliant practice already out there but there be more to do to spread it there be lot to welcome in the statement but will the secretary of state please assure and family in st helens north that not only will we have the measure in the curriculum review but more certainty will be provide in the school and send white paper in the new year and that all proposal to help all pupil such as extend continuous provision throughout the whole of key stage will be consider yes in the school white paper we will set out our vision for the school system into the and beyond central part of that will be how we well support child with send so many young people face an adversarial system in which it take too long to get the right support and in which parent have to battle and fight that be why the guide principle behind everything that we do in this area will be well outcome and well life chance for child with send be always willing to discuss with my hon friend the change that he believe be necessary understand history have massive impact on social attitude and people relationship with community will the secretary of state therefore look carefully at the primary school history curriculum to make sure that it include good understanding of global history and the concept behind it as well as big emphasis on local history and local achievement to improve cohesion in our community that way young people grow up will have that great sense of involvement with the rest of the world as well as with their local community high quality history education should allow student to understand both our role in the world and local history there be many powerful example of how learn about local history can really bring topic to life to give one example early this year help unveil statue to woman shipyard worker in sunderland who step in to replace the man who go to the second world war that really bring the topic to life it be fantastic example of how we can combine the local and the national to understand our past and look to the future early this year hold debate on access to sport in school and one of my key point be how vital sport be for child mental health and particularly for build their resilience be pleased that the review recognise that and recommend broaden physical education role to reflect its wide impact on pupil mental and physical health do the secretary of state agree that improve access to sport for all pupil be vital for build resilience in young people especially as we know that there be child who do not have enough access to sport agree that pe and sport be vital element of the rounded and enrich education that every child deserve they can also motivate young people give they sense of purpose help with wellbeing challenge and much more besides that be why we have commit to strengthen the national curriculum for pe and we want to work with many fantastic sporting body and other organisation that deliver enrichment activity through the enrichment framework to deliver that welcome many of the change the government have bring forward the review highlight the attainment gap for people with send at school to close that gap will the secretary of state commit to universal screening for neurodivergence and to more teacher training on the subject for those teach primary school aged child though strengthen the phonic screener be great it be not enough agree about the need to provide well training and support for teacher and support staff that be why this year for the first time there be expand content on send in initial teacher training however there be more to do around teaching training and support for the exist workforce we be consider all that through the school white paper as well as what more we can do to support staff so that they can well identify early need and put in place the require support it will also be important to do that through our best start family hub in which we can work with family at much early stage this review be hugely welcome because it begin to help we address what we have know for long time the creative subject in our school have be in decline that be bad not just for young people but for society and our national life may first urge the secretary of state to learn from this review and implement national centre for art and music education that would be an important intervention from the government secondly on what she say about civic engagement may urge she to go beyond the review recommendation on learn about local history every young person must learn about their locality to build real sense of place and identity my hon friend always champion the importance of music education and the right of every child to access to music our new national centre for art and music education will provide support for school and teacher in deliver the reform curriculum and be delighted that music hub be roll out music instrument tuition and opportunity to take part in music production and creation know that he will continue to champion those thing the secretary of state acknowledge in her statement the progress gap for child with send how will the government support flexibility in the delivery of the curriculum include for those child who be unable to access traditional school setting recognise the challenge and have hear directly from many child and family about the struggle that they face the review look closely at this area understand what the hon lady be say and recognise its importance but alongside that we need to continue to have high expectation of what child with send can achieve with the right level of support through the school white paper we will set out how we make that reality for every child welcome professor francis review on the critical issue of send do my right hon friend agree that the review finding on flexibility time for repetition and revision early identification of need and the role of special educational need and disability co ordinator in ensure an inclusive curriculum could go long way to ensure that school be positive experience for all pupil not just highly academic few we want to build on the review work in this important area and we will set out more detail next year through the school white paper we know that outcome for child with send be not where they need to be parent and family have to battle and it can all be an uphill struggle that be why early identification of need and more support for family as well as well training and support for our staff will be critical element of any reform programme food and farming be almost entirely missing from the national curriculum leave young people with limited understanding of where their food come from or awareness of career opportunity in agriculture and the food system what plan do the secretary of state have to embed agriculture environment and food study into the national curriculum to inspire the next generation to pursue career in those sector the review set out recommend change in number of relate area to those that the hon lady have raise through revise programme of study we will look carefully at how we deliver that there will be opportunity for consultation throughout the process before full national roll out thank the secretary of state for her statement and for her commitment to our young people parent and teacher will know just how gruelle the gcse exam be for our student many of whom be undertake mock as we speak welcome the commitment to work with ofqual to reduce time volume by will the secretary of state outline any other step that have be discuss follow the report about manage the sheer volume of exam that our young people be take the review take an evidence drive approach inform by the datum with input from across the sector and expert to make sure that we get this right however it do not seek to fix thing that be not break recognise that young people in england sit more hour of exam than their peer in many other country we will therefore work closely with ofqual and exam board to reduce gcse exam time by two and half to three hour ofqual be confident that that can be achieve while maintain the integrity and validity of the qualification system on monday enjoy coffee with lovely couple in my constituency who run charity with the goal of deliver book to primary school although digital be often more difficult to read in the sense that it be on screen it can go far fast in reach child especially those who be disadvantaged what consideration have the secretary of state give to the importance of online reading in it will be the national year of reading and in our work on that we be think about not just physical book that can be deliver to child but what strong digital offer could look like encourage the hon gentleman to get involve in that process really welcome the effort to curtail the excessive examination time that our child be face it do not help real learning and be have big impact on the mental health of the young generation what opportunity do the secretary of state see for introduce more modern approach to teaching that offer opportunity to learn through play and would provide wide access to education than traditional method do we want to ensure that as we reduce gcse content by we do so together with the regulator in way that maintain the validity and integrity of the system there be range of different approach that teacher can benefit from and the department provide much in the way of training and development we always keep that under review to ensure that this be evidence inform and drive by the good pedagogy point of

ministers be transparent with the house and seek your guidance thank the hon member for give notice of that point of order have receive no notice that the secretary of state intend to make statement

account show that the depart cabinet secretary and the permanent secretary collectively receive quarter of million pound in golden goodbye ask the minister for the cabinet office the rationale for such use of taxpayer money and the minister without portfolio reply that it be the government policy not to comment on individual that be clearly nonsensical there be clear expectation of accountability and transparency on payment to the most public senior official so do you agree that this approach be in keep with the house resolution on ministerial accountability to parliament thank the hon member for his point of order minister be responsible for their response to member question so that be not matter for the chair but no doubt those on the government front bench will have note his question on point of order madam deputy speaker in the early hour of monday morning there be serious derailment at shap in my constituency on the glasgow to london line it be now wednesday but the secretary of state for transport have choose not to make statement to the house on the matter the derailment shin worrying light on the failure to invest in the modernisation of the railway line north

clarify whether she have see that advice before she decide to label and those who welcome the ban on safety ground as antisemitic can you advise on what step can take to seek redress with an apology or resignation can the hon member confirm that he have actually notify the secretary of state that he intend to raise this matter be not sure well that would be good protocol all correspondence from

bill presented railways presentation and first reading standing order no secretary heidi alexander support by the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer secretary steve reed secretary ed miliband secretary peter kyle secretary douglas alexander secretary jo stevens and james murray present bill to make provision about railway and railway service and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on tuesday november and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en ferry services integration and regulation motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about the integration of ferry service with other transport service to make provision about the regulation of ferry service and for connected purpose our great nation the united kingdom be nation of island this country also invent the railway rail road and ferry together ensure that in every corner of our country there be place that somebody call home there be also political consensus in this country stretch back decade that those who provide public transport do so with certain condition impose upon they that political consensus have exist regardless of who be in government and which party hold power that mean that train operator whether they be soon to be part of the state or private company must provide service for fair price that the government have say over and provide timetabling that allow people to move about regardless of whether that individual train journey be profitable on its own there be law to ensure that those operator must publish performance datum and similar rule apply to bus service provider however there be no national provision that apply to those who operate the ferry service that communitie all over the country whether island community or community that live along riverway rely on for access essential service employment see friend and family and all the thing we do in our daily life that have mean that constituent such as mine on the isle of wight they be just an example be face with huge cost to take car back and forth to the mainland and that who wish to visit the isle of wight sometimes have to pay up to just to take car back and forth on five mile journey private equity group have take control of wightlink and red funnel which operate across the solent and in an entirely unregulated market they can do what they like there be no fair competition because the barrier to enter that market for new provider be simply too high it also mean that what be once half hourly service be now hourly when arrive in southampton last week minute late for red funnel red jet service to cowes have to wait an hour and minute for the next ferry have one of my predecessor andrew turner who be sit in the gallery today do that year ago he would have have to wait only half an hour in too many place in this country ferry service be get bad there be no mandatory reporting requirement on those company either so we have no objective way of tell whether they be provide good service other than the anecdotal evidence that people like present be not look in this bill to put an undue burden on ferry operator quite the opposite be look to end the carve out that they have enjoy for too long carve out that no other public transport provider benefit from if have the owner of wightlink and red funnel in front of now this be what would say to they we be tired of your method tired of your rip off price and tired of fund your huge ballooning bank debt interest you have not do we favour and you be not do we favour you should be provide lifeline transport service which the taxpayer give you money for so that you could stay profitable during covid if those ferry company not just on the isle of wight but across the uk truly believe in quality service for their passenger they would embrace regulation just as other provider do in other mode of public transport too often when my neighbour the hon member for isle of wight west mr quigley or make the argument about expensive ferry price wightlink in particular come back and say well you can cross the solent with we in car for but it fail to admit that that be only if person pay nearly in advance and purchase individual ticket there be not many people live in my constituency who can afford to give the company nearly in advance and who necessarily need to travel time in year ferry company must be straight and not seek to mislead or hoodwink decision maker in this place when other member and talk about how expensive ferry service be it be not just my constituent have have exchange with the leader of the council of the isles of scilly and we both share the view that our constituent be entirely reliant on ferry service for some educational opportunity and essential medical service and for access employment opportunity thing that people on the mainland of the united kingdom take for grant there be no reason why we should be beholden to private profit over and above everyone else present this bill at time when the government be already move in this direction in how they deal with rail and bus while do not necessarily agree with nationalisation and do not agree in the case of the railway agree with the sentiment and the reason why they be present those bills the secretary of state have say that she want to ensure well value for money for passenger to well integrate different mode of transport and to stop profit be priority over passenger experience and connectivity invite she to transfer all that good sentiment she feel about train and bus to ferry too and ensure that community that and other in this place serve be not leave behind thank the minister with responsibility for maritime the hon member for selby keir mather for meet and know that he have meet my neighbour the hon member for isle of wight west urge the minister to continue to work with we to look at solution for my constituent would also like the government to bring in their own regulation for we and to devolve those power to forthcoming mayor if they think it appropriate this bill be about more than just my constituent it be about ensure fair and level playing field across the whole united kingdom question put and agree to order that joe robertson mr richard quigley dame caroline dinenage john cooper rebecca smith darren paffey neil duncan jordan jess brown fuller andrew george siân berry and jim shannon present the bill joe robertson accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be

clause right to guaranteed hour beg to move that this house disagree with the lords in their amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss the follow government motion that this house insist on its disagreement with the lords in their amendment and amendment to do not insist on commons amendment but propose government amendment to in lieu of lords amendment and lords amendment to that this house disagree with lords amendment that this house disagree with lords amendment and but propose government amendment and in lieu that this house insist on its disagreement with the lords in their amendment and but propose government amendment in lieu that this house insist on its disagreement with the lords in their amendment but propose government amendment in lieu be pleased to speak on the employment rights bill for our second consideration of lords amendment and refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests thank my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner for her outstanding work on employment right and her unwavering advocacy for work people know how close this bill be to her heart and be grateful that she be here in support today also thank my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders for his work and dedication on this significant piece of legislation the government top priority be to grow the economy and improve living standard essential to that be the recognition that great productivity security and dignity in work help to grow the economy the strong economic performance that our country need can not be build on the back of people in insecure work for too long employment law have fail to keep pace with the fundamental change to how when and where we work it be time to build modern industrial relation framework fashion on the principle of social partnership that consent and consensus must replace dispute and conflict in modern employment relation that be good for worker and good for business both suffer when one employer be undercut by another use reduced term and condition of service for their employee sustainable economic growth can not be build on unfair competition and insecure employment the employment rights bill extend the employment protection currently enjoy by some employee in the good british company to worker across the country by do so work will become more secure and predictable while strengthen the foundation that underpin modern economy the bill will back business that already do the right thing and give hard work people the job security and opportunity they deserve it be in tune with the time and in keep with how the world of work be change industrial relation law in this country must move from the century to the it have to recognise that certainty and security be essential for people at work that the good relationship between employer and employee be well exemplify by fairness and trust within framework for recruitment and retention that value both and that dignity at work be as vital to the effective functioning of modern society as the dignity of work some will seek to use this issue to entrench the idea that employer and employee have oppose interest that must always inevitably result in dispute and strife and reject that view the very good trade unionist know as do the good employer that such view only represent failure for this labour government success be to be measure not in division but in the share economic growth that we achieve the opportunity and security we build and the prosperity we create and that be at the heart of the bill today ask the house to reaffirm its support for this important legislation as we move through the late round of parliamentary ping pong we have listen carefully to the concern that have be raise and in response we be offer where possible amendment in lieu that we believe strike fair and workable compromise with the propose amendment although we appreciate the range of perspective offer we will be unable to support certain amendment that conflict with the fundamental principle of the bill and may compromise its intended impact we acknowledge that lords amendment which relate to zero hour contract be an amendment in lieu intend as compromise it propose shift from full right to request model to one in which employer must notify worker of their right to guarantee hour offer and make guarantee hour offer unless the worker decline or opt out appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment but it would undermine the bill core aim of end exploitative contract and provide security for the worker who need it most we therefore can not accept it the government be commit to end one sided flexibility so that worker be not leave guess about their hour or pay these reform reward fair employer modernise the system and come with clear guidance to help everyone prepare for employer clear expectation mean well staffing and low recruitment cost through well retention we also appreciate that some group include young worker value the flexibility of zero hour contract that be why worker will be able to decline guarantee hour offer and remain on their exist arrangement if that work well for they the government be also commit to support young people into work the youth guarantee will include targeted backstop under which every eligible and unemployed young person on universal credit for month without earn or learning will be provide guarantee pay work the scheme form part of the government aim to provide target support for young people at risk of long term unemployment further detail will be confirm at the autumn budget follow further engagement include with employer let turn to lords amendment on seasonal work the government recognise that work in certain sector fluctuate seasonally and that there be way in which employer may account for that and remain compliant with the legislation they may for example use annualise hour contract which offer variable number of hour at work at different time of the year additionally the bill already allow guarantee hour offer to take the form of limited term contract where reasonable for example fruit picker could be engage on contract tie to the end of the picking season in such case after the initial reference period the employer would be require to guarantee hour only for the duration of that limit term contract rather than on permanent basis the bill also already provide power to address seasonal work through regulation ensure flexibility as workforce need evolve consultation with employer trade union and stakeholder will take place before such regulation be make we therefore do not support the amendment let turn to unfair dismissal lord amendment and to propose retain qualifying period of six month for unfair dismissal these amendment have return to this house as the lords have insist on they we remain committed to deliver unfair dismissal protection from day one not two year not six month but day one that be clear pledge in our manifesto and it will ensure that about million employee who have work for their employer for less than two year be protect from be arbitrarily fire crucially day one protection from unfair dismissal will not remove the right of business to dismiss people who can not do their job or do not pass probation but it will tackle case of unfair dismissal in which hard work employee be sack without good reason six month qualifying threshold still leave employee expose to dismissal without good reason in the early month of new job which be why the government can not accept the lords amendment on maintain qualifying period do the minister not listen to the voice of business and business organisation they say that what the government propose will make young people whom it be risky to take on less likely to get job in the first place why do she think she know well than employer and the people who create job in this country yesterday be with the hospitality sector council hear about all the brilliant work it do to provide employment opportunity for young people across the country indeed my first job be in café such opportunity to get on the employment ladder be significant for young people that be why the bill will work in alignment with all the other crucial work that the government be do through the youth guarantee as have outline on unfair dismissal it simply be not fair that hard work employee who have work somewhere for month can be unfairly dismiss and have no stability and predictability in their job protection through day one right give financial security to people who do not have it we be strike balanced approach by introduce statutory probation period as we have mention the government preference be for that to be period of nine month but we be engage in consultation on the next step for those light touch standard the probation period will ensure that in the early month of employment employer can dismiss employee who might not be perform or might not be suitable the measure will tackle the cause of unfair dismissal some of employer support give employee protection from unfair dismissal the day one right accord to the institute for public policy research and tuc research and of manager agree that improved worker right can and do positively impact on workplace productivity do my hon friend agree that we should listen to that extremely important research my hon friend raise an excellent point about research provide employee with security at work result in happy workforce which increase productivity and help business across the country as well as our economy the bill will provide flexibility and security for people in workplace across the country which be vital for our productivity that be our vision for our country and economy the minister refer to nine month probationary period as oppose to the six month unfair dismissal period report from the resolution foundation which be usually hold in high regard on the treasury bench say that this be messy compromise that risk confuse employer and prevent they from take people on that be the point that be make some of job in my constituency be in the hospitality sector the sector be not take people on because of the job tax and it will take on even few people because of these increase cost do she not realise the confusion that will come from this messy probation period which be not on the face of the bill as we have say from the start the implementation of day one unfair dismissal right will be do with light touch be keen to work with employer across the country include in the hospitality sector which play key role in employ and provide opportunity for young people will work with all stakeholder on the next step and implementation as the hon gentleman know and as be the case for lot of employment right legislation we be set the foundation here in this crucial bill but there be lot of detail to work through in consultation which be absolutely committed to do the framework will be found on the principle of social partnership consent and consensus must replace dispute and conflict in modern employment relation that will ensure maximum flexibility so that the new framework work effectively for employer and employee in each sector of the economy we will minimise the cost of its implementation and operation the government be commit to ensure that employer can hire with confidence as have say introduce the statutory probation period enable employer to fairly assess new hire performance and suitability for the role that they have be hire for most employer already use contractual probation period of six month or less the government have be clear that our preference be for the probationary period to be nine month long that would allow for standard six month term with the option to extend support employee development without compromise operational need we have hear the call to ensure that the framework reflect real world reality and we have table an amendment in lieu to address that our amendment place statutory duty on the government to consult on key aspect of the framework that would guarantee meaningful input from employer and employee give business direct role in shape the legislation to ensure practical and fair approach additionally we be table further amendment in lieu make technical change to the word restore to the bill by our rejection of the lords amendment do my hon friend agree that the bill not only provide vital protection to the workforce but give business the certainty they need to grow our economy completely agree we be create security for people across the country crucially we be ensure that employer do the right thing for their employee and go above and beyond the proposal in the bill that ensure level playing field which be good for our economy and for business that might otherwise be undercut by other that do not play by the rule we have also hear concern about the pressure on the employment tribunal system we will set up taskforce to support we in fix the employment dispute system so that it work well for worker and business the taskforce will have balance representation from union business and other expert include community organisation turn now to the lords amendment on heritage rail the government agree with the principle of the amendment and have table an amendment in lieu that capture the intent while refine the drafting to provide more clarity and ensure that the legislation work as intend the government amendment which have be table with the support of sponsor peer lord parkinson and lord faulkner place statutory duty on the office of rail and road and the health and safety executive to produce guidance support to year old who volunteer on heritage railway rise as co chair alongside lord faulkner of the all party parliamentary group on heritage rail express my thank to the government for bring forward the amendment and recognise that volunteer with heritage railway be an immensely useful experience for young people age to be glad that we be now undertake month assessment for guidance thank the right hon member for work with we and for her support throughout the passage of the bill understand her passion and work in this area as she say the guidance will offer clear benchmark for reasonable activity and assist inspector in important decision the government be commit to the work as she will know with publication target by march we believe that this collaborative effort will provide practical guidance that empower child to engage safely and meaningfully in heritage railway volunteering turn to the issue of political fund lords amendment and would remove clause from the bill that clause reverse measure in the trade union act which we have commit to repeal that require member to opt in to political fund this therefore reinstate longstanding arrangement where member be automatically include unless they choose to opt out remove clause would break that commitment to restore balance and fairness in union operation the opt in system introduce in add bureaucracy without improve transparency or strengthen member choice to be clear we be not remove that choice at the point of join every new member will be clearly inform on the application form that they have the right to opt out of contribute to political fund the same form will make it plain that opt out have no negative bearing whatsoever on any other aspect of union membership that be why the government can not support lords amendment and we have hear reflection around how opt out notice would take effect and have table an amendment in lieu to refine that process under the legislation an opt out notice be effective on january follow the year in which it be give under the government amendment opt out notice will now have effect from either january or the follow year after it have be provide or on date specify or determine in the rule of the union whichever of those date come first this provide union with flexibility in the legislation to act more quickly and process the member request to opt out without have to wait until the subsequent january to do so in practice union already do this we will also commit today to engage with union directly to continue to make clear our expectation that opt out notice can be honour as swiftly and practically as possible our amendment be simply about ensure that legislation match what have be the establish practice hope that the minister have not refer to this already but small business in my constituency that do not have human resource department tell that they will find it hard to navigate these legislative water although we need strong employment right and support the bill objective we need to ensure that there be support for employer so that they know how to implement the measure and how to defend themselves which they will sometimes need to do without pay costly solicitor bill that be detrimental to their business will the minister reassure on that matter come from family that have business in the hospitality sector which be close to my heart in the first eight week that have be in this role have have the pleasure to meet small and large business and have make clear our determination to work closely with they on the implementation of this legislation and to ensure that they be prepare for the change when they come we publish our road map early this year and have commit to stick to that which have be welcome by business small and large finally turn to the issue of industrial action ballot threshold lords amendment would remove clause from the bill which would retain the exist turnout threshold for industrial action ballot the government do not support this amendment clause remove an unnecessary bureaucratic hurdle and align union democracy with other democratic process such as parliamentary vote and local election which do not typically require turnout threshold but be still accept as legitimate as the period of disruption under the conservatives watch between and have show bureaucratic hurdle only make it hard for union to engage in the bargaining and negotiation that settle dispute this government approach will foster new partnership of co operation between trade union and employer if this provision be introduce do the minister think that there will be more or few strike strike be failure of the tory government who have stop listen and to be frank have stop work so will not be take any further intervention from the hon gentleman we want to create modern and positive framework for trade union legislation that deliver productive and constructive engagement respect the democratic mandate of union and work to reset our industrial relation nonetheless we recognise that this issue have generate debate which be why the government have table an amendment in lieu that will require the secretary of state to have regard to any effect of the introduction of electronic balloting on the proportion of those entitle to vote in industrial action ballot who actually do so we have previously commit to align the removal of the threshold with the establishment of balloting as an option for trade union this amendment give statutory effect to that commitment and make it explicit in the underlying legislation in have regard to the effect of balloting the government will monitor and assess the practical impact of balloting on participant rate and the threshold to conclude urge hon member to support the government motion before the house today include our amendment in lieu which be part of package that strengthen right and reflect the value we place on fair work we have listen throughout the bill passage and make meaningful change where need and we will continue to listen to all relevant stakeholder as we move into implementation we be committed to full and comprehensive consultation with employer worker trade union and civil society as set out in our implement the employment rights bill road map we be take phased approach to engagement and consultation on these reform this will ensure that stakeholder have the time and space to work through the detail of each measure and will help we to implement each in the interest of all this be win win for employer employee and more competitive british economy act in haste repent at leisure never have that be wise advice than in respect of this bill it be rushed bill that be half baked when it be introduce and have get bad since it have fail every test of scrutiny from the lords delegated powers and regulatory reform committee to the constitution committee to its low ball impact assessment on the day that the mayfield report outline the scale of the challenge that we face on worklessness it will create generation jobless every family in the country will know son daughter niece or nephew who can not get work as result as my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith remind we every labour government leave unemployment higher than when they start but only this government have actually legislate for that the minister ask we to disagree with all the main compromise amendment from the other place if she wish to listen to stakeholder now would be fantastic moment to start her motion to disagree reject sensible compromise on qualifying period seasonal working guarantee hour strike threshold and opt in to political fund who will be the victim if the motion be carry today young people the neurodiverse those with disability female returner to work the over and former prisoner some of the most vulnerable group in society who deserve their chance in life their shot at employment and job yesterday the hon gentleman say the conservatives will repeal those most damaging element of the employment rights report november vol could he inform we which element of the bill they will retain we will have our work cut out with its page and labour member seek to hide behind measure that we support such as enhance maternity right but will the hon member tell how many time the word maternity appear in the bill and how many time the word paymaster appear in it do not realise that be genuine offer do not have the function in front of to do word count but again would be interested in hear an answer to the question pose to the hon gentleman all will say be that as his colleague the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith say in committee trade union associate mp have be assiduous at declare donation think only one member on the conservative side have declare an interest throughout all these proceeding find that utterly incredible trust that you will want all member this afternoon to declare any relevant interest madam deputy speaker and have none to answer the question that the hon gentleman do not manage to answer the word maternity appear in this bill three time the word union appear in this bill time follow the money madam deputy speaker with unemployment higher every listen and learn this will be labour legacy with unemployment higher every month of this government it be bleak time for those try to find work the independent office for national statistics estimate that vacancy be down by since this government come into office some of those graduate in be not in full time work month later and it be estimate that almost half the top uk employer have reduce their graduate intake in fact graduate be compete for so few job that get job be as improbable as spot labour member who have not receive union donation but it be not just graduate for many seasonal work be the first opportunity to get foot on the career ladder yet this bill in its current form force hospitality business or anyone who rely on seasonal worker into an impossible position that be why we be supportive of the lords compromise amendment that would allow employer who need flexibility across the calendar year to continue to have it what could be so objectionable about that refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the hon gentleman be talk about seasonal work but have he think about the impact on young people of so call zero hour contract and the pressure that put on their be able to live decent life and plan for the future be at conference last week about mental health in the workplace which opposition member be concerned about zero hour contract and flexible working be really difficult for young people and we must address their concern as well mental health be huge issue across the house we would agree on that and the mayfield report this morning be just one of many contribution to the debate but for so many this go to reform of our welfare system as well the right answer will be to be in employment and the mayfield report talk about create barrier to employer give young people chance there will of course be some challenge with any form of contract employment include zero hour which many find very flexible way of combine work with study and parental or other responsibility the way to try to solve that challenge across this house be not the clunk fist of regulation dictate and provide perverse incentive and maybe unintended consequence which mean that employer do not take chance at all on young people and they do not get that first step on the employment ladder understand that the hon lady concern and contribution be well mean but that be why it would be so much well if we approach the bill collectively after so many hour of debate in committee in this place and in the other place and if the government show compromise to help mitigate not shelve the bill as might prefer some of the bad damage that will manifest itself in few job few opportunity and some of the most vulnerable finding it very hard to get into work employer face the prospect of hire go wrong when they take chance or risk and of an employee be able to turn up in the morning on day one and before lunch file claim with the employment tribunal that put their business at the back of two year long queue behind open claim it be staggering that we have be talk about this bill when the queue for the tribunal in many part of the country stretch out for two year that be incredibly expensive and justice defer be justice for nobody why not focus much more of our endeavour on try to fix that issue would be very happy to be intervene on if there be any real business group not the institute for public policy research or the tuc but real business group that the minister or anyone else would like to cite in defence of this bill and that support it in its current form be all ear because that be not true of the federation of small businesses the british chambers of commerce the confederation of british industry make uk the institute of directors ukhospitality the british retail consortium and so many more the answer to that question be the chartered management institute well be glad we have find one have not have any representation from it the shadow secretary of state be show how much he despise the trade union movement and ordinary working order must declare financial interest with regard to my connection with the trade union movement be very proud member of trade union in response to what the shadow secretary of state say about support for the employment rights bill it be manifesto pledge and the british public vote in their million to support the labour party to put this manifesto pledge through in its entirety and guess what that be what we be do ask the member strongly to withdraw that do not despise trade union not single word have ever say at the dispatch box indicate anything of the sort and would ask you madam deputy speaker to get the member to withdraw that comment as it be not worthy of he would have hop for well form in the conduct of this debate support people right to trade union well regulate trade union for year the labour party accept broad consensus on the balance between the right of worker and the right of employer tony blair never seek at any point to reopen the consensus on that balance that have serve this country well and it do no one service to render people unemployed rise should give way to the hon member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders who do so much service on this bill be grateful to the shadow secretary of state for give way be pleased that he have learn to count now he must have improve his skill since his time under liz truss in the treasury he talk about the consensus over year but be it not his government who introduce the trade union act which do so much to damage trade union relation be try to be generous to the hon member as this bill be part of his legacy before he be so rudely fire by bad boss without any notice it be not unreasonable to say that strike must be support by mere quarter of worker in order to be valid do not think the labour party would claim the mandate that the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery be talk about on the vote of merely quarter the hon member be not be very clear do he like the trade union regime which be the one this bill take we back to or do he like the trade union regime which be the one he seem to be advocate except when he talk about the year of settle consensus which be it because it can not be both we on the conservative benches seek to respect the role of trade union but in flexible workplace where we see growth in the economy and unlike what we see today more people in job rather than few people in job that do not help anybody at all least of all government who claim that their no obsession be growth that be not an unreasonable position not for the first time think minister have get themselves in bind the secretary of state for business and trade be go around tell business group that he be listen but every one of they be against this bill from what the health secretary have be say privately it be clear that he be no fan of give more power to militant union to call low turnout strike the welfare secretary have commission report on get people from welfare into work and those report talk about not disincentivise employer from hire be treasury ministers really look forward to the office for budget responsibility next week score the impact of this bill give the independent estimate that it could shave up to off gdp the chancellor like to blame everyone from the dinosaur onwards for her failure but this one will definitely be on she the loom disaster of this bill be the truth that dare not speak its name it may be triumph for the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner but it be disaster for britain it be bad for business bad for growth and bad for job far from further worker right it punish those who want job we do not protect worker by bankrupt their employer even the government ally be warn they against this bill government members have choice they can stand by and watch as their government bring into law decade worth of economic stagnation or they can be on the side of the young the vulnerable and the enterprising history will remember this moment because when unemployment skyrocket business shut their door and young people stop believe and stop hop no one on the government benches will be able to say that they be not warn refer hon member to my entry in the register of members financial interests be proud to declare an interest as lifelong trade unionist in the labour movement which have help to get where be today let start by place on record my thank to my right hon friend the member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders and all those colleague in the other place who spend so many late night work on this bill welcome my hon friend the member for halifax kate dearden to the front bench she be among the many trade union leader who help to develop this bill before it come to this place the shadow secretary of state think that the bill be cook up on the back of fag packet but it take year and million of union member and ordinary people in this country who have face decimation since the conservatives bill in offer my support to my hon friend the member for halifax in finish her job because the house will know that this bill be unfinished business start my work life as carer on casual term not know if there be go to be pay cheque from month to month it be because of good unionised job with decent condition that my life and the life of the worker represent change as tour the country in the election campaign in every community hear from so many who be in the same position they want change they want fairness and they want respect at work that be why when we promise to deliver the big upgrade to worker right in generation we mean it it be very clear from the shadow secretary of state opening remark and from what he say as the bill pass through the house that the conservatives do not want to improve work people life in fact it be very clear from his submission today let we face it that he want to water the bill down when he mention the state of tribunal nearly fall off my chair can not believe he can say that with straight face after the state in which the conservatives leave our justice system will even talk about the economic mess they leave we in despite the fierce criticism from opposition party and the relentless lobbying from vested interest be proud to speak in this debate as we deliver nothing less than new deal for work people every time we have make progress on employment right over the last year it have be resist it be always easy to do nothing to take the path of least resistance but in each generation it have be the labour party that have have the courage and conviction to change life maternity allowance equal pay for woman health and safety right the minimum wage labour change life and this generation be no different this bill show that labour be on the side of work people they will know that ordinary people be well off and it will have an effect on their family their child their brother and their sister they will have basic right from day one such as protection from unfair dismissal can not believe the conservative party think that in this day and age we should dismiss people unfairly do not understand it we be go to strengthen sick pay family right bereavement leave and protection from sexual harassment at work we will have ban on zero hour contract historic fair pay agreement in social care an end to fire and rehire genuine living wage and the single big boost to right at work in generation create an economy that work for work people that be the promise we make to the british public and urge the secretary of state to fight every step of the way to deliver it in full the public have no patience for the tory and lib dem lord who cheer on by reform be stand in the way of well right for worker and frustrating what be clear manifesto promise tonight this house will once again send the message that we will not back down will not go through every lords amendment but will pick out couple of the most damaging first lords amendment and lords amendment to would break the pledge that we make to the british people to give they day one right the last conservative government shamefully double the qualification period against unfair dismissal to two year and strip worker of protection at the stroke of pen and now they be at it again government member believe that worker deserve fairness dignity and respect at work and they deserve it from day one on the job opposition member say that these right against unfair dismissal will slow down hire so let be clear that employer can absolutely still have probation period for their new staff they just will not be able to fire they unfairly at will for no good reason secondly lords amendment would tear up protection for worker on zero hour contract this government make commitment to provide worker with an offer of guarantee hour and the lords amendment would water down that right we promise to ban zero hour contract no ifs no but and that be exactly what we should do this bill be promise we make to the british public it be our duty to deliver it and say to my front bench colleague that will be with they every step of the way as we do just that make no mistake the bill be good for worker and good for business it be not just the right thing to do it be the foundation for the high growth high skill economy that the uk need its key measure be back by many of britain good business include the co op centrica and richer sounds those business prove that if you treat people well you get the good out of they they know that be pro worker be not barrier to success but launchpad to it that be why the bill take the very good standard from the very good business and extend they to million of worker it be also why we say proudly that this be pro business and pro worker bill respected business voice such as the chartered management institute have indicate their support for the key measure in the bill we will continue to consult business and hear their voice to make sure that we get the detail right we talk lot about growth in this place but as the result from new york overnight show growth mean nothing if ordinary people can not see it and if community have nothing to show for it the reform we be make today will give people security and dignity that they can feel they will mean something to the thousand of pregnant woman and mother who will benefit from new maternity protection the ten of thousand of father and partner who will be bring into the scope of paternity leave the million who will benefit from new policy on flexible working the million who will receive right to bereavement leave the up to million employee who will benefit from protection from unfair dismissal from day one and the million people in every corner of this country who will benefit from labour plan across this country people will benefit from secure work and decent wage that they can raise family on this bill be once in generation chance to reshape the world of work to drive race to the top on standard achieve real growth and build an economy that work for everyone call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be real pleasure to follow the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner and hear her passionate advocacy for this bill the liberal democrats support many of the principle of this bill we have long advocate for strengthen employment right in several way include by increase support for carer boost statutory sick pay and give people on zero hour contract more certainty about their work pattern there be lot in the bill that we support in principle and that move we in the right direction but we remain concerned about the specific way in which the government plan to implement many of its measure so much of the detail that should have be in the bill have be leave to secondary legislation or future consultation make it impossible for business to plan ahead with certainty for that reason we support amendment that provide clarity for business for example by set the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claim at six month training hire and retain skilled workforce be issue that affect business across the country and we must ensure that this legislation strike the right balance for both employee and business do the hon member believe that in the first six month of employment it be appropriate for people to be dismiss for unfair reason and without fair process the point have be make on number of occasion that it be always possible for employer to make mistake in their hiring for people to not be the right fit for the job there should be straightforward way for those employer to dismiss those people without be challenge on the basis that the dismissal be unfair the key point be not that employer should be allow to make unfair dismissal but if dismissal have be fair they should not have to defend it the liberal democrat spokesperson have just say that it be not right that employer should pay for mistake they make in hire someone why should the employee pay for that mistake if it be not theirs there be balance between the employer and the employee if the fit be not right it be well for both side that the employment be bring to an end and that the employee be free to seek more appropriate employment there be very significant concern the lack of clarity about probation period which the minister mention and exactly what they mean risk pile undue worry on to business manager who be struggle to find the right skill we can compare that with the provision in the amendment table on unfair dismissal my liberal democrat colleague and both here and in the other place have be clear in our support for an amendment that would change the obligation to offer guarantee hour to right to request guarantee hour amendment would allow an employee to notify their employer if they no long wish to receive guarantee hour offer but they would be able to opt back into receive guarantee hour offer at any time that reasonable and balanced approach would relieve employer from have to issue guarantee hour offer each reference period to worker who may simply not be interested in they while ensure that those who wish to receive such offer could continue to do so the liberal democrats strongly believe in give zero hour worker security about their working pattern and we be deeply concerned that too many worker be struggle with unstable income job insecurity and difficulty in planning for the future however we also recognise that many people value the flexibility that such arrangement provide adaptability in shift pattern be often hugely valuable for those balance care responsibility or their study alongside work it be therefore important to strike balance that ensure that worker can have both security and flexibility specifically small and medium sized business have highlight that have to offer employee fix hour contract on rolling basis could impose significant cost and administrative burden on their limited resource compound other challenge such as the recent increase in employer national insurance contribution and the fallout from the previous government damage brexit deal the liberal democrat amendment that be debate in the lords be in line with our long stand policy that zero hour and agency worker should have the right to request fix hour contract request that employer could not unreasonably refuse we believe that measure would maintain valuable flexibility and benefit both party when the obligation to keep offer guarantee hour even to worker who clearly be not interested in they impose significant burden that do not benefit either side as with all workplace right employee should be support to exercise right to request guarantee hour without fear of any negative consequence in their workplace the unified fair work agency be set up by the government which we welcome could help ensure that employee receive that protection and support this approach would still give worker the vital security that they deserve while avoid unnecessary burden for employer last time the bill be debate in the commons speak in favour of measure that would improve the clarity of the legislation on seasonal work so will once again speak in favour of lords amendment the sustainability of so many company such as farming business depend on get the right people into the right place at the right time any obstacle to action that can have huge impact on company operation potentially throw the entire business into jeopardy hospitality firm such as pub cafés and restaurant also rely on seasonal worker and be particularly vulnerable can the hon lady define what right somebody work behind desk in this place should have under amendment that somebody work behind bar in this place should not they be different kind of work with different work pattern require different skill and experience be not entirely certain what point the hon member want to respond to if different regulatory framework be to apply to seasonal work clear definition of seasonal work must be create to prevent employer from avoid their legitimate responsibility by claim employee as seasonal worker in inappropriate circumstance we continue to call for business that be especially reliant on seasonal worker to be properly consider when secondary legislation be create so urge member to support amendment on trade union again speak in favour of lords amendment to maintain the status quo in which ballot threshold be require for industrial action the government proposal to remove the threshold entirely mean that trade union could take strike action with only small minority of eligible member take part in the vote that be bind to raise question among the public about whether the will of worker have be accurately represent and it risk unnecessarily create tension between worker employee and the general public that would not be good outcome for any of the party involve we should maintain robust process for launch industrial action will the hon lady inform the house of the statistic relate to her election at the general election she be elect by minority if it be good enough for she she be do great job by the way why be it not good enough for ordinary work people the hon gentleman will be happy to hear that of richmond park voter vote for to be their representative so be in fact elect by the majority of my constituent be delighted to hear that he think be do good job for they think he be attempt to highlight that many of the people in the chamber be elect on less than the first thing would say to that be that on most ballot paper there will have be choice of more than two candidate will the hon lady give way may finish the point if people be choose from list of five people it be likely under the first past the post system that the win candidate will receive less than of the vote in strike ballot the choice be between two option that be why there should be more than of all member vote for the option to strike that be the important point here secondly the hon gentleman have give an excellent opportunity to point out that the liberal democrats have long be advocate of voting reform last december introduce ten minute rule bill advocate for proportional representation which be pass it remain the will of the house as express on that occasion that we should change the way in which we elect hon member maintain robust process for launch industrial action be particularly important when we consider the scale of the disruption that the public face when strike happen the liberal democrats also continue to support measure that would retain the current opt in system for contribution to trade union political fund amendment maximise choice and transparency for individual about the political fund to which they be contribute most employer be responsible business that want to do the right thing by their staff many of whom support the bill aim but they have significant concern about the extent of the bill much of which be still undecided on and risk compound other challenge that they face change in employer national insurance slow progress on reform of the apprenticeship levy and the absence of any meaningful action to bring down commercial energy price continue to be extremely damaging to business and to our economy as whole we must find way to support small and medium sized business in particular and to provide clarity so that they can plan ahead if the government be prepared to make meaningful improvement to the bill that would make thing easy for small business for example through the amendment suggest by the liberal democrats they might find it easy to make progress with the legislation we support many of the aim of the bill and the spirit of the measure that strengthen employment right but urge member to support our amendment which will help to ensure that this legislation strike the right balance for both worker and business rise call justin madders after his speech there will be five minute speaking limit for back benchers let first draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests which refer to an election donation from the union of shop distributive and allied workers and to my membership of the unite and gmb trade union it be nearly nine month since the bill complete its commons stage and over year since it be first introduce so it be disappointing to see yet another delay know that many of my constituent would want these vital manifesto commitment to be enact as soon as possible but recent proceeding in the other place have demonstrate the intention of the opposition party to elongate the process and attempt to water down important protection that the bill offer to worker it be as simple as this labour members be elect on manifesto that commit we to make work pay and the employment rights bill be central to deliver that it will be the big upgrade of worker right in generation it be long overdue and we will all be unashamed of our commitment to improve the life of work people this bill will have transformative impact on the world of work and particularly on people who lack job security and dignity make no mistake at every single stage the conservatives and reform have vote to water the bill down or weaken its protection and now it seem that the liberal democrats have join in our constituent will no doubt conclude that those on the opposition benches be side with the bad boss and urge they to reconsider and choose the side of work people that be not an exaggeration because the lords amendment under consideration will gut the bill of important protection for the million of people currently in insecure work we do not have much time so will focus on lords amendment and and lords reason which consider to be the most damaging amendment lord amendment represent continued attempt to undermine our commitment to ban exploitative zero hour contract the government and labour members have always be clear that the only way to tackle the most pernicious element of such contract be to make the right to guarantee hour right that people can genuinely exercise worker on zero hour contract be some of the least empower in our economy and the least able to actively assert their right their work hour be inherently precarious and often depend on the vagary of their boss and they be more likely to be young and work in the lowest pay sector of the economy shift this commitment to right to request model as the liberal democrat amendment suggest would completely fail to recognise the power imbalance in the work relationship and the real risk that assertion of right would have negative consequence for those who just want some basic security and dignity at work be therefore pleased that we be reject those amendment of course that be not the only form of insecurity that those on the opposition benches want to keep on the table as they support lords reason which seek to allow worker to be unfairly dismiss in the first six month of their employment maybe those in the other place who have job for life do not understand what it feel like to be toss aside without any explanation maybe they do not appreciate how debilitate it can be for someone to go into work every day with the sword of damocles hang over their head know that if the chop come there will be absolutely nothing that they can do about it but those bill will still need pay and their dependant will still depend on they we need to drive out the insecurity that eat away at so many hard work people in this country do not agree with opposition members who protest that our change would overnight put stop to hire the government have be clear that employer will be able to pursue light touch dismissal process within probationary period and have rightly commit to consult closely with employer on the implementation of that we often hear we do again today regard employer organisation how it be not right that employer should pay the price for make mistake when hire someone but why should the employee why should someone who may have give up perfectly good job to take on another bear all the risk and the consequence if an employer do not get their hiring practice right the liberal democrats in their response talk about this be need to strike balance but think the proposal for statutory probation period actually do strike the right balance and deliver fairness to both the employee and the employer opposition members have also gleefully reference recent report by the resolution foundation on this issue the shadow secretary of state the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith have be generous to but will have to pull he up on something that he say in yesterday opposition day debate that the resolution foundation actually oppose this bill well be afraid that show that he simply have not read the report because it say in black and white at the top of the first page the government employment rights bill be important and welcome accept that it then go on to argue against day one right but the only statistical evidence it put up in respect of that be chart compare we to other country and say that we currently have some of the weak protection against dismissal and that this bill will give we some of the strong well that be the actual point of this bill and do not think it be compelling argument to say that it be something we do not want to see deliver be it not also the case that within that graph number of the nation that the resolution foundation say have weak protection actually have high unemployment rate than our own there be clearly not the relationship between the two that some in the opposition have try to suggest my hon friend be absolutely right indeed that be something that the resolution foundation say when give evidence to the bill committee will quote that directly internationally we can draw scatter plot of the employment level in country and the extent of employment regulation and basically those line come out flat you have some country with very high employment and very high level of regulation and some country with low employment and high report employment rights public bill committee november so there be no clear relationship with the employment level across country that be confirm by the oecd which have do lot of detailed work that be what the resolution foundation say in its evidence to the bill committee last year would the hon member like to put his money where his mouth be and tell we whether his faith in the employment rights bill be such that he be prepared to make commitment to his constituent in ellesmere port and bromborough that if have pass this bill unemployment go up he will resign his seat absolutely can not believe that the conservative party which see massive increase in unemployment in my constituency in the and when they be in power have the cheek to start talk about the effect of unemployment on my constituent now the resolution foundation have say some thing in recent week that do not agree with but it have say thing in the past that be much more in line with what we believe the international evidence show so the kind thing can say about the resolution foundation be that prefer its early work turn to government amendment in lieu of lords amendment on repeal of the last remnant of the trade union act and the removal of threshold for industrial action ballot have always hold the view that the introduction of balloting if do properly will lead to much great participation in ballot and render argument about turnout obsolete the implementation timetable that the government publish indicate that balloting will begin next april hope that the minister when she respond can provide some reassurance that that be still on track and that we can therefore expect the end of threshold to come at the same time or very shortly thereafter would be disappoint if the amendment be an attempt to kick this issue into the long grass be not particularly keen on the conditionality in the amendment which talk about whether to repeal the threshold there should be no question of whether it should be about when after all that be what we promise to do in our manifesto urge the minister to resist any temptation to introduce any conditionality and to deliver the make work pay agenda in full as we say we would will conclude because be conscious that number of members wish to speak be proud that the government be continue to commit to implement this bill in full the policy in the bill be overwhelmingly popular with the public they form key part of our manifesto and remain central to the government plan for change we on the labour benches proudly stand against those who seek to water down this bill and hamper its implementation we be proud to back worker and to deliver meaningful change in their work life we stand against maintain the status quo of low pay low security and little dignity at work and we stand for job security and for deliver on our promise wish to draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests my proud year in unite and the generous support from the million of ordinary member of the gmb and aslef in pay into their political fund to put representative of the work class here in parliament be here to deliver simple but firm message there will be no concession on this bill not one opposition party in the house of lords be try to water down the right that work people vote for but we will stand firm the new deal for work people be labour manifesto commitment and it will be deliver in full want to talk about two set of amendment start with lords amendment and on political fund the lords want to keep the opt in system but it be abundantly clear that this be deliberate attack on the political voice of work people all this bill do be restore the long stand opt out system that have last since union member will still have robust right and they can opt out easily union be tightly regulate no other membership organisation have face these rule union political spending be transparent and accountable with annual return to the certification officer and the electoral commission regulating donation and campaigning of course these political fund support wide campaigning not just party donation although be proud to say that they support party donation too also oppose lords amendment on keep the unnecessary and unneeded ballot threshold which be design to stop worker have voice the tory and lib dem lords want to reinstate the turnout threshold that be introduce by the draconian trade union act remind member from the liberal democrat party that they oppose that act in include the ballot threshold and wonder why they have now reverse their position ballot threshold weaken union and stall negotiation before ballot trigger talk and resolve dispute early now the threshold delay dialogue and make resolution hard no other organisation face turnout threshold this just single out union of course anyone who be familiar with how the trade union movement work know that no union would call member out on strike if they be not up for it with all due thank and respect to the other place we will still repeal the trade union act in full with no concession this bill be the first step in deliver the new deal for work people our promise to the work people of this country this be the change that work people vote for the government will not give in to unelected tory and lib dem lords side with bad boss to weaken worker right not now not today not ever draw hon member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests in relation to support from trade union of which be most proud the past four decade of structural decline in the share of the national income go to employee decade mark by the erosion of trade union right have be exacerbate by year of the conservative government force down real wage across the united kingdom leave work family still struggle to recover against that backdrop the most urgent task of this labour government be to raise living standard trade union be critical to that mission and the employment rights bill will help to deliver that the bill represent cornerstone of the government new deal for work people vote win manifesto pledge very much welcome evidence of the popularity of these policy in the platform of zohran mamdani new york newly elect democrat mayor among other thing he pledge protection for delivery worker include guarantee hour yet the amendment to this bill make in the other place would water down that commitment and deny work people the right they be promise therefore must speak in strong opposition to the lords amendment which take together would weaken the protection that this house have commit to deliver for work people across the united kingdom lord amendment and lords amendment to which concern day one right would remove the right not to be unfairly dismiss from the very start of employment instead they would impose six month qualifying period and empower minister to introduce further initial period in which only limited protection apply that be contrary to both the letter and the spirit of the government manifesto it would leave new employee vulnerable to arbitrary dismissal and recreate the very insecurity that the bill be design to end when the hon gentleman have speak to employer in his constituency about this specific provision be sure that he have what have they say the concept be pretty simple conservative members be conflate different issue around unfair dismissal and probationary contract they be scaremongere there be nothing in the bill that prevent the continuation of probation period the only thing we be say be that it would be unfair to dismiss somebody for an unlawful reason really wonder why it be so difficult to grasp that concept will the hon gentleman give way no because be conscious of time there be no impact on retain probationary period they remain intact have day one right against unfair dismissal do not prevent an employer vet and do recruitment properly and use probationary period legitimately turn to lords amendment the so call guarantee hour opt out this provision transform clear right into conditional option instead of guarantee contract that reflect the hour person actually work it allow employer to invite worker to opt out of that right altogether experience with the work time opt out show exactly where this lead it become standard clause routinely sign away that be not the end of exploitative zero hour contract it be their re badging finally lords amendment which reintroduce ballot threshold for industrial action seek to restore one of the most restrictive element of the trade union act this house have already agree that those provision be excessive and undemocratic no other organisation be bind by such turnout requirement before it may act reinstate they would frustrate meaningful negotiation and delay the resolution of dispute not promote it let we drop the threshold and quickly move to balloting as we promise for those reason urge hon member to resist the lords amendment and to insist on the bill as originally pass by this house it must be deliver in full for it represent the baseline of fair work settlement however while defend the bill we must also recognise that it be only starting point the consultation now under way must ensure that secondary legislation go far and fulfil the government wide promise to make work pay hope we see robust and enforceable right of access for trade union to workplace both physical and digital so that union can reach and represent worker effectively with penalty that deter obstruction hope we will create process to expand fair pay agreement beyond adult social care and school embed sectoral collective bargaining across the economy to raise pay and standard in every workplace we must also make progress towards single status of worker the employment rights bill be landmark measure but its promise will be realise only if this house defend it against dilution and strengthen it in implementation therefore call on all member to reject the lords amendment and to stand by our commitment to work people to deliver the new deal for work people in full and to build from it fair more secure world of work give that time be short madam deputy speaker will endeavour to keep my remark brief intend to speak to specific amendment today but feel compel to start with general comment in respect of financial interest throughout the stage of the bill and again today it have be suggest by the opposition that number of government members speak not from genuine and sincere belief but because of arrangement involve donation to their constituency labour party say to those on the opposition benches that that argument and line of thought betray laziness towards this issue that be reflect in their lack of effective scrutiny of the bill with the opposition resort instead to hackneyed and ancestral stereotype and lazy assumption that reflect nothing about the world of union and the world of work member of the public who be watch this debate will not necessarily have ready access to the record of the thousand of pound that have be take by each member refer simply to their financial interest in the interest of transparency will the hon gentleman therefore say how many thousand of pound he take from trade union if any to support this bill be grateful to the hon gentleman for prove my point exactly will happily tell he that since become member of this house have not receive penny in political donation from trade union my constituency labour party receive donation before the election but that be an entirely different matter have only one matter to draw attention to in my entry on the register of members financial interests which be my chairship of the gmb parliamentary group which be an unpaid role we be ask today to consider number of amendment that directly contradict our manifesto commitment lord amendment and on political fund be case in point in the other place the noble lord burns gently question whether this be manifesto issue but the make work pay document which our manifesto say would be implement in full clearly say that the trade union act would be repeal that must include this provision the amendment before we seek to preserve the punitive restriction that be originally impose as retribution in and repeal in after which we have year during which arrangement work effectively the actual impact of these amendment be they pass would be the same as any arrangement that move from opt out to opt in which be reduction in the ability of work people to speak with collective voice let we not forget that trade union political fund do not exclusively fund donation to party look at the campaign that have be run and the cross party support they have win such as gmb and unison protect the protectors and gmb campaign on domestic defence manufacturing two campaign that the conservatives come to support as well as usdaw freedom from fear and the gangmasters licensing act the result of unite campaign in the aftermath of the morecambe bay disaster in which so many cockle picker tragically and disgracefully lose their life even today in this place trade union funding help to address the abuse that have occur within the confine of the estate and which there be risk will continue in the future trade union be democratic body any member of trade union can demand to see the receipt of political expenditure and decision on party donation be take on collective basis when that provision be originally repeal the attlee government attorney general of the day say think this bear repeat today that the conservatives rely on the old delusion that the labour party be be build upon the hard earn penny of honest conservative who be too timid to declare their true political colour and be be bully by horrid nasty trade unionist into support the political fund of party to which they be so much opposed anyone who have work with trade union member will recognise that to be delusion indeed and we have hear much of that delusion from the opposition through the passage of the bill be go to make similar comment to those my hon friend the member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance who be both honourable and friend make in respect of lords amendment but she cover it expertly will finish by talk about lords amendment on the school support staff negotiate body which have not be discuss so far today recognise that this amendment be substantially different from other amendment that have be send to we on this matter but still believe that it be unnecessary first of all the overwhelming majority of academy employer do subscribe to the national joint council term and condition for school support staff term and condition which as have be widely recognise for more than year be out of date in respect of school support staff the effect of lords amendment would to be to create two tier arrangement between school support staff in local authority maintain school and academy it state that employer could introduce term and condition be concerned about the potential contradiction with the provision in the education schools act which that require such change to be make on collective and not unilateral basis furthermore it state that term and condition that could be change should be in aggregate an improvement that clearly leave room for employer to introduce weakening to some area to the detriment of the school support staff in my constituency be proud to have have an association with this bill and look forward to reject those specific amendment tonight proudly refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my involvement in the trade union movement throughout my professional career the employment rights bill be long overdue and although other continually seek to wreck it with worker unfriendly amendment we will not allow it we on the government benches know that this bill be about economic growth and security for all worker it be about ban unfair dismissal strengthen statutory sick pay outlaw fire and rehire and gain new maternity and paternity leave right and right to bereavement leave there be so many fantastic measure in this bill and as the minister note we be today again present with number of amendment that we do not support want to speak to just one lord amendment be about the employment rights bill most vital protection manifesto commitment on which proudly stand in my city to deliver the statutory entitlement to fix hour this be not an abstract legal reform it be common sense protection for people who be often invisible in our labour market and for whom insecurity be the norm not the exception my hon friend be make powerful point do she agree that exploitative zero hour contract be huge problem for worker and that ban they be big step so we should oppose any step to try to water down the legislation absolutely agree think the key word there be exploitative people in portsmouth north and across the country deserve fairness dignity and the ability to plan their daily life and future in sector such as retail hospitality construction social care and logistic many worker be on unpredictable variable hour with shift cancel at short notice or only minimal work week offer in order for employer to control their labour cost this make budgeting second job childcare healthcare planning and indeed everything in life almost impossible let give the house local example one of my constituent sara have work in portsmouth café on zero hour contract for four year she be tell at the beginning of each week what hour she might get one week she might have hour and the next week she might get eight and the next she might get nothing because she can not predict her hour she end up in debt skip medical visit and have to rely on emergency credit to pay her bill under the bill intend protection sara could request fix hour and have far great stability for herself and her family my hon friend be make an incredibly powerful point do she agree that for sara and for my constituent who be on short or zero hour contract the meat of the amendment which would introduce the bureaucratic farce of an offering of an offer instead of right would ruin the meaningful change in the bill and that the introduction of an ability for worker to opt out would open up loophole with detrimental effect in the real world where people could be reward with overtime if they agree to opt out absolutely it would leave worker unable to reject overtime even if they be knackere have already do or hour that week that bring to dave plasterer work on one of my local building site he be technically self employ but in reality he be also on rolling zero hour contract some week he earn enough to keep his mortgage and some week he earn enough to put aside little bit of money for christmas other week he earn nothing at all he be tell to stand down when winter hit and work slow with no pay no notice and no safety net that insecurity be corrosive and affect not just finance but family health and morale on job let we be clear the public be firmly with we accord to the tuc mega poll support for guarantee hour contract sit at over across the region and nation of the uk this be not about denigrate business and business owner many be fantastic and provide great opportunity but without the bill unscrupulous employer will continue to sidestep responsibility and run race to the bottom argument be make that these measure would impose burden on business discourage hiring and risk flooding employment tribunal those concern should not be pretext for hollow out protection and should instead ensure that worker know how much they will earn each month so that they can plan and live their life sara and dave who refer to early be just two name behind they be thousand of life blight by unfair employment practice sara and dave will not mind say that they be not young despite what the opposition want we to believe zero hour contract be not just exploitative for the young they be exploitative for many other people in our society people deserve the right to security urge colleague to reject these lords amendment which would weaken the bill because fix hour entitlement be not radical idea but basic standard of decency in the modern world of work if we really mean it when we say in this house that we respect work people we must deliver law that protect they refer hon member to my entry in the register of members financial interests as proud experienced hospitality worker of six year have proportionate respect for the work of the other place on the bill and be once again bemuse and frustrate on behalf of my constituent that this generational fundamental and basic common sense bit of legislation be once again before we along with the hill that many in other place seem to want to make stand on it be apparent that after year of stagnate living standard job no for the government be to make work pay again tip the scale in favour of work people and especially for the young generation who have be discuss today recapture work ethic and value of work that worry have be lose during the year of tory government why then do the other place insist on lords amendment and to which would remove the day one right on unfair dismissal that be once again tell young predominantly lower pay and insecure british worker in hospitality in factory and on work site across our constituency that their continue employment and income be precariously balanced on the benevolence of their employer not on the value of their labour that feeling be real every day that this measure be not on the statute book young man and woman be be bully prod and push out of their job by the small minority of bad employer that do exist across our constituency have have kid in their first job straight out of school further education or high education this be their first chance tell that they be sack in the week prior to two year of service look at lords amendment from my perspective see no reason why that same circumstance would not then occur few week before six month of service do my hon friend agree that good employer have nothing to fear from anything in the bill and that many good employer will embrace these measure as indeed many do when listen to business in my constituency find as be sure every member of this house do that they be worried across the piece for number of reason and have be for number of year yet many good employer do not rank this in their top five concern come forward and especially not the employer that work for in the hospitality and retail sector actually they see the benefit in keep worker for long and have more security in know who their workforce be that be major concern for the hospitality and retail sector that work in especially on come out of the pandemic and not be able to keep staff be also major cost on unfair dismissal if we accept the amendment we will leave people without legal right of action when they be unfairly dismiss we must reject it it be an unfair proposal move on to lords amendment why do the opposition insist on that it fundamentally mischaracterise the dynamic of the workplace for the majority of those who be on zero hour contract as be for six year in the relatively recent past rather than the employer proactively offer guarantee hour contract the amendment would put the obligation on the employee to access and accept in the lowest pay and most insecure industry this would be rife with potential for interference and bad incentive for employee to opt out to convenience the employer as have experience in hospitality and retail in reference to the work time directive this be rife throughout the sector especially when someone be finish shift late on and the employer need somebody in the next day can not see world in which this situation would not be subject to similar interference from the employer or bad with the reference period the employee will be give few hour especially if they have pre emptively insist to their employer that they would access that right on amendment be exasperate as have state several time that with the definition of seasonal work as capture include work in the creative industry retail hospitality and other sector there would be an attempt to carve out those sector from other right in the bill the tories lib dems reform and anybody else who support the amendment tonight will have to go back and explain to their constituent why they believe that those who serve they behind bar should access few right than those who work behind desk the industry target under the amendment be very specific be grateful to the hon member who like very much for give way on that point he be clearly massive fan of the employment rights bill the people of falkirk be watch he so would he like to commit to they that if have pass the employment rights bill unemployment go up and therefore we have few worker with few right he will resign from his seat make the commitment to the people of falkirk that the quality of their work especially for young people will go massively through the roof young people in my constituency who have be subject to insecure work low pay and zero hour contract have see the quality of their work diminish so my guarantee to the people of falkirk be that the quality of work will go up think other member refer to this but it be cheek for tory members to talk to post industrial community such as falkirk which be savage by the thatcherite government they will get absolutely no credence in my constituency say to those on the opposition benches that they have time to change their mind they can back the government today get the bill pass without it be water down and stop the attempt that be perceive at least in my constituency as an attempt to betray young british worker who be do the right thing go out and earn their way for too long under the tories those worker have lose the belief in the quality and opportunity that work provide they will see massive benefit from the bill make work pay and get this do for the final back bench contribution call anneliese midgley draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests regard my membership of and financial support from the trade union movement stand here as proud trade unionist with couple of decade of work behind stand up for the work class pay the truest of tribute to my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner and my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders my hon friend be absolutely right about some hon and right hon friend and the work that lot of people have do to bring this transformational bill to the commons we also need to mention my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald for his tremendous work at the very beginning of this process it be transformational and everybody deserve lot of credit success have many mother thank my hon friend for his intervention and absolutely agree with he about the work that my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east have do on this for over decade this bill bring change that tip the scale in favour of work people and take together with the rest of the new deal for work people it amount to the great uplift in worker right in our generation that be down to the friend that have just mention here today it be their legacy and it be one that will change the life of million of working class people for the well know that the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for halifax kate dearden will do great job of complete the process this be personal for because it be my dad secure well pay unionised job on the production line in ford halewood plant that give well life than my mum and dad have it lift we out of poverty and provide we with enough money and stability for decent home and enough to live life of dignity on everyone should have that and that be why will fight for work where people can flourish and thrive and for job to take pride in that can provide good life no way would be here in this place represent the place where be bear and raise if it be not for my dad job the tories back by the lib dems in the other place be try to water down the bill they be aid and abet by reform who be never in this place to debate this and have consistently vote against the bill some of the lords amendment would rip out the heart of the bill be go to speak briefly to amendment and to which would delay protection from unfair dismissal until worker have be in their job for six month this would mean that worker could be dismiss at whim for no reason how be this okay how be it defensible day one right not to be unfairly dismiss be good for worker and good for business my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery speak about the research from the ippr and the tuc which find that of employer support give employee protection from unfair dismissal from day one of employment the shadow minister the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith dismiss the tuc research from the dispatch box but it represent million worker and everyone else at work be they not stakeholder who should be listen to as well we know that good employer up and down the country already live up to the standard that we be set out in this bill today we need to stop these attempt to water down the employment rights bill deliver the protection from unfair dismissal that our constituent vote for and make sure we deliver the new deal for work people in full thank all member for their brilliant contribution today and for their engagement with the bill throughout the many month we have be debate it that be incredibly appreciated and value start by reiterate quote from professor simon deakin at the cambridge university centre for business strengthen employment law in this country in the last year have have pro employment effect the consensus on the economic impact of labour law be that far from be harmful to growth they contribute positively to productivity remind the shadow minister the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith who make number of contribution of my opening remark uk employment law be mostly product of the century they have not keep pace with how business employ people or with how people experience their work life today when how and where they work the world of work have fundamentally change in recent year it be regrettable that the hon gentleman party spend year impotently watch the rise of the gig economy and the many change in our employment landscape but now pretend that the status quo still work for everyone it simply do not that be why the bill be so important it raise those standard and level the play field for business so that they be not undercut by people who do not play by the rule which negatively impact their business and productivity the bill be important for work people so that they get that security and those right at work as well as for business include those good business that already go above and beyond and do brilliant work support our workforce and different economy across the country the shadow minister mention seasonal work the initial reference period will be set out in regulation as have already speak to reiterate that we believe that week be the right length balance the need for qualify worker to be offer those guarantee hour reasonably soon after they start role and the need for reference period long enough to establish the hour that they regularly work be surprised to hear the remark from the shadow minister on employment tribunal on their watch average wait time for an employment claimant increase by between and due to funding cut the previous government introduction of fee have disproportionate impact on woman and the low pay yet again we be fix mess that they leave behind the taskforce mention in my introductory speech for how we can fix our employment tribunal system and our work under the fair work agency which will be up and run next year be incredibly important as part of that wide package it be good to hear about the taskforce could the minister give we more information about what other thing it will look at and investigate that will support employee the taskforce will bring together different stakeholder so that we can assess the problem within the system and work out the good way to fix they because at the moment it be not work for employer or worker who want access to justice and want it quickly would the minister agree that the introduction of these right and protection be absolutely critical but equally important be the ability to enforce those right the fair work agency have the potential to bring that to fruition and ensure that when people be in those circumstance and be the beneficiary of an award they will ultimately receive it because far too many people take on these case and do not get any redress we meet matthew taylor the new chair of the fair work agency this week to discuss the agency progress to ensure that it be up and run at speed as my hon friend rightly point out enforcement be vital and it be crucial that worker be aware of their right that be why the agency be so transformational in our approach and important for our wide agenda to respond to the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for richmond park sarah olney urge she to support the government as we seek to update and upgrade our employment right to be fit for the century she mention lot around detail as mention early as be standard for lot of employment right legislation we want to consult extensively with business union and employer to ensure that we get this right and be sure that she agree with that approach the hon member mention turnout threshold as have mention we want to create an industrial relation framework fit for modern economy and workforce and that work for everybody we have be clear that we intend to ensure that trade union legislation be proportionate and effective and do not create unnecessary bureaucratic hurdle we remain committed to remove the turnout threshold for industrial action ballot through the repeal of the trade union act we support strong mandate for strike action but threshold set in legislation be not the good way to achieve that my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner talk about our proud labour legacy of the courage and conviction to change life and she be powerful and inspiring demonstration and testament to that that be why this legislation be so important reshape the world of work and deliver security and dignity that people can feel as she rightly mention we can not build strong economy through employment insecurity the legal loophole that exist have contribute to the erosion of living standard and allow race to the bottom be always grateful for her support and thank she for her offer of support as we proceed to royal assent and the implementation stag to ensure that everybody across the country can benefit worker and business alike and that be why the bill be pro worker pro business and pro growth my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders make powerful speech and respond eloquently to lot of point raise by opposition members and thank he for that reassure he that we remain committed to the repeal of the turnout threshold and we have be clear that it be our intention to align the removal of threshold with the establishment of balloting as an option for union the amendment do not change that commitment we be work at pace to permit electronic balloting by april he will be pleased to know that we will shortly launch consultation on an electronic and workplace ballot code of practice and encourage all stakeholder to respond to that consultation thank my hon friend the member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance for her excellent point on the importance and use of political fund reiterate my remark on the threshold and hope that she be reassure by they she will have hear the government commitment to deliver the bill in full from the prime minister and the secretary of state at labour conference hope to have reiterate that commitment at the dispatch box today thank my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald for all his work on this legislation it have be pleasure to work with he over number of year he mention fair pay agreement which we be introduce for social care as he rightly say we will learn from that process before consider their introduction in other sector but appreciate his passion for this area be sure that we will be in touch with he to speak about that progress on trade union access my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east may be aware that we launch consultation last week seek view on number of change to modernise and hardwire negotiation engagement and dispute resolution into industrial relation include the enforcement mechanism for the right of access thank he for raise that matter my hon friend the members for birmingham northfield laurence turner for falkirk euan stainbank for portsmouth north amanda martin and for knowsley anneliese midgley make brilliant point be forever grateful for their support they be strong advocate for work people across the country it have be wonderful to work with they over number of year and to be in this house today with lot of friend who have contribute to this agenda and this vital work hope that we have the chance to celebrate it at some point may invite the minister to respond to two thing first be ask early how many time the word maternity appear in the bill the word pregnancy appear time parental time and bereavement time but we can not restrict the debate to individual phrase secondly this be not some abacus exercise the real impact of the bill be the change and improvement it will make for million of work family thank to day one right thank my hon friend for that excellent and well make point be glad that he have manage to find the function with such speed always rely on he to provide such efficiency and clarity the bill will benefit more than million worker that be an incredibly powerful statistic to give at the dispatch box more than million people on zero hour contract could benefit as well as the many worker he mention who will benefit from further protection and right at work thank my good and hon friend for give way million of worker include those on zero hour contract stand to benefit from the measure in the bill do she agree that the amendment table by liberal democrat peer on the right to guarantee hour be an unworkable bureaucratic mess that open up scope for abusive practice in the workplace and remove the bill meaningful protection from far too many worker thank my good and hon

from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their wakeford question agree to public authorities fraud error and recovery bill consideration of lords amendment can inform the house that nothing in the lords amendment engage commons financial privilege clause interaction with other public authority etc beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lords amendment and government amendment and in lieu lord amendment and government amendment lord amendment and government motion to disagree and government amendment to in lieu lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment government motion to disagree and government amendment and in lieu lord amendment government motion to disagree and government amendment to in lieu lord amendment to to to to to and to the public authorities fraud error and recovery bill deliver on this government manifesto commitment to safeguard public money and ensure that every single pound be wisely spend fraud against the public sector be not victimless crime it take money away from vital public service erode trust and harm innocent people the bill introduce new power to enable the public sector fraud authority to investigate and deal with public sector fraud outside of the tax and social security system use its expertise to act on behalf of other part of government the bill also contain new power for the department for work and pensions to tackle fraud and error within the social security system provide much need modernisation for our defence at the same time it include significant safeguard include new independent oversight to ensure the proportionate and effective use of the power as we now reach the final stage of the bill be sure colleague across the house will agree that it need to receive royal assent as quickly as possible so that we can realise the delivery of the estimate billion of benefit by thank the minister for bring the bill forward and for all the hard work that the government have do in relation to this there be one thing that always concern in my office nearly every week have people come to who have inadvertently make mistake they perhaps do not understand how the online system work or how the paperwork have to be fill in and sometimes they have tick the wrong box and find themselves in difficult position this do not take away from those who deliberately defraud and try to get money that they should not be receive how can we be absolutely sure that those who make inadvertent mistake will not find themselves in difficult position alongside those who have do wrong how can we ensure that they get the sympathy they need know that the minister will be of the same opinion as that we must make sure this be do right the hon gentleman will be aware that it be enshrine elsewhere in legislation that claimant error be recoverable as part of universal credit can also assure he that as part of this bill the eligibility verification measure will enable we to identify error that be legitimate as well as illegitimate deliberate shall we say in order to minimise the level of debt for individual who have accept do this accidentally and ensure that they be catch early any overpayment will be small as direct consequence one advantage of the bill be that it can minimise suffer for people who have inadvertently make mistake before turn to the lords amendment thank my noble friends baroness anderson and baroness sherlock who expertly guide the bill through the other place share their appreciation for all the peer who contribute to its detailed scrutiny and their invaluable insight that have help the government to strengthen the bill the government make important change to the bill in the other place and now ask this house to endorse those government amendment they be make to ensure that the bill deliver its aim and to clarify the operation of the power as well as to ensure that the safeguard this government have introduce be strong and effective more procedural yet still important amendment have be make to part to reflect the scottish government position on how the power should be apply to devolve benefit across the bill we have make amendment that be more technical in nature include to reflect the recent datum use and access act and to ensure flexibility in the commencement of certain provision of the bill across the different nation of the united kingdom in the interest of time will focus my update to the house on the most substantial and pertinent area on which there have be extensive engagement with external stakeholder and point have be make by peer in the other place first the government table group of amendment to part to enable the public sector fraud authority to be merge with another statutory body rather than necessarily be set up as stand alone statutory body although the power to do so remain that build flexibility into the legislation enable the psfa to achieve the aim of separation between investigator and ministers in future while avoid the need to set up an entirely new statutory body if it be not consider proportionate to do so link to that would like to speak to minor and technical amendment that propose to make to lords amendment to schedule amendment simply ensure that authorise investigator be capture within the regulation make power set out in schedule if or when the power confer under part of the bill be transfer to another public authority or if the psfa be set up as its own statutory body it do not change the use of any power lay out in the bill the government also amend part and to ensure that the government must disclose relevant information to the psfa independent reviewer and the eligibility verification notice independent reviewer effective oversight be critical aspect of this government approach these amendment do not represent change in that approach indeed they far strengthen the commitment this government have make to support open and transparent use of the power will return to the point about oversight later in relation to lords amendment the government make several amendment to the debt provision across part and those be consequence of the extensive engagement by the psfa and the department for work and pensions with the financial sector and they clarify important aspect of the operation of the power include in situation where liable person might have legal deputy manage their affair they also strengthen the right of debtor by ensure that deduction order can not be in suspension indefinitely and that after two year period in suspension it will not be resurrect the government have also respond to the continue confusion that seem to have arise on the dwp debt recovery provision in part and who those power apply to the government have make amendment explicitly state that direct deduction order as outline in schedule and disqualification from drive order as outline in schedule can not be make where the person be entitle to and in receipt of benefit from the dwp that clarify the exist intent that these power be only for use with those who be not on benefit where the money can not be recover from payslip and where the person can afford to pay and be refuse to do so remind the house that this power address an important point of fairness it can not be right that those who can pay money back can avoid do so and the amendment underline that point the government also act to strengthen the legislative safeguard around the use of the eligibility verification measure remind the house that that measure simply enable the dwp to ask financial institution for limited datum that will help the department to identify incorrect payment and verify eligibility for specific benefit the amendment make by the government in the other place will introduce an explicit necessary and proportionate test before an eligibility notice can be issue and clarify the purpose for which an eligibility notice can be issue to only assist in identify incorrect payment that put the exist policy intent in the bill again will return to the eligibility verification measure when address lords amendment turn to the other amendment make in the other place we welcome the challenge and scrutiny provide by peer contribution but we can not accept change that risk undermine the power the government position will continue to reflect that include in our amendment in lieu first lords amendment would give the minister for the cabinet office the power to initiate an investigation when they consider it necessary in the public interest interruption just so that he be sure of that power the parliamentary secretary cabinet office my hon friend the member for makerfield josh simons have join on the front bench we be propose technical change to lords amendment through amendment and in lieu those change will give the minister for the cabinet office the power to initiate an investigation when they consider it necessary in the public interest the other place ask we to go far than the original drafting of the bill allow and our amendment show that we have listen the government believe that it will almost never be necessary for the minister to exercise that new power because of the collaborative approach in the normal working of government but it will be available if there be genuine need our amendment in lieu also make consequential change to clause to preserve the intention that the psfa should not take on matter assign to the secretary of state with responsibility for social security or his majesty revenue and customs the reason for that be that the dwp and hmrc already have well establish function and framework to tackle social security and tax fraud of course it go without say that both departments may still collaborate with the psfa if fraud cross many departmental boundary turn now to lords amendment and the government wholeheartedly agree that the measure in part of the bill be powerful and must be use with care we agree that staff must be appropriately train before they be able to use these power and that robust oversight both internal and external be essential our amendment and in lieu mandate statutory guidance and new reporting requirement and set internal record requirement the amendment in lieu ensure strong ministerial and parliamentary oversight of the power as be call for by the other house without involve ministers unnecessarily in operational decision the statutory guidance will detail how the minister will exercise the function of investigate suspect fraud against public authority it will outline structure of internal oversight the delegation of power standard for the training and appointment of all authorise officer and investigator and the psfa collaboration with an independent reviewer new report will be prepare follow the end of each financial year and lay in parliament by the minister state how many time the investigation and enforcement power in part have be use there be now requirement in the bill for the psfa to keep internal record of the use of those power available for scrutiny by an independent reviewer together those measure ensure that minister be accountable for the use of the power and show how they be delegate in place they build on process that would already have be in place but we have put they in the bill let move on to part of the bill focus first on lords amendment on the treatment of information obtain under an eligibility verification notice although understand the intent of the other place can not accept the amendment as draft and urge member instead to back government amendment and in lieu lord amendment risk compromise the weight that the dwp may be able to attribute to information obtain through an eligibility verification notice the government have be clear that evm information on its own have no tag of suspicion attach and that the dwp must look within its own system first and check for any inconsistency before take further action however depend on the information hold evm information may form an important part of any further action we must not compromise that the amendment also risk legislate for person state of mind in this case that of dwp authorise officer that be something that we should avoid where we can it be far well to focus legislation on the action that must or must not take place follow receipt of evm information the second part of the amendment relate to the seniority of staff who must review evm information risk undermine the exist public law principle that staff at dwp take decision on the secretary of state behalf there be also uncertainty about what would constitute suitably senior person in any case the secretary of state must be satisfied that official be suitably train and experience to take decision on their behalf government amendment and in lieu of lords amendment seek to address those risk and build on the amendment that the government table on report in the lords they more accurately reflect the policy intent and focus on the action that dwp staff must take follow receipt of evm information the amendment in lieu clarify that where the dwp have receive evm information it must also have regard to all other relevant information that it hold before take further action first the amendment in lieu require an authorised officer to consider all information hold that be relevant to the question of whether to issue an information notice as well as the relevant evm information before issue the notice under the department investigatory power secondly they require dwp agent to consider all information hold that be relevant to the question of whether to suspend payment as well as the relevant evm information before suspend that payment finally they require dwp agent to consider all information hold that be relevant to the question of whether to change an early benefit decision as well as the relevant evm information before make that change believe that our amendment succeed in offer the necessary reassurance about the way individual within the dwp will take decision once evm information be receive by the dwp namely that no decision will be make use evm information in isolation and therefore urge hon member to back they be still not exactly clear why the minister disagree with lords amendment understand that he be say that dwp agent will look at evm information and everything else but what happen in circumstance when they have only evm and not much else by way of information be he unable to agree with lords amendment because if the dwp have only evm information he want decision to be take base only on that and not on anything else there be couple of issue with lords amendment as draft it could minimise clear evidence from an evn that have be return the point about what information dwp agent would have to consider be pertinent because it may answer question about why for example someone have more than in bank account it be about consider all information not about have no further information on which to act be probably not explain that tremendously well but be effectively say that an evn could provide information that be sufficient for we to launch fraud investigation but we would want to consider all relevant information include that evn to see whether that information be valid or should be discount for any reason of which we be aware can not accept lords amendment which would add three additional requirement to the role that the evn independent reviewer would be require to undertake on propose new paragraph in lords amendment regard cost incur by business the government be commit to keep cost associate with the measure proportionate and to minimum official have discuss this part of the amendment with the finance industry which acknowledge that it may place significant burden on financial institution if they be ask to report on cost every year that be something we clearly would want to avoid as for propose new paragraph of the amendment let be clear that there be no reason for individual to lose access to banking service solely because of information share under the eligibility verification measure we have be clear that this information do not imply any wrongdoing and the measure simply provide source of datum which feed into long stand process in dwp and the department already have layer of support and specialist staff to support those who be vulnerable or have complex need government amendment and in lieu of lords amendment which have speak to reaffirm this furthermore the measure will help our customer it will help we spot error in claim soon and take step to correct they and help prevent large overpayment and debt from build up as say in response to the intervention from the hon member for strangford jim shannon as for propose new paragraph in lords amendment have already outline that the government amendment make in the other place require the secretary of state to provide the independent evm reviewer with all reasonably require material so there be no need for the reviewer to write statement to that effect in every report but if they feel the need to there be nothing to stop they do so finally lords amendment concern the dwp authorise investigator use of reasonable force begin by remind the house that the power of search and seizure be intend to be use by expert dwp staff train to industry standard to tackle only serious and organised crime against the dwp while understand the intent of the other place again can not accept the amendment the use of reasonable force be set out in the police and criminal evidence act that govern all body exercise that power to ensure single consistent framework it do not distinguish between use of force against item and use of force against person we can not break down section of pace and there be no precedent in pace for specify where or on what reasonable force may be apply however have be clear from the outset that the dwp policy position be never that dwp authorised investigator should be able to use reasonable force against person instead the aim be to allow they to gain access to property such as locked filing cabinet or cupboard when on premise to search for and seize critical evidence where force against person might be need the intention have always be to rely on the like of the police stand by the position that the good way to provide for the dwp to have power of reasonable force be to remain within the umbrella of pace to safeguard consistency there be clear precedent for that other government departments draw on the same power of reasonable force however have hear the concern raise about this measure in the other place so be introduce government amendment to in lieu of lords amendment to clause and schedule to draw distinction between the power of reasonable force exercisable by dwp authorise investigator and that exercisable by police officer these amendment remove the power of reasonable force derive from section of pace and instead create stand alone provision on reasonable force in this bill they restrict dwp authorise investigator access to reasonable force so that it be force against property only while retain the police power to use reasonable force where necessary against people and property this deliver the policy intent but bring the dwp power of reasonable force outside of pace to ensure the stand alone power of reasonable force benefit from the safeguard provide by alignment with pace dwp authorise investigator will still operate in compliance with pace code in their exercise of search and seizure power my department be work closely with the home office on this official in the home office have confirm that secondary legislation will be lay before parliament to insert the relevant clause of this bill on reasonable force into pace code when parliamentary time allow have repeatedly assure the house that the dwp policy position be that dwp authorise investigator will not use reasonable force against people and believe that the amendment put that beyond doubt the government be grateful for the scrutiny of this bill improvement have be make as result however we can not accept amendment that undermine how the power will operate so urge the house to support the government alternative proposal call the shadow minister begin by echo the thank express to member in all part of the house and in the other place who have contribute to the bill in particular pay tribute to the excellent work of baroness finn viscount younger and lord vaux whose detailed and constructive engagement make the bill strong more balanced and more effective this bill be about protect taxpayer money ensure fairness for those who play by the rule and give our public body the power that they need to tackle fraud and error wherever they occur every pound lose to fraud be pound take from taxpayer public service and the people who rely on they tackle fraud and error and send clear message to fraudster that they will not succeed be vital and this bill take an important step towards do that but there be more to be do and our colleague in the other place have do brilliant job of scrutinise the legislation acknowledge that the government have be incredibly constructive in their approach thank to the determination of conservative and cross bench peer number of important concession have be make improve the bill will touch on several of the lords amendment lord amendment concern the power of the public sector fraud authority to conduct proactive investigation when the bill be introduce the psfa could act only when invite in by another authority that risk prevent it from act even when there be credible intelligence that fraud be take place our conservative colleague in the lords rightly identify that gap and bring forward an amendment that would empower the psfa to act proactively where there be reasonable ground to suspect fraud without wait for formal request that ability to act swiftly and decisively be essential if we be to stop fraud before more money be lose the government amendment in lieu reflect the principle in lords amendment ensure that the psfa new power operate in clear and accountable framework this be an important issue so we welcome that concession which strengthen the psfa ability to intervene early and protect taxpayer money lord amendment and relate to oversight and accountability and would ensure that with new power come clear line of ministerial responsibility conservative peer raise legitimate question about how serious investigative power in the bill would be authorise particularly those base on the police and criminal evidence act the principle be simple when government official be to exercise significant power ministers must remain accountable to parliament for how those power be use follow discussion the government have table amendment in lieu of lords amendment and which we have accept as compromise on the basis that the initial guidance be subject to take note debate in grand committee that would allow parliament to consider and scrutinise the guidance in full would be grateful if the minister could in his closing remark confirm that this remain the government position apologise if he say so already and do not quite catch it let turn to lords amendment modern fraud prevention increasingly rely on technology include artificial intelligence and data drive eligibility check use well those tool can help to identify pattern and protect public fund but they must be use responsibly and transparently lord vaux viscount younger and baroness finn raise fair concern they say that the use of ai or automated eligibility indicator should never amount to reasonable ground for suspicion on their own technology might inform decision but it must not replace human judgment so it be welcome that the government have listen their amendment in lieu make it explicit that before any intrusive action be take such as amend benefit or launch an investigation the information must be review by suitably qualified human officer we believe that ensure that we get the good of both world we harness innovation to protect the taxpayer while retain human judgment to safeguard individual lord amendment concern the eligibility verification mechanism and its impact on vulnerable people and financial institution the amendment would task the independent reviewer of the mechanism with assess how the system take into account the additional need of vulnerable people whether it risk benefit claimant be prematurely de banked and the cost to bank and financial institution of comply throughout the passage of this bill member include conservative members have emphasise the need to protect those who may be more vulnerable include people face financial hardship and those with disability we be disappointed that the government be not back lords amendment but it be reassure that they have commit to ensure that all the point make in both houses be feed directly into the work of the independent reviewer we understand that meeting will be set up between member and the independent reviewer after royal assent so that these issue can be explore in detail we will continue to push to ensure that ministers deliver on those promise but we hope that this engagement will ensure that the review proceed with full understanding of parliament concern about proportionality cost and fairness as the minister rightly say government amendment to lords amendment be essentially technical correction we have no issue with it because it tidy up the text but do not alter the substance of the bill finally turn to lords amendment which concern the issue of reasonable force by department for work and pensions investigator we do not believe that it be the government intention that dwp investigator should use force against individual that power rightly rest with the police who be train in its use and accountable for it however that be not clear in the legislation as originally draft the explanatory note state that this power will be limit to use reasonable force against thing not people but that be not specify in the bill after we raise this issue in committee in the commons lords amendment seek to clarify that dwp officer may use reasonable force only against property not against people the government amendment in lieu be compromise but the bill do now distinguish between the use of force against people and the use of force against property for investigator who be not constable which be the clarification we be look for in summary thank to the thorough work of colleague in both houses the bill today be well than when it be first introduce it give the public sector fraud authority the power to act proactively embed ministerial accountability ensure the responsible use of technology protect vulnerable people and provide clarity on how enforcement power may be use there remain area in which we think the bill could be far strengthen there be still nothing in it to tackle sickfluencer nor be amendment require the government to review the whistleblowing procedure in the civil service accept it be regrettable that the minister miss those opportunity but it be welcome that the government be at least willing to listen in other area and we have some very good debate on the bit that the government have not accept although we will not oppose the amendment that the government have table in response to the lords amendment this bill must not be the limit of their ambition it be the late step in crack down on fraud and error but we need to see continued effort action and enforcement from this government because the message must be clear that fraudster must not and will not succeed every pound steal through fraud be pound lose to the taxpayer our public service and those who do the right thing that be why we will keep press for vigilance transparency and fairness as this bill become law the minister may remember that on report table number of amendment in the hope of safeguard the public from see their bank become an arm of the state today will speak about lords amendment which deal with the scope of the eligibility verification measure the evm would give the dwp power to give certain financial organisation an eligibility verification notice that notice would require the receiver to identify relevant account that specify benefit be pay into assess those account against eligibility indicator and where there be indication that incorrect payment have be or may be make share specify detail of those account with the department the bill include provision for an independent reviewer to conduct an annual review of the secretary of state power under the evm lord amendment seek to expand the scope of that review to ensure that the cost to bank be proportionate and that any unintended adverse consequence to benefit recipient be identify at the moment the independent review of the evm need only consider the extent to which the secretary of state and the financial institution in receipt of notice have comply with the requirement when exercise the measure and whether the evm have be effective in assist in identify incorrect benefit payment it do not require the independent reviewer to also consider whether the evm be be use proportionately which be the key to lords amendment it be essential that any consideration of the proportionality of the evm take into account the potential harm to individual in committee several witness warn that the evm could result in serious harm to benefit recipient for example there be the possibility of an algorithmic error when automated system be use on population wide scale if the algorithm be scan the bank account of million people an error rate of just will result in case where innocent people be wrongly investigate as mention on report be concerned about what this bill say about our welfare state it be in danger of create second class citizenship where welfare recipient have few civil liberty than the rest of we it turn bank into an arm of the state empower to trawl through personal datum even when there be no suspicion of wrongdoing it strip away fundamental principle of british justice the presumption of innocence that be why we need to ensure that in the annual review of the power the independent reviewer consider the harm to individual so that we can understand whether the power be exercise be proportionate therefore urge the minister to address these concern while there be still time and accept lords amendment as basic safeguard to ensure that those who be most likely to be impact by these power be take into account when we scrutinise how they have be exercise call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the government for the step take to improve the bill since it be debate in committee we as liberal democrats still have grave concern about element of the bill but it be in much well place and thank all colleague for work together collaboratively to drive for improvement clearly fraud be wrong some people believe that fraud against large organisation such as supermarket and the government be victimless crime but if we do not have that money because it have be fraudulently claim we have to apply large taxis or choose not to spend money on thing such as tackle climate change it be therefore important that it be tackle but we need to ensure that we have two word guide we proportionality and fairness we as liberal democrats still have grave concern that element of the bill be not as proportionate as one would wish will focus my remark on lords amendment we liberal democrats feel that more responsibility should be give to the independent reviewer in relation to proportionality and fairness we still have concern about the blanket approach where mass fishing will effectively occur with the proposal before we one do not have to look that far back in recent it history to see where thing have go wrong believe it be only last week that child benefit be freeze for household across the united kingdom because those family leave the country and be not account for when they return that error be make on computer system and that affect just small proportion of those to whom this bill be set to be apply the reasonableness of ministers be debate repeatedly in committee be not question the reasonableness of the current minister or multiple ministers who precede he but question what we be see on the other side of the atlantic and the person who have the lever of power in the oval office what may be see as reasonable in politic in the united kingdom be sadly distant memory in the united states of america we must ensure that we guard against that future in the legislation we be put forward now on the use of force the liberal democrats be pleased that the government have take step in the right direction in their amendment although we feel that it could be strong we would encourage colleague to vote against the government proposal because we strongly support lords amendment must say that do get bit edgy when front bencher agree so much in respect of lords amendment want to be absolutely clear about what the minister have say as far as be aware it will now be human being make the decision an authorise officer the authorise officer will be able to draw upon all other information that be what the minister say but it be still not clear to whether decision can be make simply on the basis of the evm information it would therefore be useful if the government intention be read into the record more clearly as for lords amendment want to follow up on what be say by my hon friend the member for poole neil duncan jordan we have receive representation with regard to in particular people suffer from mental health issue some of whom would be lead chaotic life the minister be right to say that it be not for minister to engage in the process of make individual decision because that be for the authorise officer to do but the one occasion on which the minister can be hold to account be when the annual independent review take place accord to my understanding the minister say that the reviewer would not be prevent from explore the issue of the exercise of power and the impact on vulnerable people may suggest that that could be strengthen perhaps he will tell we when he respond to the debate it be not just about prevention it be appropriate for the independent review to consider that issue largely because of the representation that we have receive consistently throughout our debate on the bill and from wide range of organisation that represent people with disability and in particular mental health challenge statement to that effect would be more reassuring than the word that we have hear so far do not really understand why the government would resist this because it be just basic element of accountability in an area that as my hon friend the member for poole have say could affect so many people and could have such significant adverse effect do not want to exaggerate but be in the house throughout our discussion of the introduction of the work capability assessment and although the last government refuse to accept it we now know that it result in large number of suicide in this instance would not want we to enter into reform of the process specify in the bill without regular review of the harm that could be cause which would enable we subsequently to adjust the legislation if necessary would welcome clarification from the minister or perhaps strengthening of the word that he have use so far everyone accept that we need to keep handle on fraud but the power be take in the bill include dwp access to people private bank account go much far than anything we have see in the past can we trust the dwp to exercise these sweeping new power in fair and responsible way unfortunately past dwp error have have the most tragic consequence philippa day be year old when she die she be find unconscious next to letter from the dwp refuse her request for an at home assessment philippa have agoraphobia and anxiety make it impossible for she to attend personal independence payment assessment in person those at the dwp know that they be tell by her sister and they would have be tell by her mental health team if they have bother to speak to they but they do not the letter by her side be the last of long back and forth exchange with the dwp during their final conversation about the dwp philippa say to her sister do try to fight they but why be she have to fight they in the first place surely this be system that be design to help the coroner report identify separate failing by the dwp and its private assessor capita error be make from the very outset her pip claim form be lose her mental health need be not log and no attempt be make to communicate with her mental health team or her gp to ensure that the very system design to help she would do just that it be easy to see with system riddle with error and seemingly devoid of compassion how someone could be drive to just give up the fight philippa write not die because suicidal ve be so trap for so long and then come along the government people who have assume be there to help since january the my benefit have be severely cut also want to share with the house what happen to kristie hunt kristie be train to become nurse she be she have be on pip and employment and support allowance until she rejoin the workforce after year admirable consider her struggle with mental health she like philippa be basically strong person kristie inform the dwp about her return to employment but staff forget to log her call so kristie be hound by call and letter from the counter fraud team the dwp even send incorrect information to her local council result in further letter and threat of lose her home for month kristie be subject to erroneous accusation of fraud and threat of lose her flat and the life she have fight so hard to build back on her final call with the dwp she be note as be confused and tearful yet no one even ask whether she be okay no one flag concern for her welfare all they want be the money kristie be an example of person use the system that be design to support she back into work but be instead the victim of mistake after mistake there be many other could describe karen mcbride stephen carré david holmes david clapson errol graham kevin gale jodey whiting roy curtis and james oliver all of they be wrongly hound by the dwp which at least contribute to their death it do not reassure that part of the name of this bill start with fraud when the big cause of overpayment be departmental error the dwp have long track record of badly handle mistake that be cultural failing and it be wildly optimistic to assume that everything be suddenly go to be fine go forward do the government really believe that this bill have enough check and balance to protect vulnerable claimant one thing be for sure there will be more dwp mistake go forward would ask that the government commit to make coroner report automatically available to the public in every case where there be link to the dwp action it be not easy to follow that excellent speech really appreciate the hon member for horsham john milne read out the name of people who have be fail by the system that be mean to support they and we should remember that the system be what fail they as he say in number of case they be incredibly strong people who have fight through adversity but be then fail by the system significant number of disabled people have have to fight for so much of what they have they have have to fight every day just to manage to get to work or get to the shop they have have to fight for so much and the system that be mean to support they should not then be another battleground want to talk about number of different thing in the bill but will start with the fact that this be not happy bill and the snp do not support it we be unhappy with significant proportion of the bill direction of travel such as on the eligibility verification not least because of the potential future risk say to the conservatives when they be in government and will say again now that the labour party be in government that you will not be in government for ever at some point somebody else will be in government and if it be somebody who share the authoritarian idea of some potential future leader be not sure that want they to have access to everybody bank account we need to look at the proportionality of access universal credit claimant bank account to see if they be commit fraud wonder what proportion of universal credit claimant defraud the system compare with the proportion of billionaire who defraud his majesty revenue and customs and do not pay the level of tax that they should be pay do not think it be proportionate for we to say that universal credit claimant need to have their bank account look at because they be likely to commit fraud whereas people who earn million and million of pound and store it in offshore trust do not have exactly the same constraint put on all the many bank account that they may have it be disproportionate for we to assume that social security claimant be more likely to defraud the system than anyone else especially give that we have significant level of proof that other people do defraud the system and that significant number of the error make through overpayment for example be make by dwp itself rather than by the claimant the hon member for poole neil duncan jordan talk about element of lords amendment and vulnerable individual who may be disadvantage if we could trust that dwp never or very rarely make mistake could understand the government put forward this bill from the write down fact in coroner report and from all our constituency casework we know that dwp make mistake be not blame individual at dwp for make those mistake there be sometimes systemic failure and sometimes individual failure mistake be make at dwp and add both another layer of place where it can make mistake and further ability to sanction people for example by take their car away or look at their bank account will not be proportionate until dwp be much less likely to make mistake and to greatly overpay carer for example and then attempt to claw back the money the government need to get the department in order before take action against individual understand that there be people who defraud the system be not doubt for second that that be the case but as the hon member for horsham say put the word error first might have be helpful give that significant proportion of the money that be overpay be due to error turn to the cost and saving mention in lords amendment on how much it cost to recoup money and to undertake an investigation in order to see whether somebody be defraud the system we know that school meal debt system be set up and we have have bailiff at people door look for under of school meal debt send bailiff to somebody door for under involve disproportionate cost and hope that everybody in this room think that we should not be spend so much money and upset somebody life that much for the sake of if person can not afford to pay of school meal debt they have pretty significant problem and send bailiff to their door be not go to help we only know about some of these bailiff situation because they have be bring to mps or because they have be report by various organisation aberlour children charity have do huge amount of amazing work on public sector debt and some of the method that be use to recoup that money the government should have to report whether it cost disproportionate amount for we to ensure that we be not pay out very small amount think it be completely reasonable for that question to be ask think it be completely reasonable as well the hon member for poole talk about this to think about vulnerable group and whether they be overly disadvantaged by the system be put in place will people with learn difficulty specific mental condition and physical disability and those from certain minority community that be already marginalise for example gypsy travellers be specifically disadvantage by the change all lords amendment ask be for report to ensure that those vulnerability if there be an entrenchment of inequality and an increase in the disadvantage face by people be report on so we aware of it and there be transparency and so we can see that it be create significant additional disadvantage on an already vulnerable and marginalised community would therefore really appreciate it if the government agree rather than disagree with lords amendment finally on lords amendment the amount of money propose to be save by the bill in its entirety the total amount of saving be understand billion government of all colour be monumentally bad at report back on how much saving have be achieve by any of the measure they put in place on just about anything unless tax be hypothecate for example we do not see exactly how much money be save or exactly how much money be spend and whether it deliver what be promise by the government again it be government of all colour who do not do post implementation review in the right amount of time and when there be change of government they sometimes just forget that post implementation review exist we will not know with any level of accuracy unless we get proper report on cost and saving exactly how much money be save and whether the government have meet their target or expect amount of billion so have significant concern appreciate the minister answer to on lords amendment have not understand what he have say originally on his position on lords amendment and the answer he give in response do clarify his position do not agree with his position but now understand why the government hold that position still think it would be important to ensure there be thing in place other than the evm understand the government want little bit more flexibility and that they be say they have to look at all the other information they hold it be possible that the dwp may not hold any more information or may hold very little more information therefore the decision to initiate fraud investigation could be take almost entirely if not completely entirely on the evm that be why still disagree with the minister position would like requirement for the dwp to have more than just that one piece of information my understanding be that that be what lords amendment intend to do in the first place but appreciate that other amendment in lieu have be table by the government to provide little more clarity on what be expect would expect they to look at all the information provide as the minister say be just concerned that they may not hold lot of information and requirement to look at all the information they hold when they only hold one piece of information get we back to the situation we be in at the beginning where it could hinge on one thing rather than look at wide suite of thing generally speak madam deputy speaker will sit down in just moment the snp be not in favour of the bill we have significant concern if the minister when he respond confirm that the government will do as much as they can on transparency and that they will report back on the level of cost and saving that be create by the bill that would give measure of comfort still will not support the bill and might still vote against some of the amendment table today but think it would make member from across the house bit more comfortable to have well understanding of what be happen and whether the bill be work as the government intend with the leave of the house call the minister begin by thank the member who have contribute for what be thoughtful contribution even where we fundamentally disagree on aspect of the bill have already outline the benefit of the government propose approach but will respond briefly to some of the specific point make in the debate first thank the opposition spokesperson the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith for the constructive way that she and colleague in both houses have engage on the bill she be correct that we have end up in well place and thank she and all member who feed into that process that be the point of it be pleased with where we have end up the hon lady ask two specific question can confirm that there will be take note debate at grand committee as she reference at the point when statutory guidance be lay before parliament can also confirm that member will be able to meet with the psfa independent reviewer will briefly touch on some of the point surround lords amendment which have take up the majority of the debate be grateful for the comment make by my hon friend the member for poole neil duncan jordan and my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell as well as the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman and for horsham john milne and the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for torbay steve darling first think we need to be clear about where we have already act in other part of the bill or in amendment that have come forward today on the question of cost for instance the independent reviewer already have to look at effectiveness and have already commit to update the impact assessment within month of the power come into force will turn to the question of vulnerable people which the hon member for horsham in particular illustrate very eloquently indeed with move example want to say something specifically on debanking which be concern that have be raise multiple time throughout the stage of the bill we be very clear that nobody vulnerable or otherwise should be debanke as result of the bill as be make clear in the code of practice and in amendment we be consider today there be many exist layer of protection in our exist process on vulnerable people lords amendment clarifie that the use of the power must be necessary and proportionate which believe would cover this my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington make specific point on whether evm information alone be enough we be bake in human decision maker at all point throughout the process we can not take decision base on evm information in isolation we must consider all other relevant information practically that mean that we must look at benefit claim and check for disregard or for any other reason that someone may have capital in excess of the limit before take any action however as say early do think that this bill be much improve from where we start just want to clarify one point for the life of can not understand why the government be resist have contain within the annual review the question of whether harm be be do because that is to be fair the only way we will learn whether the legislation be operate in the way the government wish it to and then whether any change in the system be need when we have the work capability assessment it take we year and more than thousand suicide before people accept that there be problem because there be no review mechanism publicly available that be all this amendment be ask for all be ask for today be for the minister to put on the record very clearly that it be perfectly appropriate for the independent reviewer to look at the harm that could have be create by this legislation appreciate the point my right hon friend be make as have just say the question of whether action take as part of the eligibility verification measure be necessary and proportionate be bake into the bill and believe that would cover the point he be make strongly encourage my right hon friend to attend the meeting with the independent reviewer that refer to early to stress that point will certainly go along and will undertake to press on that too understand where we be on lords amendment but with the additional safeguard that will be bake in through the amendment in lieu believe we have reach point where the bill will achieve what it need to while be fair and protect vulnerable people urge all colleague to support the government proposal today lord amendment disagree to government amendment and make in lieu of lords amendment government amendment make to lords amendment lord amendment as amend agree to lord amendment and disagree to government amendment to make in lieu of lords amendment and clause eligibility verification independent review motion make and question put that this house disagree with

with strong maritime heritage and large population of child young people and old resident currently have no public swimming pool far declare that access to swimming facility be essential for water safety education physical and mental health rehabilitation and community cohesion and note that the lack of such infrastructure disproportionately affect those without the mean to travel to facility elsewhere the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to support the campaign to build swimming pool in falmouth recognise the health and social benefit to the community particularly as facility for child grow up in coastal area learn to swim safely and the petitioner remain etc drug relate deaths motion make and question propose that this house do now costigan extend my thank to mr speaker for provide the opportunity to discuss the crucial matter of drug relate death declare an interest as the unremunerated chair of the centre for evidence base drug policy think tank in this policy space the office for national statistics report last month that death relate to drug poisoning have increase for the consecutive year and have consequently reach an all time high once again the ons report that in there be death relate to drug poisoning in england and wales with just under half of those confirm to involve an opiate continuity be therefore not strategy it be guarantee of further avoidable loss every single one of those life matter and every single one of those death be preventable eight month ago similar debate be hold in westminster hall on the topic of prevent drug relate death to which the minister respond though it be well attend debate during which member from across the house call for the expansion of harm reduction and evidence base measure be afraid to say that since then limited progress have be make in advance drug policy to limit the unspeakable further loss of life in our constituency stoke on trent have the high number of drug relate death in north staffordshire synthetic cathinone colloquially know as monkey dust be use in stoke on trent to an extent not see elsewhere in the country do my hon friend agree that more need to be do to battle the scourge of monkey dust in stoke on trent absolutely agree there be huge regional disparity in drug death across the country and regional approach need to be take to tackle they while appreciate that drug policy and legislation do not fall under the minister departmental remit be happy to see she here as the drug relate death crisis be primarily public health issue and must be treat as such if we be to avoid repeat the same mistake of the last year be proud to be patron of burton addiction centre residential rehab centre in my constituency it be call for target across the nation do my hon friend agree with that target for residential rehab perhaps the minister would like to visit some time when she be able to completely agree about the role that rehab facility can play in support people into recovery and about the need for proper consistent funding from the government commend the hon lady for bring forward the debate congratulate she on the campaign and on her word to the house on the issue we all greatly admire what she do and thank she for it in northern ireland there be drug relate death in that be an increase of on the decade before and it prove her point that the issue be not specific to her constituency unfortunately this happen everywhere do she agree that the tactic we have in place be not address the grow prevalence of drug abuse and that not only this government but the devolve government must work to save the precious soul who be pass away thank the hon gentleman for his intervention without it it would not be an adjournment debate completely agree the death that be talk about today be drug poisoning in england and wales only but if we look at drug death in scotland and northern ireland and at death relate to alcohol and despair we see that drug poisoning in england and wales be very small part of huge issue in every part of our united kingdom thank my hon friend for secure this important debate scotland have have the high number of drug death in europe for seven year in row there be in do she agree that cut to funding for rehabilitation facility and drug and alcohol support service undermine the holistic comprehensive approach need if we be to bring down the number of drug death and to give hope to those live with addiction and to their family the number of drug death in scotland be stark and it underline the fact that the issue affect every part of the uk we know what we need to do to start address it welcome the recent scottish affairs committee report which will mention later have say before that put drug within the home office ministerial purview be put the issue in the wrong place so be very happy that health minister be here to respond the current approach be root in the belief that we can simply arrest and imprison our way out of this despite the death toll rise every year in the six year that have be do this job the home office seem to show not just lack of curiosity but hostility towards harm reduction measure my overarching question today be will the government finally take an evidence base stance on drug policy to reduce the immense harm that the status quo cause in our constituency will the minister work across government to bring forward necessary change to the misuse of drugs act and deliver fit for purpose public health lead approach to drug across the uk save thousand of life thank my hon friend for secure the debate in the bradford district there be drug relate death in agree with she that we need to take different approach to tackle the problem and it must be public health approach the uk could learn much from country like portugal which have go long way towards adopt such an approach to drug and drug relate death absolutely agree later will try to develop my argument for that kind of approach which we could take here but do not as parliament and as society we may have inadvertently come to accept the yearly statistic and have perhaps not give they the necessary thought but stress that there be cost effective solution that could save the taxpayer money and save the life of our constituent while take money out of the pocket of exploitative organise criminal gang be afraid to say that the problem may be far bad than be recognise recent report by king college london indicate that there have be severe under reporting of drug relate death over the past year the researcher find that drug relate death have be under report by and opioid relate death between and be find to be high than record put the estimate number of opioid relate death in that period north of be grateful to my hon friend for secure this debate she will be aware that many of those who have die from complication and overdose relate to opioid die on their own that reflect the social isolation that so many experience when they become addicted to drug do she agree that it be incredibly important that the social isolation of those seek to move beyond addiction be break through and will she join in thank organisation like jungle in my constituency which seek to provide companionship and support for those who be try to move beyond addiction my right hon friend be exactly right the clear way to recovery be with companionship and support there be no path to recovery without that and of course give credit to the organisation she mention that be do such fantastic work in this space as we be discuss early today the implication of the under reporting of drug relate death be that the problem be far bad than previously think and the decision to cut funding to service under the previous government be base on flawed figure the national audit office report that between and there be reduction in real term spend on adult drug and alcohol service so do not think it be coincidence that the office for national statistics have report near doubling in drug relate death since and that the number of death only rise every year it be clear that the problem have be make substantively bad by under investment by the previous government we can all acknowledge that but acknowledgment without reform be meaningless persist with failed punitive policy will only deepen crisis that already rank among europe bad now be the time to show the difference labour government can make by put in place harm reduction policy that will start to undo this extensive damage as mention previously and will repeat again because it be important near half of all drug relate death register in be confirm to involve an opioid in addition this year ons report find that the number of death involve nitazene group of highly potent synthetic opioid almost quadruple from the year before this mark the beginning of new stage in the drug relate death crisis as we have see across the atlantic once those synthetic opioid take hold it become all the more difficult to limit their devastation welcome this government change to the human medicine regulation that far expand access to naloxone the lifesaving opioid antidote administer in the event of an overdose indeed naloxone play vital role in the fight against drug relate death however further change be necessary and naloxone should be available rapidly and reliably in every community pharmacy in the uk so that it can be quickly access in the event of an overdose it be important to note that naloxone can not be administer by the person overdose and must instead be administer by someone else that necessitate further education on the existence of naloxone and how and when to use it with people who may come into contact with people who use opioid include frontline service worker such as police officer and transport worker and the love one of those struggle with addiction the period immediately after release from prison or discharge from hospital be when risk peak opt out pathway for naloxone distribution should be the norm take home naloxone on release or discharge same day linkage to community treatment and clear pathway for handover care be essential for people struggle with substance use disorder as of december the government estimate the annual cost of illegal drug use in england to be billion around of that be attribute to drug relate crime while harm link to drug relate death and homicide account for further notably the majority of those cost be associate with the estimate people who use opiate and crack cocaine in england dame carol black landmark review of uk drug policy find that for every for every spend on treatment be save through reduce demand on the health and justice system in the face of rise fatality and cost of live crisis fail to scale treatment and harm reduction measure be both morally indefensible and financially illiterate if we want to realise that four to one return we must provide long term funding for organisation deliver service drug treatment service can only deliver if they be able to retain staff train consistently and scale accord to demand commend my hon friend for bring this important debate to the house do she agree that organisation such as change grow live which have visit in rugby be do superb work with people as they recover after the problem that they have be face and that it be incumbent upon all of we to do everything we can to encourage the government to ensure that those organisation get the funding and support they need to do that important work my hon friend be exactly right change grow live be fantastic organisation multi year funding scheme with clear outcome metric such as fast time for treatment improve retention and improve naloxone coverage will make difference in bring down the figure have talk about that be the path out of this crisis recently receive letter from my hon friend the minister for policing and crime state she could not support overdose prevention centre because of concern about organise crime supply the drug there overdose prevention centre be frontline evidence base intervention that save life and public money reduce ambulance call out and attendance cut public injecting and needlestick injury and create bridge into treatment recognise and share the minister concern about supply but with or without such centre people will use the same drug either in alleyways and stairwell or in safe hygienic setting where sharp be dispose of and where staff can intervene and build relationship that can be the foundation for recovery from addiction the scottish affairs committee recently publish report into problem drug use in scotland and glasgow safe drug consumption facility and it be interesting to note the call for legislative action from the uk government and parliament and the fact that they seem to share my frustration with the home office ideological rather than evidence base approach on safe drug consumption facility in write correspondence to my hon friend the minister for policing and crime also maintain that supply essential safe inhalation equipment would contravene current legislation and that the government be unable to support such provision or to provide legal pathway to address this encourage drug user to change their method of consume drug from inject to inhaling can be an important harm reduction step yet while supply clean hypodermic needle be exempt under section of the misuse of drugs act the government continue to support policy of criminalisation of potential provider and user of safe inhalation equipment be grateful to my hon friend for take an intervention and indeed for bring forward this debate as she have reference the scottish affairs committee have do some work on this issue and have visit the safe drug consumption room in glasgow but it have also look at facility in norway and lisbon the disappointment we have be that at the moment the thistle operate under the prosecutorial discretion of the lord advocate in scotland and that could continue indefinitely she have make that clear as could her permission for other centre to open we need change in the legislation that would allow such centre to be set up across the country if necessary there be go to be three year assessment of the thistle and if that assessment come up with the result that we think it might then surely that evidence should be use to inform government policy our particular disappointment be that the government seem not to think that be relevant absolutely agree and take note from that report however it be clear from the minister evidence that the home office will not make legislative change even if the evaluation find that the facility have be effective in meet its aim that be ideological not evidence base which be why believe the home office be fundamentally incapable of deal with drug death and drug harm in our community commend my hon friend for secure this really important debate do she agree that even if the home office do not agree with change legislation more could be do within exist legislation for example with drug checking facility of which very small number be already license by the home office that would allow those consume drug to have clarity about what they be consume but it would also provide important intelligence to the authority about the drug that be in circulation to inform the response of health and other authority absolutely agree that more can be do without the need for change in legislation but it be concern that the home office do not look at legislation despite everything that be say in the home affairs committee inquiry on drug in the last parliament for example which make very clear how outdated our current legislative framework be there do not seem to be curiosity about fix this completely agree with what my hon friend say about treatment and testing particularly at large scale event and festival because that can be lifesave intervention it be both bizarre and frustrating that the home office actively choose not to take some of the measure it could take on safe drug consumption facility and safe inhalation equipment that be something that be very much within its gift we can not continue to hide behind statue periodically tighten but rarely review that have too often exacerbate harm if the house wish to take money out of criminal market ask the minister to work across department to expand diamorphine assist treatment which be prove to be effective and cost save both here and abroad to provide dignified supervise care for those with the most entrenched opioid dependence after all it be in this country that that type of world class treatment originate with the publication of the rolleston report in have focus much of my remark on opioid but in the short time remain will touch on some other substance the first substance be cocaine with death involve cocaine register in which be high than in the previous year and time high than in that be perhaps not surprising give that the uk be the large consumer of cocaine per capita in europe and the second large consumer of it in the world accord to the oecd the national crime agency estimate that in england scotland and wales consume tonne of the drug it be worth mention that around of homicide be drug relate and there be evidence that cocaine use be fuel domestic violence in pilot scheme find that of domestic abuse offender arrest in seven police force area test positive for cocaine opiate the status quo be not work the second substance be ketamine while ketamine death be relatively low with death the stat be again trend the wrong way as be the prevalence of the drug in our community refer member to the rate of past year ketamine use among to year old which have double since the drug be reclassify from class to class in we need fit for
