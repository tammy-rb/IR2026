shortbread which be bake in my constituency and the scottish salmon industry have warmly welcome the deal for scotland why do the minister think that the snp the tories and reform have set their face against it my hon friend speak very powerfully for his local business and be delighted that great produce such as paterson shortbread lorne sausage and scottish seed potato will benefit from easy and cheap trade with the eu via the sps agreement any party that want to reverse that will have to explain why it want to take billion worth of benefit year by away from our economy do the minister agree

last nine year have teach we nothing else they have surely teach we that it be much easy to agree about the need for an agreement than it be to reach an agreement the sps agreement will be critical

the process of agree the legal text on the sps agreement while we await the detail of the sps deal northern ireland be still see new and additional bureaucracy to implement the windsor framework do the minister agree that it would make more sense to extend the grace period and put freeze on that bureaucracy rather than introduce more as indicate in the report by the federation of small businesses in northern ireland on our ability to negotiate generally it be hugely important that we show good faith in implement the agreement that the country previously agree however say to the hon gentleman that always show pragmatism on implement the windsor framework if we take parcel for example when go to belfast last summer be tell that there be no readiness for business there but apply for and secure six month delay and then implement that part of the agreement so he can be assure that take pragmatic approach plan for change what recent progress he have make on implement the plan

infected blood compensation authority to consider remain concerned that sir brian langstaff have never ask as the minister who be responsible for the design of the scheme to account for the process that adopt under the advice of the civil servant that my successor the minister share be concern now that there will be continue lack of clarity and certainty for those who have be wait for too long we appoint an expert group on the good advice of the civil servant we ensure that there would be engagement with representative from the group and meet they over meeting in day prior to legislation come to this house be gravely concerned that continue uncertainty through more report writing will not serve the good interest of this community do the minister agree and what step will he take to resolve these matter once and for all pay tribute to the work of my predecessor as paymaster general in this area know the practical experience with which the right hon gentleman speak when give evidence to the inquiry back in may say that be not bring counsel of perfection and that would listen to suggestion which would judge on the basis of not cause further undue delay to victim who have already wait for too long that be the approach will take as urgently look at the recommendation with your permission mr speaker will hopefully update the house on that before the summer recess sir brian langstaff be particularly critical of the engagement with the infected and affected community since the publication of his final report in may last year in particular he be critical of the way the expert group be set up with the explicit instruction not to engage with the community do my right hon friend accept that lot of damage have be do since the publication of that final report as be expose in the report that sir brian langstaff publish yesterday will he say what he intend to do to improve relationship with the infected and the affected be deeply sympathetic to the inquiry word on the involvement of the infected blood community the government be commit to provide fair compensation to victim of this scandal the inquiry recognise this and say there can be no doubt that the government have do right in way which powerfully signal its intent however also recognise what sir brian say when he state that there be still more to be do to ensure that the detail and operation of the scheme match up to its intent will now urgently look at those recommendation with view to action my constituent graham be victim of the infected blood scandal his experience and the length of time that he have have to wait for compensation have strong parallel with another constituent of mine steve who be the last raf officer to go to prison for be gay both constituent have suffer decade of trauma as result what parallel can the minister draw when learn about those two compensation scheme and how will we ensure that in future the administration of such scheme be smoother swifter and well experience for those who be impact the hon lady speak very movingly about her constituent graham and steve who have clearly have to wait decade far too long for justice she raise fair point about learn from compensation scheme this be historical for instance we have the windrush compensation scheme that begin under the previous government we have horizon ongoing and infect blood where the inquiry have just produce an additional report but the compensation scheme be ongoing on infected blood ibca have use test and learn approach which think be important in allow we to move into phase in which we can speed up payment to the hon lady central point it be vital and be conscious of this that we look at what have work well in previous compensation scheme and at what have work less well and

national defence and it be take extremely seriously the national cyber security centre work with victim of these attack and give advice in peacetime as it be as to how business can well defend themselves against these rogue operator who try to extort they be recently make aware by ge vernova that its uk base low cost bid for the eastern green link be pass over in favour of high cost overseas supplier would the minister meet and ge vernova to discuss current procurement policy and whether it do enough to support uk manufacturing and to ensure our energy security and net zero commitment while can not comment on the individual procurement can say that we be change procurement rule to strengthen the focus on british job and skill and to support british industry critical to our national security like energy we be consult on this at the moment and would be more than happy to meet my hon friend and the company to discuss this far it be constant complaint from my business in harrow that if they be not on the government approve list they almost can not get government contract what action will the minister take to ensure that new firm include new small and medium sized enterprise can actually get contract and keep job in the uk absolutely agree that we need to support sme which be why we set target for all departments on sme and voluntary community and social enterprise spend it be why we be review the rule to make it easy for sme to get on to government contract and why we be consult on new plan to set target for the entire public sector on sme spend early this year the government publish their national procurement policy statement give that economic growth be this government no mission will the minister update the house on how the new approach to procurement will ensure we deliver economic growth in every corner of this country especially in the central belt forth valley and falkirk really welcome the house continue enthusiasm and support for procurement we have listen to that and be take it seriously which be why we set out as say couple of week ago further change to procurement rule to respond to all those point about support sme support british job and support british skill can the minister confirm the amount of money that have be save as result of the change bring in to the equality diversity and inclusion guidance in the civil service will he also say if he will be maintain those change or do he seek to overturn that policy be not seek to overturn that but we want to have system where we uphold the equality law that apply to the civil service just as it apply throughout the public sector far to the answer give by the paymaster general regard the contaminated blood inquiry welcome that he will update the house when he have have an opportunity to digest yesterday report but can have an assurance from he that it will not be on the last sitting day before recess may be in the hand of mr speaker so will certainly not tread on to which day will be permit to do so but definitely before the summer recess mr speaker as you be well aware bridlington be the lobster capital of europe so there be understandable outrage at the recent government decision to sell out the uk fishing industry for the next year in return for sanitary and phytosanitary deal that be yet to be negotiate be that just another example of the shambolic way this government do business no absolutely not what we have first of all be multi year deal with stability which will give the opportunity for investment the government will then invest million in coastal community and update the fleet if the hon gentleman be oppose to that he should say so surely he be not and the sps agreement will allow our catch to be sell far more easily to the eu by the way of our catch currently go to the eu he should be welcome that welcome the uk eu reset which will help to bring down energy bill and grocery bill also welcome the government new procurement plan bournemouth east have fantastic talent particularly among our young population will the minister outline how the new procurement plan will both help to give those young people opportunity and secure clean power in the south west we have set out plan to strengthen and streamline social value so that we be absolutely clear about the expectation on business to support job skill and opportunity namely opportunity for our young people to get into good quality work in community like my hon friend think the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and be politically completely at one because if it be down the two of we we would relocate all civil servant to wolverhampton and staffordshire what be also incredibly important be minister be in those office will he commit to publish the detail of ministerial attendance in office outside london include how long they stay in those office be not sure will while ministers should attend on occasion minister have to be in certain place just to keep up with publish record be not the good use of their time very much welcome civil servant work in wolverhampton the cabinet office have fantastic building in glasgow which have enjoy visit and work in on several occasion be disappoint that the uk government do not go ahead with proposal for glasgow campus for uk government office one reason behind that proposal be upgrade the facility available to foreign commonwealth and development office staff who be locate at abercrombie house in east kilbride which have be assess as lack the facility require to be second fcdo headquarters will the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster work with the fcdo to ensure that that investment go into abercrombie house so that it can be second headquarters if the right hon gentleman ambition be to move the staff out of east kilbride he should perhaps have word with my hon friend the member for east kilbride and strathaven joani reid we have good location in both glasgow and east kilbride and we welcome they both to refer to the previous question recently spend time work in the east kilbride office hope that it be good home for civil servant for some time to come uk france nuclear partnership urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make statement on the uk france nuclear partnership the uk and france have proud history of co operation on defence nuclear matter alongside our conventional warfighting capability the independent strategic nuclear force of the uk and france contribute significantly to the overall security of the nato alliance and the euro atlantic since we have state that we do not see situation arise in which the vital interest of one could be threaten without the vital interest of the other also be threaten in both nation agree to share research facility and co operate on nuclear technology under the lancaster house treaty in at chatham house the defence secretary set out the importance of reboot lancaster house and our defence relationship with france that be reaffirm in our manifesto today the prime minister and president emmanuel macron will agree to deepen their nuclear co operation and work more closely than ever before on nuclear deterrence that be an important step forward for the uk france nuclear partnership and reflect the significant improvement in the relationship between our two country that this government have drive soon to be sign declaration will state for the first time that the respective deterrent of both country be independent but can be co ordinated the declaration will also affirm that there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt response by both nation as such any adversary threaten the vital interest of britain or france could be confront by the strength of the nuclear force of both nation co operation between our country on nuclear research will also deepen while we work together to uphold the international non proliferation architecture further detail will follow today agreement in an increasingly volatile and complex global security environment exemplify by russia war of aggression in ukraine war on the european continent the uk and france as europe two nuclear power be unite in our determination to work close than ever before on nuclear deterrence that be manifesto commitment promise make and promise keep and yet another example of how the government be deliver for defence thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker do think it be incredible that we have have to find out about such substantive matter overnight from the press and without statement from the government we conservative back our nuclear deterrent and have never waver on that we support step that boost the resilience of our nuclear enterprise diversify delivery and above all help our core continuous at sea deterrence to remain the cornerstone of our homeland defence against the most extreme threat we also welcome step to genuinely strengthen uk french co operation on defence build on lancaster house in particular have be the government who first authorise provision of long range storm shadow missile to ukraine we recognise the urgent need to replenish our own storm shadow stock which be in the press release can the minister confirm whether we be place order for new storm shadow missile from mbda or simply recondition exist stock the nuclear aspect of this be by far the most significant can the minister confirm where this will leave the operationally independent and sovereign nature of our exist trident nuclear deterrent the telegraph quote the declaration which of course we have not see as say that both nuclear arsenal remain independent but can be co ordinated and that there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt response by both nation do this mean that our respective national deterrence will now be jointly operationally deliver and how will that co ordination take place in practice crucially how do this new nuclear doctrine affect nato and our very close co operation on nuclear deterrence with the united states will france now be offer its nuclear deterrent to nato as we do perhaps most importantly will france be join the nato nuclear planning group on the matter of tactical nuclear weapon have previously ask about option other than us control gravity bomb with no reply give the announcement on storm shadow and mbda will the uk and france now be look at co operation on tactical nuclear delivery option via our share complex weapon industrial base particular concern of the opposition be that there appear to be deep paradox at play here talk of close co operation with france but in the background the government still get nowhere on access to hard cash from the european rearmament fund despite have give up our sovereign fishing ground to conclude it be truly extraordinary that such significant defence development do not warrant government statement so the minister must now be as transparent as possible in answer our question not least after week dominate by smoke and mirror on defence spending and chaotic turn on welfare that raise the most profound question of all where be the money go to come from there have not be statement yet because the agreement have not be sign yet in fact you brief it to the press if the right hon gentleman would like to listen to the reply the agreement have not be sign yet be sure that as soon as it be sign but it have be brief to the press be sure that as soon as it be the shadow minister have ask his question would like to try to answer they without he heckle too much although it be up to he how he behave no it will be up to indeed the shadow minister ask whether the idea that we should work more closely with france have any implication for the independence of trident and he refer to the phrase independent but can be co ordinated the answer be no our casd operation be entirely unaffected this be not new nuclear doctrine on behalf of the uk our nuclear doctrine be the same as it ever have be the use of our nuclear deterrent in any circumstance can only be authorise by the prime minister and that remain the case the french have their own arrangement for how they authorise theirs it be matter for they this agreement imply no co ordination in that respect the agreement say that there be an opportunity when vital interest be affect for co ordination between both nation in the way in which they respond that just strengthen the power of the deterrent across europe when two nation that be nuclear power can co ordinate their response it strengthen the deterrent against our potential enemy by make it clear that the two nation will act in co ordination rather than entirely separately the shadow minister ask whether the agreement have any implication for our deterrent still be dedicate to nato it do not our deterrent be of course still dedicate to the defence of nato he refer again to tactical nuclear delivery option do not know whether he mean tactical nuclear weapon development this government do not see any use of any kind of nuclear weapon as tactical and we be not propose in this agreement to develop any new kind of nuclear weapon it be about co ordinate the option that we have together to make europe and the north atlantic stronger welcome today agreement that be in train as powerful signal that britain be once again step up to be reliable european ally with deep uk france co ordination on nuclear deterrence mark step change in how we engage with our close partner this be not just diplomatic milestone it have real potential to reset relation strengthen european security and drive long term investment into our industrial base as the keen champion of our sovereign capability and resilient supply chain particularly in my constituency may ask the minister how this partnership will be use to maximise opportunity for uk industry ensure that we can build the skill infrastructure and capacity that be need to keep our deterrent credible for decade to come the effort on co ordinate our nuclear deterrence between the uk and france be in the context of refresh of the lancaster house treaty which also include provision about co ordinate our conventional force and co ordinating effort through our industry to ensure that we can manufacture new and future proof complex weapon that will assist in deter potential adversary who would threaten europe this be in the context of an entire refresh agreement that should strengthen our conventional force as well as our capacity for co ordination between our military and of our nuclear deterrence call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats have consistently say that the uk security depend on deep defence co operation with our european ally so we welcome progress but urge the government to go far nuclear co ordination between the uk and france can help to deter putin and support europe collective security that be particularly critical as donald trump have show that our security be no long his concern france cherish the independence of its nuclear system as the minister confirm so will she provide further detail on exactly how the new system of co ordinating nuclear deterrence will work the government must now go far so will the minister update the house on whether the government have secure full access for uk defence firm to the eu security action for europe fund as putin escalate his attack against civilian target in kyiv and other city we must work with our ally to support ukraine will the government use today coalition of the willing talk to agree on how the uk and france can seize russia frozen asset that be hold in our two country thank the hon gentleman for his support for deep defence co operation on the co ordination of our nuclear deterrence there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt response by our two nation but france and the uk remain two sovereign nuclear weapon state and their respective nuclear force and decision make process be independent there will be increase co ordination of research and development and of the co operation that we have be engage in since the chequers announcement of that will be deepen and co ordinating committee between the élysée and the cabinet office will be the joint arrangement for decide precisely how and what extra research or training we might do there will be increase co ordination of that effort but stress that our decision make arrangement remain completely independent both nation recognise that there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt response by our two nation our vital interest be the same in that respect on security action for europe and access to eu fund negotiation be ongoing but not complete one would hope that progress can be make can not recall the hon gentleman third point the coalition of the willing have nothing furth to say on that today as the hon gentleman would probably expect in response to an urgent question on nuclear co ordination be the minister as surprised as be to find that the shadow secretary of state only half quote that sentence from the report in navy lookout about make it clear that no extreme threat to european security would go unanswered by both country but fail to look at the real purpose here that it signal strengthen deterrence posture as russia have repeat its threat to use nuclear weapon do my hon friend agree that this show that the relationship which be damage by brexit be now be recreate by this government the aukus pact and defence co operation be now clear priority for this government with the european union and that be embody in this new relationship with france suppose should say that be surprised that the shadow secretary of state for defence only quote half the sentence if indeed that be the case but he be probably not the first opposition spokesperson to do that in the history of oppositions in this house agree with my hon friend that what we have here be strengthening of the deterrent across europe which will help to deter potential adversary from conduct themselves in way that might threaten the future of our nation welcome the announcement of strengthen collaboration with france although read between the line it sound like co ordination be actually submarine patrol deconfliction our aerial participation in the nato nuclear mission be still decade away with the completion of delivery not schedule until accord to the government but both the french air force and marine nationale be arm with the air sol moyenne portée amélioré asmpa medium range supersonic nuclear tip missile as part of their force de dissuasion be that nuclear strike capability within the scope of this agreement if so how will it be incorporate into our own nuclear doctrine will it be an escalation step prior to the use of trident do this form an interim solution while we await the capability to fully participate in the nato nuclear mission how will command of it work the hon gentleman complain about the amount of time it have take this government to do thing in respect of defence but we have to pick up the mess that be leave by his government who be in office for year it be bit of cheek for he to complain about delay when the reality be that his own government do nothing for year have make it quite clear that our defence nuclear posture be not change and that we be not seek to acquire new and different nuclear weapon but if the vital interest of the uk and france be engage and threaten we will co ordinate our nuclear response as result of this agreement and that provide great deterrent much strong relationship between the uk and france in this area will require deepening of our commercial collaboration in our respective industrial basis particularly in the supply chain will the minister comment on how the government own procurement policy will help to support this collaboration particularly as it might benefit company in the teesside defence and innovation cluster my hon friend be correct the refresh of the lancaster house treaty be about not just nuclear co operation but co operation between our conventional force and great co operation and effort between our industry bilaterally to provide we with thing like complex weapon in way that will deter and enable we to defend ourselves at threshold well below any nuclear threshold any increase in defence spending as we be see do give more opportunity for our own industry whether those company be offer novel or dual use technology or be our traditional big prime any increase offer more opportunity for all of they to help we in our rearmament understand that the ink may not yet be dry on this agreement so clearly the minister can answer only on what she be aware of at the moment however she mention the use of committee to make decision who will chair that committee what will its membership be how will decision be make if there be disagreement between our ally in france and ourselves our respective national authority will remain responsible for plan and conduct operation uk france nuclear steering group will be establish to provide political direction for increased co ordination across nuclear policy capability and operation that will be joint between the élysée which have authority over nuclear matter in france and the cabinet office which will co ordinate with it obviously with input from the ministry of defence welcome my right hon friend response and great collaboration between the uk and france with this nuclear partnership it not only enhance our nation security but have the potential to deliver highly skilled and highly pay job to every nation and region across our country will she say little more about how those benefit will be realise in scotland my hon friend be correct the strategic defence review and our ongoing commitment to increase defence spending in this country give opportunity for our industry to benefit obtain contract and assist we in ensure that we can defend our nation and nato more fully and in well way go forward there will be job skilled opportunity and growth in all part of the nation and region of the uk the threat and nuclear sabre rattle that we have hear from president putin since russia full scale invasion of ukraine be utterly unacceptable and the response from the british and french government have be robust for defence co operation between the uk and france be always welcome will our government also seek to get reaffirmation from other country include russia of the reagan gorbachev formula that nuclear war can not be win and must never be fight thank the hon gentleman for his support for this extra co ordination the aim of all this be to make sure that nato and europe be safe from the threat that may come from putin and his nuclear sabre rattle as the hon gentleman refer to we believe that deter those threat be the good way to ensure that we do not end up have to fight war that would be catastrophic that be where we be at present be not sure that president putin be in the mood to agree that nuclear war can not be win because he do issue nuclear threat every now and then we need to ensure that he be deter in his approach the two bedrock of our national defence be our own sovereign capability and our membership of nato the united kingdom and france be both member of nato but as the shadow secretary of state point out the paradox be that we and every other nato member bar one be member of the nato nuclear planning group of course that bar one be france as part of these discussion be france go to join the nato nuclear planning group if not how on earth will this co ordination work within that partnership be not here to speak for the french government as far as be concern our nuclear posture have not change their nuclear posture be matter for they what this agreement say be that there be no extreme threat to europe that would not prompt response by our two nation and although we both independently look after and be responsible for our deterrence we believe that co ordinating potential response in this way provide great deterrent for europe and nato that be the basis of this agreement clearly our deep and close relationship on nuclear deterrence be with the united states of america can the minister confirm how this agreement will affect that relationship which be crucial for our security the agreement do not change our very close relationship with the americans in line with the nato strategic concept the strategic force of the us the uk and france all contribute significantly to the overall security of the alliance there be no reason why that should not continue to be the case rise rise call jim shannon thank you very much mr speaker always expect to be call last but have just jump in ahead of my colleague and friend the hon member for south antrim robin swann thank the minister for her answer today we very much welcome the news that we be to enhance our nuclear programme that security can only be good for our whole nation however the estimate have read still put our nuclear capability well below the threat pose by russia so how can we continue to build our nuclear capability and how can northern ireland play part in that work the minister be always committed to help northern ireland so be very keen to hear how that will work the hon gentleman be usually last but never least and he be not even last on this occasion agree that it be important that we strengthen the credibility of our deterrence which be why we be commit to build the four replacement boat that will carry our continuous at sea deterrent and up to ssn through ssn aukus we be double the drumbeat of our construction of submarine over time which think send pretty powerful signal to potential adversary that our casd and our capacity to defend and to use it be go to be significantly strengthen over the come period be glad to say that have find general support for that in this house which welcome the minister reference the political steering group that will be set up between the two nation be there any concern either within government or within the ministry of defence about share intelligence with separate political steering group that will sit outside of or adjacent to nato the steering group be about political policymaking rather than intelligence be sure that appropriate arrangement will be establish if there be any such issue but do not anticipate that there will be problem on point of order mr speaker point of order relevant to this debate indeed may seek your guidance on how to set the record straight follow the question from the hon member for brent west barry gardiner the minister criticise the fact that only partially refer to quote from the declaration text to be clear have not see the declaration it be leak to the medium overnight that be all could read from and be none the wiser from the answer we have just have order please we can not keep the debate go you have make the point and it be on the record let we move on business of the house will the leader of the house give the house the forthcoming business the business for the week commence july include monday july committee of the whole house and remain stage of

subject for this debate be determine by the backbench business committee the house will rise for the summer recess at the conclusion of business on tuesday july and return on monday september call the shadow leader of the house be not go to let this moment pass be sure no colleague would wish to without again remind everyone present that this week mark the anniversary of the bombing on july people be kill in four separate attack and more be injure many of they grievously know that the whole house will want to join in mourn the victim of these dreadful crime and in send all our good wish to their family and love one while we be on the subject of anniversary the house will need no reminding that be year since simon de montfort convene the first representative parliament perhaps even more significantly this year mark year since the year when the charter we now know as magna carta be agree as statute and indeed become the first of all our statute to that extent it be and not that should be recognise as the birth date of magna carta interruption be pleased to hear that wide array of support from the house thank you think it be an important point to put on the record for the government of course the past week mark an anniversary of somewhat less glorious and happy kind their first full year in office as house it fall to we to ask how the government have do it would be right to focus in the first place on their shockingly negligent and abusive treatment of our northern ireland veteran but that be the topic of westminster hall debate next monday so let we focus on wide issue labour pledge to deliver the high economic growth in the in reality uk growth have fail even to beat the average labour promise to meet nhs waiting list target for of patient but the current figure stand at one percentage point well than year ago labour vow to smash the boat and the boat gang yet small boat migrant number be up by almost compare with this time last year perhaps we can forget the pledge how then be the uk economy actually do well we know that the office for budget responsibility have cut its growth forecast to just inflation be high than year ago and unemployment stand at its high for four year so diminish be the government stand in international market that the institute for fiscal studies recently point out that the uk now face high borrowing cost than almost all comparable country it be two full percentage point high than germany and high even than greece and italy be afraid to say that the government have store up more pain to come the junior doctor have now vote in favour of further strike through the autumn and into the new year they have increase last year the house will recall and they be now look to their labour brother and sister for scarcely believable furth that be before we include their pension the secretary of state for health and social care have as the wildly overrated aneurin bevan say in stuff their mouth with gold and they be already come back for more what have the medium reaction be to all this internationally the economist describe the prime minister first year as waste time call it catalogue of error the normally sympathetic new york times comment that britain prime minister be fade away before our eye even supportive british newspaper have not be able to disguise their dismay the financial times have bewail labour drift and the guardian its lack of my word but those of some of the most respected newspaper in the world finally what do the poor suffer public make of all this we know what laser focus those in downing street keep on the poll and it will not have escape their notice that the prime minister approval rating be now at no government in recent time have ever lose public support after an election fast than this one how mortify the prime minister must be to be wrench back almost weekly from the perfumed chancery of europe to the grimmer reality of domestic politic we need not dwell on the piety and pomposity of labour pronouncement about stability and trust before the july election these be the fact they speak for themselves and they say only this must do well lot well may join the shadow leader of the house in mark the anniversary of the bombing we all remember that day well and be sure that the whole house will want to remember all those who die and those who be affect by it may also take this opportunity to welcome the newly announce new director of the independent complaints and grievance scheme the highly qualified miriam minty who will be start in september as the shadow leader of the house say this week we welcome the french president to the uk for state visit think his address to both houses on tuesday be excellent and historic and thank you mr speaker your team and all those involve in organise it think that it underline the deep and endure relationship between our two great country the visit conclude today with summit and will ensure that the house be update at the early opportunity on any agreement that we come to as part of that have to say it be bit gall that week in week out the right hon gentleman raise the propose strike action by junior doctor which be extremely disappointing we do not think strike action be necessary give that the nhs be finally move in the right direction strike would put that recovery at risk affect patient and let down our collective obligation to those we be here to serve we have deliver very generous pay settlement but we be keen to work constructively the health secretary door remain open he will be in the house shortly our approach be very different from that which the conservatives leave we they leave the nhs on its knee with waiting list at record high and with over half million appointment and operation cancel due to strike action in just one year and it be not just the doctor the rail strike cost the economy over billion the teacher strike lose teaching day in one year and the conservatives go to war with public sector worker week in week out do notice though that the leader of the opposition be today give speech in which she will talk about the tick time bomb that have be leave too right there be tick time bomb it be the conservatives tick time bomb we all know that they leave mine all over the place and we be have to sweep they out the right hon gentleman want to know how our first year in office be go and be happy to tell he we promise million extra nhs appointment and we have deliver million more than that we say that we would get waiting list down and they be come down month on month interest rate be come down net migration be come down from record high under the conservatives we have secure three trade deal trade deal that they once hail but never deliver and we have get they go we have create nearly new job since the election we have recruit an extra new police officer we have build nearly new home establish great british energy extend the warm home discount to million more household expand free school meal for half million more child and open free breakfast club we have ban bonus for water boss who have be pollute our river and wage grow more in our first month in office than they do in the conservatives last year in office be happy to debate he any time on our record and thank he for the opportunity to do so today do feel slightly sorry for the shadow leader of the house when come here week in and week out it be just go from bad to bad for the conservative party be it not perhaps that be why he go so deep into history in his question because he do not want to talk about recent history he be one of the first up this morning after let we be honest big defection overnight the late in long line of those flee the sink ship personally would not put have put jake berry good friend of boris johnson and former chair of the conservative party down as likely defector it really be that bad for the conservatives however could not have put it well myself when jake say we ve get conservative party that do seem to know what it stand for any more the conservatives have lose their way they ve abandon their principle they ve abandon the british people he be right be he have say that and we can not pass this by that defection do not make up for what have be terrible week for the reform party especially when it come to shall we say hr matter the big story for reform this week be that it really be become the party of sleaze and scandal and of dud and dodgy personnel do not think this be really the right moment for it to start ditch its vetting procedure even though it have only handful of mps its chief whip seem to have have busy week than our and that be say something be not sure if reform will welcome our partnership with the french on tackle the small boat this week but it be already enthusiastically implement policy of one in one out early day motion set out how samiul ahmed buy cockermouth old courthouse for knock down price and ignore professional advice allow the list building to collapse into the river cocker that this house note in july samiul ahmed of tower hamlets purchase the grade ii list old courthouse cockermouth building with an annual income of believe to be worth for the reduce price of due to riverbank erosion and the need for major structural repair far note that in pursuit of quick profit ahmed arrange structural survey and associated work but on learn of the extent of wide liability and ignore professional advice have support prop remove lead to major deterioration and collapse of portion of the building into the river cocker in october also note that after three year the building remain unsupported partial ruin note that the environment agency map increase flood risk to cockermouth as result and express concern that the front of the building be also undermine and at risk of collapse observe that ahmed fail to pay contractor have be successfully sue for by one local company and that he have conspire to avoid liability by arrange transfer of his personal ownership of the building to different legal entity halal group believe that ahmed be now seek to transfer responsibility to cumberland council taxpayer potential bill which could range between and million assert it should not be the responsibility of taxpayer to pick up the liability of person whose motivation have be property speculation for quick profit and call upon mr ahmed to fund the restoration cost so it be disappointing to hear the owner on radio cumbria this morning continue to blame the council my message to mr ahmed be publish your plan and prove you can finance they and do it quick before the town flood through your inaction would the leader of the house agree that debate on council power to deal with greedy incompetent property speculator be well overdue thank my hon friend for raise this important constituency case he be absolutely right that we need more accountability and we need community to have more power over these vital local asset that be exactly what we will be do when we introduce the english devolution and community empowerment bill later call the liberal democrat spokesperson yesterday lbc publish month long investigative story on special educational need and disability shockingly it reveal that family have be send legal cease and desist letter in attempt by some school and local authority to deter parent from seek education health and care plan for their child with send the report uncover that some parent and the independent send advocate assist they have be threaten with legal action and with be report to the police simply for dare to ask question about the send provision to which their child be entitle but that be not be deliver let we be very clear send child and their family have legal right to support and be sure that the whole house would agree that attempt to prevent or limit the provision of such assistance particularly through intimidatory tactic be completely unacceptable we all know that the send system be fundamentally break and that reform be need that be why the liberal democrats set out our five principle for send reform in england yesterday principle no be ensure that child and family voice be at the heart of the reform process indeed the prime minister say yesterday that he want to work with parent and teacher to get this right official report july vol will the leader of the house ask the secretary of state for education to make statement explain exactly how their voice be be not just hear but understand as part of the send reform process and will she join in condemn the outrageous practice of issue legal threat to parent who be simply try to do their good for their child thank the hon lady for raise that important issue which know she and many in her party care deeply about as do most on the government benches as she say think it be widely accept we inherit send system in crisis think any parent or any constituency mp who have be support family through this system know that it be break and need address join she in highlight the lbc investigation which have really shine light on some of these issue on the process reassure the hon lady that we absolutely want to and will build consensus on these issue we have be very clear about that we will be work with parent teacher campaigner and professional right across the system to develop those reform and to fix the system which be much need we will continue that engage dialogue over the summer before publish white paper in the autumn that white paper will of course be follow by all the process and discussion that would normally follow will ensure that the house be keep update throughout at time when just of the uk

water company operate in their constituency frankly some of the bad behaviour of those water company have go on for too long and there have not be enough accountability or action on the issue that matter to we all that be why we bring in the water special measures act and establish the commission on the future of water governance further legislation on this matter will come forward in due course thank the leader of the house for her response this morning resident doctor industrial action with your permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on plan industrial action by resident doctor today waiting list figure show that after year of decline the nhs be finally move in the right direction since july we have cut waiting list by we promise to deliver an extra million appointment in our first year and have more than double that figure deliver million more appointment for the first time in year waiting list fall in the month of may and they now stand at their low level in more than two year that be what can happen when nhs staff and labour government work together we have put the nhs on the road to recovery but we all know that it be still hang by thread and that the bma be threaten to pull that thread on tuesday this week meet the co chair of the bma resident doctor committee to discuss the result of its ballot for industrial action in that meeting and in letter send yesterday offer to meet the bma full resident doctor committee and work with it to improve its member work life since the start of this year have offer repeatedly to meet the entire committee but it still have not take up my offer instead of agree to talk the bma respond by announce five day of strike action its planned strike action will run from am on friday july to am on wednesday july these strike be unnecessary give this government willingness and eagerness to work together to improve resident doctor work condition follow pay rise thank to the action of this government the bma threaten industrial action be entirely unreasonable be ask it again today to pause call off the strike and instead work with the government to rebuild its member work condition and rebuild our nhs before this government come into office toxic combination of conservative mismanagement and strike be cripple the nhs the cost to the nhs run to billion in just one year patient see million operation and appointment cancel and people life be ruin phoebe suffer from genetic condition neurofibromatosis which cause non cancerous tumour on the outside of her body her first operation at great ormond street hospital be cancel twice at first due to strike and then because there be not the capacity to treat she phoebe love go to school and it be an absolute tragedy that her education be set back she be prevent from do what she love because the nhs be not there for she when she need it but this year when phoebe family contact great ormond street in march her surgery be schedule less than two week later compare with what she go through two year ago the difference be night and day that be the difference labour government make and it be why this government be absolutely right to end the strike when we come to office be so proud of what we have achieve together with nhs staff in the word of one nhs leader speak to recently there be light at the end of the tunnel and for the first time it be not an oncoming train that have only be possible because of the deal this government negotiate when we agree that deal to end the strike last year resident doctor do not just receive pay rise the government also give genuine commitment to build new partnership with those we now call resident doctor base on mutual respect have personally ensure that that commitment be follow through new exception reporting process have be agree with resident doctor in principle so that doctor be pay for the work they be ask to do review of rotational training be under way and almost complete to reduce disruption to resident doctor life we promise to tackle gp unemployment and we have deliver with an extra gps on the frontline who be otherwise face unemployment be determined to go far to tackle doctor unemployment when say to resident doctor that want to tackle the bottleneck they face and the unfair competition for specialty training place and to create more training place they can judge not just by my word but by my action when the pay review body recommend average pay rise for resident doctor this year we accept that and fund it in full those be not ground for industrial action indeed in the history of british trade union it be completely unprecedented for pay rise of to be meet with strike the bma itself describe this pay rise as generous thank to this government the average annual earning per first year resident doctor last year be that be significantly more in resident doctor first year than the average full time worker in this country and it be set to increase far with this year pay award for resident doctor in their second year out of medical school their average annual earning rise to last year in core training year resident doctor earn an average of specialty registrar earn on average almost there be no question but that these be highly train highly skilled medic who work hard for their money but to threaten strike in these circumstance be unreasonable and unnecessary so it be no wonder that the bma have lose the public support at the beginning of this dispute resident doctor face conservative government cut their pay and refuse to talk to they clear majority support action as result in february of the public back junior doctor strike today that support have collapse just one in five people believe that the bma be do the right thing patient be beg resident doctor not to walk out on they and hope the bma be listen because many resident doctor be for the first time since the bma campaign begin majority of bma resident doctor do not vote for strike action they can see that the government have change and our approach have change yet the bma tactic have not resident doctor have receive the high pay award in the public sector both this year and last year so renegotiate this year pay award would be deeply unfair to all other public servant such deal would be pay for by their future earning and with the great respect to resident doctor there be people work in our public service who be feel the pinch more than they be even if it would not be unfair on public sector worker it be unaffordable it should be apparent to anyone that the public finance this government inherit be not awash with cash so will not and can not negotiate on this year pay award and be not go to lead resident doctor up the garden path by make promise unless know can keep they as have say in person in writing in private and in public be willing and ready to get around the table and work together to improve the work condition of resident doctor there be so much more that we can do together do not just hear the complaint that resident doctor have about their placement rotation and bottleneck agree with they know the nhs have be bad employer and be determined to change it my offer to talk come with no precondition attach will also say this to resident doctor directly consider very carefully the consequence of your action order may suggest to the secretary of state that his statement have already take minute and he have not ask for additional time do he wish to consider whether his statement be to the house or to those outside the house he might like to make few closing remark thank you madam deputy speaker will move to closing do share the statement in advance include with opposition party and the speaker office just say to resident doctor and it be important that the house know what we be say to they that they should carefully consider the consequence of their action five day of strike action mean patient and their family receive the phone call they be currently dread be tell that the operation or appointment they have be wait for often for far too long be be cancel and delay know how would feel if that happen to member of my family and ask they to consider how they would feel if that happen to member of theirs while they be out on the picket line protest the pay increase they have have their friend and colleague and other nhs staff many of whom be pay less and receive less than they will be inside pick up the piece and work in hard condition to cover for the consequence of resident doctor action in conclusion the strike be not only unnecessary and unreasonable but unfair they be unfair on patient unfair on other nhs staff and unfair to the future of the nhs which be in jeopardy the tragedy be that they will never have have secretary of state as sympathetic to their legitimate complaint as this one if they want to know what the alternative be its member be not sit here they have not even bother to show up today and that party do not even believe in the nhs the grass be not green on the other side ask they not to squander this opportunity at this stage we can still come out of this dispute with win for the bma member win for the nhs and win for patient but if the bma continue down the path of strike action it will lose its campaign resident doctor will be bad off and the heavy price of all will be pay by patient commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state be grateful to the secretary of state for his typical courtesy and advance sight of his statement also note that he be among the most assiduous of ministers in volunteer himself to this house to be question on issue of importance be however afraid it come as no surprise that we be here today discuss likely industrial action on this government watch last year we warn the government that cave in to union demand for above inflation pay rise without any condition or string attach would set dangerous precedent it would send message that the government be weak and we warn that the union would simply come back for more unfortunately event in recent day have show that we be right the public will be understandably concerned about what this industrial action will mean for they and the provision of local nhs service for patient with an appointment schedule or even on waiting list that concern will be particularly acute let be clear this bma strike action as the secretary of state have say it be support by less than of those eligible to vote be irresponsible wrong and unnecessary on that agree with the secretary of state will the secretary of state enlarge on the additional step that he be take to seek to resolve the industrial dispute and prevent the strike action from go ahead hear what he say about his willingness to talk do he anticipate further meeting before strike start on july and do he anticipate risk of any other part of the nhs workforce ballot for strike action if this strike action do take place what step be be put in place to minimise disruption what be the plan to protect patient who will need to access nhs service over this period and can the secretary of state guarantee that emergency cover will remain and that there will be minimum service level in place more broadly and base on the previous strike how many appointment do the government anticipate be at risk of be cancel or postpone and have he assess what impact the decision by the bma will have on his aim of reduce waiting list and meet his week target the previous chief financial officer of nhs england say that nearly all the money allocate to the nhs at the autumn budget will be eat up by nhs pay settlement the national insurance hike and increase inflationary cost just to maintain service at their exist level follow the recent spending review and the chancellor announcement of additional funding how much of that do the secretary of state anticipate will be spend on staffing cost include the already agree pay award and the national insurance increase and how much of it will actually make it to the frontline in the form of additional care or to fund the reform that he set out recently what do the secretary of state anticipate will be the long last impact of strike action on relation between the government and trade union in the health space the year plan be publish just last week as say at the time it be sensible and be supportive of what he have set out in that but concern have be raise about its deliverability the secretary of state have say previously that he will need to work with the union to deliver on the plan be he still confident that that will be possible do he believe that they will agree to the change that be require or be there risk of further strike action over the come year because doctor have sense weakness in opposition the secretary of state have some very strong and well articulate view on industrial action he say strike action be play politic with our nhs on that agree with he he say that the government ought to be pull out all the report december vol and that the power to stop these strike be in the government hand official report december vol he be the secretary of state now do he agree that the power to stop these strike be in his hand our message to the government be clear the secretary of state need to do what he have say he will do face down union pressure and deliver an affordable settlement that be fair to staff patient and crucially taxpayer on his watch resident doctor be set to leave the frontline to go on to the picket line whether that happen will be down to he sadly labour weakness be fuel this crisis if the government do not get grip now summer of discontent and strike risk turn into summer of chaos and it will be patient who pay the price think the shadow secretary of state memory be let he down let just remind he that before the general election and after month of refuse to meet the bma the conservative finally enter negotiation but not before strike be leave to run and run at cost of billion to the taxpayer and million operation appointment and procedure be cancel they also offer the bma junior doctor pay rise which be only about of the pay rise that we eventually agree imagine what would have happen if the conservatives have pull their finger out and get the doctor around the table soon and have not be quite so intransigent the shadow secretary of state be right to say that criticise my predecessor for their unwillingness to negotiate the difference between and they be that have act resident doctor have have pay increase thank to the decision that have take as secretary of state with the support of the entire government they have secretary of state who do not slam the door in their face but who be open to work with they to improve their condition the responsibility for these strike lie squarely with those run the bma resident doctor committee despite fail to get majority of their member to vote for strike action for the first time in their campaign they be still propose to lead their member out on five day strike they even make the announcement on the day that have already write to they to suggest that we meet to avert unnecessary strike action the shadow secretary of state be right to talk about the jeopardy face the future because we produce our year plan in partnership with patient the public and nhs staff there be not only much in it that resident doctor should welcome but much that they suggest our year workforce plan will set out training education and retention of the workforce and we will work closely with resident doctor on standard they should start to experience an improvement in their working condition on everything from the availability of nutritious food and drink to reduce violence against staff and tackle discrimination we have already commit to prioritise uk graduate for training and we have start conversation on contractual reform with trade union across the board we be determined to recruit more people locally and to tackle social disadvantage access to medicine and all the issue that be at the forefront of the mind of resident doctor such as placement rotation and future career progression include specialty bottleneck absolutely want to work with they these be not condition for strike these be condition to work in partnership with the government just as other nhs union and so many other trade union across the public sector do say to resident doctor once more that sit in front of be the ghost of christmas past reform its member be not in their place today be the ghost of christmas future perhaps bma member might consider that they be lucky to have the ghost of christmas present in front of they be glad the secretary of state have remind conservative members that they have rather short term memory when take my place in this house last year thousand of my resident in gloucester be on nhs waiting list many of they for long than month since this labour government take power last year the number have come down by in part thank to the hard work of resident doctor in my constituency do the secretary of state agree that strike action by the bma will put that recovery at risk will he invite its member to meet my resident who be still on the waiting list leave behind by the conservative party so that they can explain why the pay rise which many of my constituent will not receive this year be not enough completely agree with my hon friend urge bma member to consider not just the significant progress that they have already make by work with labour government but the wide context in which we be operate it be not just resident doctor who have see their pay erode over more than decade of conservative government it be the entire public sector it be not just resident doctor who be work in crumble building with out of date equipment and technology it be the same in our school our hospital our prison and the entire public sector estate this government be face enormous challenge across our economy and we can not sort out every issue that we inherit overnight or even in one year it be go to take time bma member should be proud of the progress that we have make together and reassure that we want to make further progress with they but there have to be some give and take here and there have to be some reasonableness give the potential consequence of their action for patient for their fellow staff and for the future of the nhs the strike action be unreasonable unnecessary and deeply unfair call the liberal democrat spokesperson people across the country and nhs patient in particular will be disappoint to hear of yet more strike action by resident doctor this july especially after the immense disruption of recent year and my liberal democrat colleague fully recognise that this dispute do not come out of nowhere the previous conservative government leave our nhs under unbearable strain with doctor work under intense pressure in crumble hospital and often without the resource they need my constituent and people across the country need and deserve well function nhs over the past three year doctor have receive pay rise follow early strike the bma be now call for further increase but we have to be honest after year of economic mismanagement by the conservatives the public finance be in dire state that kind of increase do not feel affordable or realistic right now that say we can not ignore the reality of work condition in our nhs doctor be expect to save life in collapse ward and to deliver care in corridor rather than in safe clinical setting it be degrading and dangerous for both staff and patient we need constructive dialogue not escalation to resolve this dispute swiftly and fairly and most importantly we need urgent action to rebuild our nhs and restore work condition that our doctor and patient can be proud of first will the secretary of state improve staff morale by commit to end the dangerous and dehumanising practice of corridor care secondly do he not see that by drag out social care reform delay discharge and corridor care be only go to worsen doctor experience of work in the nhs weaken morale and lower care standard be grateful to the liberal democrat spokesperson and think can reassure she on number of front first she be absolutely right to call out the disgrace that be corridor care despite the good effort of staff who suffer the moral injury of treat patient in that situation in too many part of the nhs we have patient be treat on trolley in corridor in this decade of the century think that be unacceptable as be the emerge nomenclature that have start to describe these as temporary escalation space because we be in danger of normalise what should be consider unacceptable practice that be why this government will shortly begin transparently publish corridor care datum show the number of patient be treat on trolley in corridor be sure there will be moment when that might cause ministers and nhs leader to blush but frankly until corridor care be consign to history so we should sunlight be the good disinfectant and by publish the datum we will hold ourselves to account and be sure this house will hold we to account to ensure that we deliver the condition that staff and patient deserve also reassure the hon member that while the casey commission be under way work on social care go on whether that be the billion increase in investment in social care through the decision take by my right hon friend the chancellor or other improvement such as to carer allowance the disabled facility grant and uplift in funding for local authority however be also committed to ensure that as we improve the flow of patient through our hospital and deal with the scourge of delay discharge we be lot well at think about how we use the taxpayer pound to good effect to deliver the right care in the right place and at the right time that will often mean use nhs resource to commission social care to help tackle delay discharge and we will be keep close eye on that finally thank the hon member for join the voice of reason in this chamber hope it be not lose on the bma and resident doctor watch that this be not case of an intransigent government unwilling to work with and support they who be try to face down for political and ideological purpose trade union speak up for its member this labour government have deliver pay increase and we be willing to work far to improve condition for resident doctor that work can start now and be ready to meet the bma immediately there be other voice of reason in this chamber include among the liberal democrats who recognise the pressure on the public finance they recognise that we be try to do many thing across the nhs that will also directly benefit resident doctor such as make sure they have the right kit and be work in decent building we be improve the condition that they be work in and that patient be treat in so that together we be build in work in and be treat in an improve nhs that be the prize and that prize be be throw into jeopardy by the resident doctor action if they go down this path with all of the consequence that will follow be afraid for they let alone for the nhs and for the country thing will get bad rather than well and urge they not to take that course of action do my right hon friend agree that we be right to settle the strike last year for the sake of ensure the future of the nhs protect the interest of the public and show our doctor that they be value that that will always be his position and that it be therefore somewhat surprising that resident doctor have decide to call this strike strongly agree with my hon friend he be absolutely right be happy to stand correct but there be genuinely no historical precedent in the history of british trade unionism for trade union to have successfully negotiate with the government of the day increase for its member and then go out on strike think that undermine the bma and the more reasonable voice in the bma with whom we continue to work constructively it certainly undermine our nhs it also reinforce the grossly unfair caricature which be often throw at trade union by the conservatives that they be all unreasonable do not want to work with the government of the day and be only interested in combat and agitation in my experience the vast majority of trade union and trade unionist be interested in constructive engagement strike good deal and move forward the interest not just of their member but of our whole country urge the bma resident doctor committee to stand in that proud tradition of british trade unionism and in the proud tradition of the wide labour movement but be afraid do not see those tradition or behaviour reflect in the current approach of the bma rdc we can all argue about the past but if it help the secretary of state think we should just say today that the whole house absolutely support he in his robust attitude hon member hear hear of course we all love doctor but the start salary be not so very bad they have job very good job for life which most people do not have and he could also mention that they have much well career structure than most people far high proportion of they get the top job namely as consultant and the consultant start salary of year be not bad whack first think that the right hon member opening statement and the response across the house underline to the bma and the resident doctor committee that they do not have support across this house from the left across to the right with maybe one or two noise off and that be not typical in my experience of be in this house for the last decade think the career of resident doctor and the prospect they can look forward to which the right hon member describe have worsen that be one of the thing that be at the heart of the dispute they have take up with the previous government and now with this one many of the thing doctor use to be able to look forward to guarantee job and progression into consultant role or general practice have steadily erode we have far too much doctor unemployment and far too many specialty bottleneck we have what think be really unreasonable set of behaviour towards resident doctor in term of placement rotation and the ability to take time off work to attend wedding and other important life moment the tragedy of the position we find ourselves in be that recognise that and want to address it we can do that together without the need for strike action and those be not reason for strike worse still especially at time when be prioritise deal with doctor unemployment they be inflict further cost on the nhs patient and the taxpayer that make my freedom and flexibility and my resource to deal with those issue more limited that be the tragedy of their tactic thank the secretary of state for his statement and the ongoing work to get the nhs back on its foot after it be push to the brink under the previous government strike inevitably have financial and human cost to they and the next round of strike will undoubtedly have that too mean that the nhs will take financial hit can he share the impact that this will have on the system for example can he guarantee that the cost of these strike will not lead to job cut in all honesty be afraid can not give my hon friend that assurance nhs finance be precariously balanced we have be relative winner across the budget and the spending review set out by my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer but we be ask lot of the system as well as the progress and improvement we want in the nhs we inherit lot of mess to clean up and that will take time and resource every penny spend on the price of failure through strike action be penny that could have be spend on drive improvement in the service improvement for patient and for staff and on create the job and opportunity that mean doctor do not graduate into unemployment and that mean resident doctor can progress into specialty training post that be why say clearly and unequivocally to the bma that if this strike action go ahead with all the cost pain and misery that will follow it will not just be patient or indeed this government who suffer but the bma have know the secretary of state long time know he before he be an important man although he be always important to of course he will know that as minister work with the trade union in every sector for which be responsible as the rmt and the university and college union will confirm and be also member of the association of teachers and lecturers entirely endorse and amplify what he say responsible trade unionism require people to be reasonable and reasonable people in this house know that this strike against this background be entirely unacceptable as he have describe ask the secretary of state this will he ensure that this unhappy unwholesome and unhealthy action do not jeopardise the health of my constituent and will he write to the local authority the integrate care board in my area and other to set out how they can minimise the impact of this action the last thing that you want madam deputy speaker or that or any member across this house want be for those at risk to be put at great risk as result of this irresponsible action by these militant people thank the right hon gentleman for his question he be that rare beast tory trade unionist he raise the serious point of the consequence of strike action will of course keep the house update but want to reassure the house that we be take every step possible to mitigate the disruption that these strike will cause that will come at financial cost and cost to patient because of the disruption that will follow it will also come at cost to other staff many of whom be pay less than resident doctor who will be leave at work with more pressure and in hard condition pick up the piece because of the action of their colleague who be give high pay rise but who will be stand outside protest the pay rise that they receive assure the house that we will do everything we can to mitigate the impact of the strike on patient and the disruption that will follow what can not say to the house however be that we can offset or cancel the impact or detriment feel by patient we will look carefully at the datum on the experience and impact of the strike that occur during the previous round of negotiation will ensure that that information be publish so that the house can see the impact of the previous strike so that we can brace ourselves for what may lie ahead anyone who have ever work in healthcare know that it be team sport and that deliver excellent care require range of staff across the allied health profession include nurse doctor administrative staff and estate staff do the secretary of state agree that it be therefore essential that all nhs staff group have confidence that their pay be be set fairly and that go beyond the independent pay review body recommendation for one set of staff would undermine the one nhs team ethos that so many have work to build strongly agree with what my hon friend say have be personally invest in our relationship with resident doctor and in the deal we strike not just because it be one of the first thing we do when we come into office and because be very proud of what we have achieve together but because have and still have huge amount of support and sympathy for resident doctor and determination to address the issue they be raise however reassure my hon friend and the house that resident doctor be one part of the nhs workforce value part but have responsibility for the entire workforce we set ourselves the task of build an nhs fit for the future but we can not do it on our own as government it require the whole team to pull together will be honest with my hon friend feel considerable degree of discomfort when look back at whole number of deal and pay award under this government and our predecessor where the agenda for change workforce have be leave far behind will be honest with the house at this moment have to resolve the immediate action that be be propose by the bma but be not go to allow the reform we have commit to with the agenda for change union to be deprioritise we owe that to they we owe it to the nurse and to all the agenda for change staff to ensure that they be pay fairly be give fair day pay for fair day work and receive the term and condition that they deserve my priority at this stage be the agenda for change reform of course will do everything can to resolve the resident doctor strike but what can not do be reopen this year pay award rise remind hon member and the secretary of state that we have an important statement to come as well as two backbench business debate may we have short question and short answer agree with the secretary of state when he tell the bma resident doctor that they will never have another secretary of state as sympathetic to their legitimate complaint recognise that have work with five of his predecessor my experience tell that what happen here with the bma often filter through to the devolved nation what engagement have he have with his counterpart on the propose industrial action so that there can be combine resolution and message to the bma reassure the hon gentleman that will obviously engage with my counterpart in the devolved administration while health be devolved matter the decision that we take in this place and what be go on in the english health system have bearing on other health system and vice versa be almost tempt to call back the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay who be still member of this house to remind the bma what it go up against twice before indeed could call back any of my conservative predecessor to remind the bma that the grass be not green on the other side of this house it currently have secretary of state who have show through action not just word willingness to work together and hope that it rediscover the spirit of partnership that we have last year we all know how vital resident doctor be to the functioning of our national health service in the light of that will the secretary of state join in once again urge the bma resident doctor committee to get back around the table to engage in serious talk and to take up his offer to meet in the interest of all nhs staff and patient so that we can rebuild the national health service in the way the public expect quite aside from the fact that offer to meet the entire resident doctor committee back in january although it have never take up on that offer would definitely be outnumber in that meeting can reassure the house in all seriousness that meet its co chair on tuesday afternoon immediately after the publication of the ballot result follow up in writing yesterday morning to reaffirm what say in person which be to express our willingness to meet immediately without precondition to avert this strike action that offer remain and be very happy to meet they on that basis my wife have long term chronic health condition she have have to have two major lifesaving surgery and have have countless stay in hospital we have see the fantastic work that many doctor and consultant do but we have also see the impact it have when there be cancellation and delay or when no doctor be available many people will have be flabbergast by the sheer scale of the pay rise that be award in the first place without anything in return to deliver the nhs reform that the government seek those people will now be absolutely outraged that the bma be go on strike after have near pay increase plead with the secretary of state to hold the line in these negotiation and to take away the cross party support he have in hold the line against the bma on this issue we will not be reopen this year pay award because we simply can not afford to and it would not be fair on other in the nhs workforce regardless honestly do not regret the deal that we strike last year without which we would not have make the progress that we have on nhs waiting list which be now at their low level in two year we have make that considerable progress by work together do not think that the staff themselves be the drain on productivity instead the obstacle we face be the system and pathway in which staff work and the condition in the nhs we be in real agreement on those thing urge the bma to keep all that under consideration before its next public intervention which hope will be to accept the offer to get around the table to avert the strike action that think the whole house agree be unnecessary unreasonable and unfair thank my right hon friend for his statement which be deliver with the humility and pragmatism that be his usual professional style after pay rise thank to this labour government do the secretary of state agree that the public be not only dismay by the action of the bma but distraught and that once again it will be the patient who will suffer the most by this action which be so unnecessary at this particular moment entirely agree with my hon friend it will be patient who suffer the most also urge the bma to consider the impact on its whole membership because it be other staff who be leave pick up the piece and other staff who be tired literally tired of work in an nhs that be far from its good to resident doctor in particular say that the cost of this will also be bear by they there be choice and trade off in politic especially when resource be tight we can and we will act to deal with specialty bottleneck we can and we will act to tackle doctor unemployment but our ability to do so be undermine if not diminish if we be instead pay the cost of this unnecessary unreasonable and unfair strike action thank the secretary of state for his statement today and fully support the line of action that he have take indication that the majority of doctor in the bma do not vote to strike make this strike action even more difficult to understand the secretary of state be clearly try to find way forward the way to do that be through find solution review condition of work such as those that see junior doctor work hour within the space of week would be helpful perhaps this action be not only about pay but about the expectation of these young people who have life and death in their hand for hour for six out of seven day week the hon gentleman make an entirely reasonable point pay be important people have to be able to pay their bill and lead good life but so too be their working condition be absolutely determined to work with resident doctor to make progress not just on pay which we have already do but on the condition in which they be work give where we be with both of those thing the improvement on pay and the willingness to work together to improve condition they be not ground for strike action congratulate my right hon friend on show great leadership when he come into office to get those doctor back to work and end the strike the result of that have be fall waiting time and waiting list and have see the benefit of that for my constituent in shipley they be not have to wait for operation and diagnostic test in the nhs do he agree that this be no time for strike action and that should the bma and the resident doctor go ahead with this strike this will adversely affect patient and waiting time entirely agree with my hon friend look back at all the contribution this morning have be strike by the fact that quite extraordinarily the entire house on both side of the chamber have speak with one voice there have be total unanimity across this house during these exchange that the propose strike be unreasonable unnecessary and unfair for the avoidance of doubt let tell the bma and the resident doctor committee that this house have speak with one voice to say abandon this rush to strike get around the table and work with we to rebuild resident doctor work condition and to continue rebuild our national health service thank the house for its support thank the secretary of state for his statement today electricity market review with permission madam deputy speaker shall make statement about the review of electricity market arrangement the central challenge that we face be the urgent need to get off expensive insecure fossil fuel and to deliver an energy system that meet at least double the level of current electricity demand by in do so we need to design the electricity network to ensure that infrastructure be build in the right place so that we can effectively provide power where it be require as result of previous failure to do so power now go to waste cost consumer in high bill that be one reason why reform be need the task of this review be to help deliver fair affordable secure and efficient clean power system the key question have be whether to proceed with zonal pricing or reform national system under zonal pricing we would split the country into different zone rely on price differential to guide investment decision under reform national price system we would rely on more deliberate strategic co ordination in advance of investment plan our network and area of intended generation more closely and then deliver have apply three test to this choice in the time since the government take office first what be the fair approach for family and business both now and in the long term secondly which reform can deliver energy security and will well protect consumer and ensure bill saving as soon as possible and thirdly what will do most to ensure the investment job and growth that we need across the economy on the basis of these test have conclude that the right approach be reform national pricing let set out why on the fairness test under reform national pricing there would be one national wholesale price as now as have say under zonal pricing there would be different wholesale price in different zone low price will tend to occur in zone with more renewable energy and small population and high price in those with less power and more people this would be significant departure from the current system which while it have some difference in network cost mean that wherever person live they pay the same wholesale price for each unit of electricity the challenge will be obvious to the house people and business could find themselves disadvantage through no fault of their own and many would see that as unfair such postcode lottery be in my view difficult to defend the government have consider whether it would be possible to mitigate these effect under zonal pricing we have conclude that while it might it would be very complex and uncertain process and it would be even more challenging to do so for large business give the way that they purchase electricity therefore firm in high price zone such as the midland wales and the south of england would therefore face damage to their competitiveness that be why we have see so many business group express such concern about zonal pricing indeed today decision have already be welcome by uk steel make uk the british chamber of commerce ceramics uk and other the next test that apply be which system can good help deliver energy security protect consumer and ease the cost of live crisis as soon as possible long term reform be essential to cut cost and save money for consumer compare with the status quo but there be key question as to what happen in the meantime the clear advice of my department be that move towards zonal pricing would take around seven year to complete in full assume no delay over that seven year period the cost of finance essential investment in our energy system would be likely to rise to accommodate investor uncertainty at moment when we urgently need to replace retire asset and build clean energy system to boost our energy security this risk premium would be pay for by consumer in high bill in the come year there be also danger that it would leave we stick on fossil fuel for long by deter investor from bring forward the investment that we need for our energy security by contrast reform national pricing could be deliver more quickly and at low risk indeed some element of reform national pricing system be already under way include build network infrastructure and we intend to proceed with other measure such as reform of transmission charge as soon as possible in this parliament have study this in detail over month see real risk that zonal pricing would deter the investment we need and that bill would rise in the transitional period the third test be the investment and growth we need as country many business make decision to invest base on the energy cost that they face the industrial strategy take crucial step forward in lower the cost face by business and clean power will help get we off the fossil fuel rollercoaster which have so damage our country business we know that the big enemy of business investment be uncertainty and the risk of zonal pricing be that it would create very significant uncertainty imagine business seek to invest not know for number of year what zone it would be in and what price it would pay this would harm investment not just in the energy sector but well beyond it and it would inevitably risk reduce investment in our country precisely when we need it and undermine the ten of thousand of good job in constituency across the country that our clean energy mission will support on the basis of those three test believe that the good choice be to proceed with reform national pricing the key element will include effective planning through the strategic spatial energy plan to be publish next year national pricing reform such as make transmission charge more effective and predictable and take relevant power through parliament to do so and make change work with the national energy system operator and ofgem to improve the operation of flexibility and the balancing of market under reform national pricing we will build the transmission network we need to the benefit of all consumer and we will be more directive and co ordinated in how we plan our energy system each upgrade that we deliver will reduce constraint cost and ensure that consumer benefit from clean power my department will set out reform national pricing delivery plan later this year take together believe that these step can help to deliver more affordable fair secure and efficient energy system and will address the problem that the rema process set out to solve without the unacceptable risk have outline these step build on what we have do over the past year to turbocharge our drive to home grow clean power we have consent three time more solar in month than in the previous year we have lift the onshore wind ban and consent enough offshore wind to power the equivalent of million home we have back the big expansion of new nuclear in half century we be kick start new industry in carbon capture and hydrogen we be give nearly million extra family off their energy bill next winter and upgrade up to million home to help cut bill every energy decision that this government make be in pursuit of protect the british people from fossil fuel market control by petrostate and dictator by deliver clean home grow power that we control it be in that spirit that we have choose reform national pricing we be do everything we can to ensure energy security protect consumer and get bill down and to ensure that business can invest for the future this be underpin by commitment to fairness across the country commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement know that this have be difficult decision for he he tell everyone that his flagship mission be to commission more renewable power than ever before by more wind than ever before and fast than ever before in market that be already face supply chain challenge and soar cost say at the time that it be completely unfeasible but that if he be go to do it he should take every opportunity to minimise the grid infrastructure that need to be build and the cost of his plan on the other hand know that he will have have wind developer tell he that if he take those decision and make those choice they will not be bid into his auction in the next couple of year the auction he need they to bid into so that he can meet his self impose target because they want to protect their return when face with choice between protect the profit of wind developer and cut bill for the british people the secretary of state have choose the wind developer who know that they have he over barrel in set himself an unachievable target that be base on ideology and ideology alone he be tell those wind developer that he have to buy whatever they be sell no matter the price little over year ago the secretary of state tell the country that bill would come down by up to but his statement today show that when push come to shove he will choose high bill for the british people to fund profit for renewable energy company worse still what he do not mention be that today announcement mean high bill to pay wind farm billion in constraint payment not to produce energy but simply to switch off have warn the secretary of state repeatedly about the risk of build more wind before grid and ask he to continue my work on what full system cost of energy would look like which include the cost of back up and constraint payment but he do not listen he ax that work because he do not want to know what those cost be instead last year he sign we up to the most expensive wind price in decade at about per megawatt hour that be almost high than the average cost of electricity for the last year which have be about per megawatt hour this year price will probably be the same if not high and he want to extend those contract to year he have not explain how lock we into much high price for long will bring down bill but low bill be what he have promise the british public there be more the secretary of state plan require more grid to be build fast than before that mean on to household bill his plan mean that constraint payment for wind farm to switch off will rise to billion that mean on to bill now we read that we will be pay solar farm to switch off when it be sunny too and the office for budget responsibility say that green levy will rise by billion people may have notice that the secretary of state use to talk lot about cheap energy but now talk about less volatile price what his back benchers need to realise be that most people would not swap variable rate mortgage for an fix one what they care about be the price of their bill and they want cheap price if he be truly interested in bring down bill he would not have scrap the analysis that start last year to find out the true cost of system dominate by wind and solar have now read twice in one week that downing street be start to pressure the secretary of state about when his plan might actually bring down bill all can say be share the feeling before repeat all the empty promise about cut bill by downing street might have want to ask where his evidence be but will ask he now will he reinstate that cost of energy work so that we can clearly see the difference between the system will he set out road map to show exactly how he will lower bill will he confirm that he will not sign up to price in this year wind auction that be high than the current average cost of electricity can he also confirm whether he see full cost benefit analysis of the choice in front of he today and do he share the view of ofgem and neso will leave the secretary of state with two quote the chief executive of octopus energy one of the country big advocate of renewable have say that the secretary of state plan mean soar cost lock in for year to come and more on the way and the more we build the bad it get for year he also say it brutal for family and cripple for growth think the secretary of state say in his statement that the big problem for business be uncertainty but it be not it be high energy cost the second quote perhaps the most revealing come from one of his close adviser his chief energy system adviser who say if we procure lot and lot of renewable generation and then we do not build the grid that allow it to get to market we will be waste lot and lot of money could not have put it well myself this be the first time be at the dispatch box opposite the shadow secretary of state congratulate she on her new baby boy and welcome she back to the house of commons know from my own personal experience that cry at night be challenging but who be surprised give the state of the conservative party think the shadow secretary of state and have number of difference the fundamental difference be this she want to gamble in the fossil fuel casino she want to gamble on fossil fuel price that be what the conservatives do when they be in office and it lead to the bad cost of live crisis in generation interruption the shadow secretary of state say from sedentary position that it be not true it absolutely be true and think she need to get out there more and hear what people have to say to she it ruin family finance it ruin business finance and it ruin the public finance and what do they do do the conservatives come along after their bad election defeat in year and think well maybe we get it bit wrong maybe we should think again no they double down on fail strategy that be the first point the second point be this the shadow secretary of state say that we have problem of constraint cost that it be really problem that we do not have the infrastructure that the country need she be absolutely right but who be in charge for year do just take my word for it by the way notice that her colleague the shadow energy minister the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie be not in his place but he say that it be absurd that after year of conservative government we be now in situation where it be more difficult to build critical national infrastructure than it be before they come into power and that it cost more that be what we have get the grid system be massively back up the planning system be in disrepute and the network and transmission infrastructure be not build the third point be that the shadow secretary of state now say okay well let forget about the past ignore my record airbrush it out let build the grid too right we should build the grid but she be oppose new clean energy infrastructure all around the country she be go around say oh it terrible we should be have this happen so at the level of strategy and what be the right thing for the country at the level of her record and why we be in this position and at the level of what she be do now be afraid she be in the wrong place now what be we do we be actually change all of this in the period that the shadow secretary of state have be away we have see whole set of decision make that the conservatives talk about but never deliver on nuclear power they talk lot about sizewell and small modular reactor and all that but they do not actually deliver it we be with over billion of private investment in clean power unblocked and record break renewable auction by the way the shadow secretary of state say that be somehow on the side of the wind developer no madam deputy speaker be on the side of uk steel make uk the british chambers of commerce ceramics uk and business across the country who have say that this be the right decision for the country interruption she mention bill let address that directly my strategy and my belief be that clean power system can bring down bill for good because that be that way that we lower wholesale price and get off the rollercoaster home grow clean power be the answer for britain and suggest that now she be back in her post she do some hard thinking about the past about strategy and about what be right for britain call the chair of the select committee be sure the secretary of state will not be surprised to hear say that very much welcome what he have announce he set out three priority fairness low bill include and especially in industry and business where my committee hear as recently as yesterday that energy bill be cause real concern and something of crisis in certain industry and attract investment not least ahead of auction round be sadden that the shadow secretary of state be so critical of wind generation have her letter of march to my predecessor as the chair of the select committee set out her term of reference for the consultation that the secretary of state have respond to she place great emphasis on the importance of invest in renewable so it be great shame to see her change of heart under the reform national system do the secretary of state envisage increase opportunity to use demand flexibility and to use it as fast as possible as key way of bring down energy cost for domestic and industrial consumer my hon friend speak with great expertise on these matter will come to his question but let say first that like to talk about issue on which both party have be enthusiastic we have the second large offshore wind generation in the world it be start when be secretary of state with gordon brown as prime minister and it be continue under the last government it be extraordinary that the shadow secretary of state be now abandon that and say that offshore wind be somehow the problem it be not the problem it be the solution my hon friend be right about consumer lead flexibility the key point about that be that it be voluntary and it be way for consumer to save money the shadow secretary of state mention octopus energy which be one of the pioneer of this we be in the foothill of what we can achieve here whereby consumer be empower through thing like battery solar panel heat pump and smart meter to control when they use energy much more easily to their benefit and the benefit of the system call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for share his statement in advance he be right make the uk clean energy superpower be the smart and most strategic way to free ourselves from our dependence on expensive volatile fossil fuel however as we have hear accelerate the transition to renewable alone be not enough the government have to ensure that the clean power mission ultimately bring down customer bill and create fair system for household and business energy bill in the uk be among the high in europe our high cost exacerbate cost of living pressure and increase fuel poverty they also undermine our international competitiveness for industrial and commercial consumer and risk drive some business overseas the liberal democrats have long call for electricity price to be decouple from the wholesale price of gas so that family in the uk be not leave pay over the odd for clean british generate electricity just because of volatile global gas price we will be look closely at the detail of the government plan follow the review of electricity market arrangement the secretary of state outline his three test to ensure that british consumer be not expose to an unknown level of risk will he publish his cost benefit analysis and set out what impact the change will have on customer bill we will also be look keenly for the much need joined up approach between planning for renewable energy infrastructure through the strategic spatial energy plan and the land use framework and local area energy plan which worryingly be bit out of sync renewable energy can be the cheap most secure source of power but for many people see and feel it in their pocket be believe and under the current system many be struggle to see it alongside the change announce today hope the secretary of state will consider other liberal democrat proposal just as they do when put into practice our proposal for rooftop solar on all roof we would like to see free insulation and heat pump for people on low income and the introduction of social tariff for energy to protect the most vulnerable thank the hon lady for her question there be not necessarily monopoly on good idea on the whole idea of new build housing have rooftop solar instal as standard the last labour government be go to do it in but it get abolish by the previous government it be an absolute no brainer it actually unite people whether they like solar on land or not so it be really good that we be do that on decouple absolutely that be part of what clean power will do gas will set the price much less often than it do at the moment and we will be move to contract for difference rather than renewable obligation which mean that the reduction in price will feed through to consumer that be key we will publish the cost benefit analysis later in the year as our document publish today state the hon lady be right about the ssep which to be fair be start under the previous government and will be publish next year that will be crucial way in which we guide where the new infrastructure be build precisely to get over the problem of the disconnect between the generation we need and the network infrastructure as member of the select committee enjoy that can give wry smile every single week when academic non governmental organisation consumer group and industry say they have so much delay and faffe from the conservative party and now we be get on and deliver on zonal pricing it be fantastic to see that we be give some certainty to the market and thank the secretary of state in particular for set out that we be go to start tackle excessive transmission charge in northamptonshire green hill solar be bring forward massive opportunity for clean power right on my doorstep do the secretary of state agree that that type of investment and the certainty that the statement bring will create quality technical job locally in northampton and reduce people energy bill on my hon friend point about certainty which be really important global inflation have affect the offshore wind sector take it from the comment by the shadow secretary of state that we should just say well let not bother with offshore wind then let just stick to gas we just have difference of view think that would be such mistake it would leave we so exposed and we know what happen in the past on my hon friend point about job this be massive opportunity have chance recently to visit the site of the new rampion wind farm off the english coast this be go to create thousand of job as well as job in the supply chain when talk to hon member across the house be strike by how many place contribute to the supply chain and we want more of that we want those job make in britain that be the point about gb energy the national wealth fund and the clean industry bonus which will be part of auction round under the current system the most expensive generator set the clearing price for electricity push up price for consumer and business can the secretary of state explain how the reform that he be set out today change that by move to pay as bid system and provide more affordable energy for consumer and business the hon gentleman ask bang on question and that be why hope he will support clean power the key thing be that if we can get these renewable on to the system gas will set the price much less often as this be cfd rather than renewable obligation the reduction in price feed through to the consumer this will have genuinely transformative effect on the so call decouple that he and the liberal democrat spokesperson have raise congratulate my right hon friend on this package of measure which will reduce energy cost the system leave by the conservatives need to tackle three thing transmission charge constraint payment and marginal cost pricing by which the price of gas drive the cost of the whole system therefore welcome the strategic special energy plan which will see asset build close to their user and low transmission charge which comprise more than of the cost of power welcome the new transmission line and storage facility which will reduce constraint payment these be game changer but of the cost of power still come from the marginal cost of gas can my right hon friend elaborate on what he say in response to the hon member for north west norfolk james wild and tell we whether there be any plan to decouple the wholesale price of gas from the system that be the real game changer will come to my hon friend early point in minute but his last point be absolutely crucial the last government look at this and find it difficult to find mechanism to do it within the system key thing that clean power will do be that gas will set the price much less of the time and with ros be phase out and cfds come in that will have dramatic effect at the moment the gas price cover something like more than half the generation and that will fall to much low figure can give my hon friend the actual figure my hon friend first point about constraint payment be worth dwell on if we be worried about constraint payment because the network be not there we be right to be worried but if that be our view we should support the building of the network infrastructure across the country we can not have it both way we can not say that we be worried about constraint payment and the cost on consumer but that we can not have the new infrastructure build that be an issue and it be choice would not call it dilemma exactly that every member across the house have to make uk household and business pay almost the high energy cost compare with other european country as have already be say many time although it be worth repeat that be because the cost of electricity be couple to the cost of gas absolutely share the secretary of state ambition to rapidly reduce our reliance on gas long medium and short duration storage will play vital role in bridge the intermittency of renewable what more can the government do to rapidly increase support for these emerge technology ldes as it be know to the super nerd long duration energy storage be really important as indeed be battery we now have cap and floor mechanism for ldes ofgem along with neso be look at the application that have be make and that will now be drive forward that be really important what always say to people be that we need all the element of the system we need nuclear in my view we need renewable we need battery storage and we also need ldes all of they can contribute to clean power system thank the secretary of state for his statement it be clear that zonal pricing would not only waste valuable time in the race to reduce our reliance on costly fossil fuel it would see my constituent in ealing southall many of whom be on very low income and indeed family across london pay more for their bill do he agree that this labour government plan to invest in clean cheap renewable energy and to reform energy pricing for the whole country as one be fair and more effective way of reduce bill for everyone thank my hon friend for that really important question she make two point that be critical one be the time it would take to get to zonal pricing system and the second be the arbitrary nature of who would benefit and how and the cost differential think we can see that there would be great sense of unfairness about that she be also absolutely right that the choice be not reform or no reform the choice be what kind of reform that be what reform national pricing be all about above all my hon friend the member for northampton south mike reader refer to this this be about get on with it it might be lose in the mist of time but the conservative use to have target for clean power it be for clean power by but they never really talk about it much and then they sort of abandon it quietly the truth be that they use to understand this we have get to build the infrastructure and the renewable power generation the strategic spatial energy plan must ensure that new large energy project in wales work with and not against community there must also be role for local small scale project as these can deliver the large amount of clean energy we need with far less impact on our community and the national grid can the secretary of state say how the upcoming ssep will put the need of community at its heart and how it will support the expansion of small scale energy project the hon lady make really important point if may say so about the ssep and more broadly about the role of community energy and for example rooftop solar even before we introduce the future home standard we be see an increase in the number of new home with solar panel on their roof we have get community energy which be much more successful in place such as germany and denmark which gb energy will be power forward also be really interested in how we make it more worthwhile for individual householder to install solar panel it be right for they and it be way to cut bill that be what be really exciting about it we definitely see small scale and community energy not just as part of our planning for the future but as something we want to drive forward warmly welcome my right hon friend decision today zonal pricing sound like good idea but the reality be that the uncertainty about future arrangement be risk investment and would not lead to job in green manufacturing in my constituency of edinburgh north and leith or indeed across scotland to meet the need of consumer and business we need more flexible energy network so can he set out in more detail how he envisage that happen thank my hon friend for that really important question the impact on scotland be an important dimension here because scotland have really exciting plan to drive forward renewable energy particularly offshore wind it can be massive job creator for the future and it be something we be really focused on one other issue with zonal pricing be that fear it would have have quite an adverse effect on the scottish green economy which be point powerfully make by lot of different stakeholder can definitely say to my hon friend that we be committed we think that scotland have rightful place as an energy capital and an energy powerhouse and offshore wind be crucial part of that thank you for allow my question madam deputy speaker must apologise to the house and the front bench for be little late appreciate the high wire nature of the act that the secretary of state and his ministerial team be try to deliver but there be two litmus test in scotland that be absolutely crucial first private investment be essential to make the journey to net zero happen secondly scotland be such an energy rich country as he reference and yet we be pay the high price for tariff and standing charge will his statement make it easy for private investment to come in and deliver we towards that journey to net zero and do he foresee low energy cost for consumer in scotland the answer to both those question be yes the first point the hon member raise be important and go to the question ask by my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert which be on the fear that lot of people have that it would dry up the renewable industry in scotland if we go down the route of zonal pricing that be why we have opt for the reform national pricing system that we have talk about to elaborate on the second point build this clean power system that can lower wholesale price which be the absolute prize here be the route to lower energy cost for people in scotland and across the uk last summer be the hot on record and this summer may be even hot still the world face climate crisis to tackle that we need to move fast to net zero and scotland energy sector will be crucial in this country achieve that to do that we need to encourage not discourage investment and we can not waste any time do the secretary of state think the decision will help scotland boost its energy sector and through that this country fight against climate change my hon friend speak with great expertise and passion on these issue on his first point it be worth say something about this and hope to say more on it in the next week or so the impact of climate change that we be see around the world be the new normal be afraid but they be not normal in comparison with the past we be see some horrifying scene around the world and the warming of the planet make they much more likely to happen so there be real urgency and he be right to emphasise that he be also absolutely right that scotland will play pivotal role for the uk in answer the question on energy security and tackle the climate crisis believe the announcement today will help in that endeavour yesterday host roundtable of manufacturer in the rural part of my constituency they welcome the government industrial strategy and particularly the measure on industrial energy price but they raise concern about the grid connection in that part of my constituency will the government work with to improve these grid connection because the teesside region have thousand of job in clean energy and green industry and want all my industry to benefit from that the energy minister have just volunteer unprompte which rarely happen in this house to meet my hon friend so enthusiastic be he about discuss this issue my hon friend be right to raise the issue of grid connection we inherit an absolutely break system that be massively oversubscribed with zombie queue lengthen delay and nothing happen basically that be why we have end the first come first serve system and be do much more intentional plan system for the grid that be good for connect renewable energy but the other crucial thing be that by work out which energy project we need and which we do not we free up the queue for industrial project that be the key and that be the work that neso be currently embark upon hope that it will help business in his constituency and across the country to deal with the obvious and acknowledge frustration they have on grid connection thank the secretary of state for opt for reform system which will avoid bill go up in my constituency and provide the certainty to drive investment in our energy system do he agree that our clean power mission will be vital not only to generate low bill and well job for area such as mine but to provide future and opportunity for people grow up in the area where new mona wind farm have just be approve my hon friend put it so well when talk to young people who be think about the job they might do in the future from nuclear to renewable to carbon capture be always strike that across the board they know these be the growth industry of the future there be huge opportunity for britain include for her constituent and it be incredibly exciting what we can deliver this be the new case for climate action it be about energy security low bill job and growth and do the right thing for future generation thank my right hon friend for his statement and for his vision on inherit zombie system from the previous government do he agree that it be remarkable that the conservatives have show no contrition whatsoever about the dire state in which they leave our energy system that result in the bad cost of living crisis in memory and family in ilford south and across the country be still pay the price my hon friend put it incredibly well the conservatives have show no contrition or acknowledgment and they have not learn any lesson not single one they basically say we be right and the electorate be wrong say to they gently or not so gently that that be recipe for oblivion frankly it be time they take long hard look thank my right hon friend for his statement want to put on the record my thank to the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks for the extensive conversation that he have have with and other welsh labour mp on our concern about zonal pricing and that we feel it would fail the fair and affordable test that the secretary of state have outline today so welcome this statement now that we have have this announcement about reform national pricing will he assure my constituent and business that they will see low consumer bill as result that be the key this decision provide the certainty require it be the fair choice it be the choice that will not lead to seven year of uncertainty risk premium and high bill it give we the platform to work with industry to get on and deliver if have one message for industry it be that now be the time for they to step up and come forward with these project we be break down all the barrier that they face for example on planning the grid and uncertainty our absolute determination be to get on and deliver for my hon friend constituent and people across the country energy planning energy security and net zero committee select committee statement we now come to the first of the select committee statement the chair of the committee will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement brief question not speech emphasise that question should be direct to the committee chair not to the minister front benchers may take part in questioning it give great pleasure to present our committee first report of this session gridlock or growth avoid energy planning chaos think it follow on very nicely from the statement we have just hear from the secretary of state for energy security and net zero especially give some of the question that follow thank my committee colleague for their diligence and proactive engagement throughout the inquiry which have enable we to produce detailed report in challenging timescale the secretary of state in his statement just now address some of the concern that we raise in our report about planning and the part it play in ensure that infrastructure be build as he say in the right place so that we can effectively provide power where it be require and at cost that be affordable for domestic and business consumer his focus on the serious problem of high energy price for business be very welcome the committee have take evidence on that most recently yesterday when the chemical industries association refer to crisis in the uk industry cause by uncompetitive energy price in our report we consider the role of the strategic spatial energy plan the secretary of state tell the house just now that it will be publish next year again we welcome that it be recommendation in our report but we want much great clarity on both how the clean power action plan and the ssep relate to grid connection and the development consent process we find evidence of significant confusion over the role that grid connection have in determine securing planning consent and similarly the role that have plan consent can play in secure grid connection be pleased to hear the secretary of state make his commitment to the publication of the ssep but encourage he to do so soon rather than later in the and the country make substantial investment in super grid secure and modern energy infrastructure design to meet the country grow energy need it be design to give we year of resilience in the the grid be already come under strain and be in need of continued investment so what do the government do they privatise it sir malcolm rifkind provide the rationale he say that the energy industry should be able to make its own investment decision base on its investment need and on the resource that it can raise in order to fund that investment official report december vol unshackle from the state our energy infrastructure be expect to attract its own investment but for our vital grid infrastructure the promise private funding just do not materialise at the time rise star of the labour party the then shadow energy secretary some people may have hear of he tony blair challenge the market lead approach to energy infrastructure he tell this house even when the industry be privately own abroad in most country major strategic decision be take by government not company official report december vol he go on to say all those unresolved contradiction underline the stupidity indeed the impossibility of an energy policy determine by the interest of the private sector the very consideration most critical to secure the long term future electrical supply be the very one least suit to the inevitable short term demand of the market official report december vol the then future prime minister prediction be sadly all too accurate today whether we pursue renewable nuclear or internationally trade gas the reality remain the same we urgently require overdue upgrade to our age energy network the strategic direction of this government be clear to build and deliver the energy infrastructure that will cut carbon emission secure our energy supply in the face of serious and grow international threat and reduce energy cost for household and business over the long term if we get that right the uk have the opportunity to become global leader not only in develop and deploy low carbon infrastructure but in how we manage the transition itself energy security be the top priority for this government as it be for my committee of course we want britain to stand on its own two foot produce energy on our land on our shore and in our sea and by our own worker give we the opportunity to seize back control of household bill political consent and public support for the energy transition be essential because britain national security depend on it the government have set ambitious target for the uk transition to clean energy underpin by both international commitment and domestic legal obligation but real progress will depend not on high level debate about ideology or party politic but on whether we can construct the low carbon generation and transmission infrastructure need to meet those goal in practice that be where the policy statement come in they provide essential planning guidance for local and national authority on how to evaluate propose energy infrastructure and how such proposal interact with wide strategy and land use plan we call our report gridlock or growth because the choice be stark if we get the transition right the uk can benefit from clean cheap renewable energy cut bill boost business and support the growth need to fund well healthcare education and pension but the current system for prioritise grid connection have become severely congested too many speculative project with little chance of be build be clog up the queue delay or block more viable one the system have effectively seize up one of our clear finding be the need for common sense reform the government be right to propose move away from purely market drive system because that system leave unchecked have lead directly to the current gridlock planning authority can not remain blind to project chance of secure grid connection project prospect of grid connection should become material consideration in the consent process it be sensible at this time to have guide hand prioritise those project most likely to deliver the energy generation we need and to build the necessary transmission infrastructure to get that energy to business and household across the country of course none of that will work without proper planning consent that in turn depend on meaningful engagement between developer and community engagement that happen early and be focus on resolve issue before they become entrenched that be key part of how we avoid the lengthy and expensive legal challenge that have hold the british energy sector back too often new solar or wind farm and the pylon need to carry energy to home and business become flashpoint of local opposition community be frequently consult too late to shape the outcome or not give real insight into the trade off involve we hear that when people be tell that underground or offshore option may cost more and lead to high bill they be often more open to overland option similarly the committee recommend that nature positive infrastructure project can engage and well galvanise public consent for development and that there should be presumption against build onshore wind infrastructure on deep peat the committee recommend that the national energy system operator should use strategic planning to foster early deep community engagement well before the formal consent stage and that the government require developer to engage early and meaningfully with local community to identify potential impact explore mitigation option and commit to deliver they we also hear that significant proportion of propose mitigation despite have funding allocate be never actually deliver the failure of the system to enforce the measure erode public trust in the process the result of poor consultation be that nobody be satisfied community feel ignore developer face avoidable delay and legal cost planner and court be burden unnecessarily and confidence in the system be undermine the principle be simple put the right project in place through direction from the centre secure consent and mitigation by build trust in the system early engagement and proper enforcement and build the infrastructure the clean power plan and soon please the ssep set the priority we have the investment and innovation potential support by the industrial strategy low bill great security and sustainability of energy supply be there for the taking let we take they and go from current gridlock to growth commend this statement to the house we have just hear how important it be that we get community support for infrastructure the committee support the presumption of consent for low carbon infrastructure with critical national priority status however the committee set out in the report serious concern about the potential impact on biodiversity and the lack of delivery on promise ecological mitigation do the hon gentleman agree that it be essential for parliament to hold the government to account on ensure that the energy transition be deliver in genuinely nature positive way thank the hon lady for her question and for her service on the committee her contribution be always valuable in our discussion and in the question we put to our witness she rightly raise nature mitigation which we look at in our inquiry as mention in my statement we hear that all too often developer do not implement the mitigation that they be require to make it be very important this be one of our recommendation to government as she imply to ensure that developer carry out their obligation and implement the improvement that she refer to thank the chair of the select committee for lead we through the report it be right that sometimes select committees pose more of challenge to government in this case think it be right to call out that while the department be do great thing and work at pace we need to ensure that everything be join up and co ordinate the national policy statement the land use framework the new ssep strategy and plan need to be join up to ensure that nature positive and nature base solution and environmental protection be also join up do the chair agree with that the department need to worker hard to ensure that while we deliver at pace everything give one coherent message to the market be also very grateful to my hon friend for his contribution he join the committee recently and have grab the agenda with both hand as one of our most assiduous attender think he and the hon member for bath wera hobhouse match each other on attendance actually do not want to give the wrong impression he be correct we need the government to engage with our recommendation on enforcement of nature positive solution he give an opportunity to reiterate that there be confusion on whether the need for plan consent precede grid connection or the other way around think we could do with the government clear up some of those thing we be all in favour of green energy in lincolnshire and we do our bit with massive wind turbine in the north sea but will the committee do more in depth report about the sheer concentration of solar farm in lincolnshire with acre around the town of gainsborough know that the grid connection be important but surely the committee could play useful role in say that all part of the country should do their bit we can not simply take acre out of good agricultural production in one small part of england that be something that we have look at as part of this inquiry and more widely it be really important that those who host major energy infrastructure be take on board we make recommendation about early engagement and about listen to rather than ignore what local community say about the potential for re rout site or route for pylon the right hon gentleman talk about solar farm but be there other option there be good evidence that when engagement be do in the correct way compromise be often possible although not everybody will ever be happy in consultation there be definitely well way for these thing to be do commend the committee and my hon friend for their work the report echo what national grid tell when visit its operation in hams hall in my constituency do he agree that the government work on the planning and infrastructure bill have pave the way for infrastructure project to be deliver more quickly and that business such as jaguar land rover whose battery assembly plant be in hams hall will welcome his committee work and the government effort on deliver vital infrastructure my hon friend make an excellent point there be good crossover between the planning and infrastructure bill go through parliament and the amendment make to the national policy statement our recommendation pick up some of the linkage between the two as she suggest the key point be how we speed up the process so that we can get to my final point which be to get on and build the infrastructure as she say the report highlight an ambiguity about what be say centrally by the government and what be expect from industry separately from this report the select committee have hear evidence on tidal range power generation from the severn and during visit about innovative approach do the chair of the select committee share my concern that the confusion cause by that ambiguity could lead to the uk miss out on opportunity to be world leader in alternative type of generation and do he agree the situation must be clarify be also grateful to the hon lady for her contribution since the start of the committee she be another assiduous attender she make absolutely the right point where we have identify area of ambiguity there be many around grid connection and planning which have touch on before the government need to clear they up so that decision can be make in timely fashion developer can have the confidence and certainty that they need and we can get on with the process of improve the infrastructure the grid capacity connection and the supply of cheap clean energy thank the chair of the select committee for his incredibly thorough and interesting report which look forward to read will he comment on an amendment that table to the planning and infrastructure bill it be often say that suffolk coastal may be host up to of the uk future energy or transport that future energy we have four nationally significant infrastructure project within five mile radius and there have be no co ordination between the energy developer for the planning and development of those project my amendment would have legally require such co ordination when energy developer bring forward their plan so that we can manage mitigation look at the issue and well plan and develop out when large nsips be be develop it be important that we have proper co ordination between developer and different project which we also touch on in our report the national policy statement be the strategically important element of planning so it be very much relevant to my hon friend point think she will find that some of the comment and evidence that we hear in our inquiry lend themselves to the point she just make there be plan for major solar farm substation and other infrastructure in north west norfolk and across the county take high quality agricultural land out of use the cumulative impact of that be be ignore welcome the committee recommendation on solar do the hon gentleman agree that the planning system should ensure that energy infrastructure be build on develop land brownfield land and industrial land not on good quality agricultural land why do he think that the government have so far fail to prioritise energy security in the national policy statement think most of that question be probably well answer by ministers but as to what we find in our evidence it be very much the case that we have to work with local community to address their concern about have to host significant amount of infrastructure as in the hon gentleman community the point about put solar or wind farm on brownfield land be good one do not think anybody be against that and think that that be part of what the government intend the point be that there be occasion when that be not possible but the key be to engage with people and take they with we by demonstrate the case for where infrastructure must go child social care education committee select committee statement we come now to the second select committee statement helen hayes will speak for up to minute during which time no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement there should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not the relevant minister front benchers may take part in questioning be grateful to the backbench business committee for allocate time for this statement today speak on behalf of the education committee and more importantly the thousand of child across england whose life be profoundly shape by our child social care system put on record my thank to the committee clerks and specialist who have support this inquiry as well as to georgia jake lamar and louise the four young adult with recent experience of the care system who come to give oral evidence to the committee in person know that it be not easy to speak about the challenge that they have face include experience that no child should ever have to endure but by do so they have help to shape our report and ensure that young people have be at the centre of our thinking we be very grateful child social care provide essential support to some of our most vulnerable young people child who have face trauma neglect abuse bereavement or instability they need not only protection but love stability and the opportunity to thrive in december our predecessor committee launch an inquiry into the state of child social care follow the general election my committee resolve to continue that critical work our inquiry build on substantial evidence include the independent review of child social care publish in which conclude that the system be fail to meet child need the evidence we have receive from care experienced young people social worker local authority charity and academic confirm that many of these challenge persist the system be under significant strain rise need stretch budget and workforce shortage be compromise the ability to put child genuinely at the heart of the system we have see significant shift in the profile of spending on child social care from spend on early help service which have fall in real term over the last decade to spend on costly crisis intervention which have rocket this imbalance be unsustainable the independent review propose billion uplift in child social care spending between and with billion annually ringfence for family help service to shift focus toward early intervention that recommendation have not be fully implement there have be rise need for child social care over the past decade with the number of look after child stand at almost in an increase of over since these pressure reflect broad social and economic challenge poverty be key driver of social care involvement and the forthcoming child poverty strategy must be ambitious aim to significantly reduce the number of child grow up in financial hardship we urge the government to allocate substantial portion of new funding from the spending review to restore early intervention service to level in real term prevention be not only the right thing to do by child and their family it be also more cost effective the shortage of appropriate placement for look after child be critical issue in of look after child be place outside their local authority and be place more than mile from home disrupt education and relationship and exacerbate trauma we call on the department for education to publish national sufficiency strategy for child social care require every local authority to develop plan to reduce out of area placement and demonstrate how they be implement good practice not every local authority send child far away from home and we believe more can be do to reduce this harmful practice the child social care market be fail to deliver for child and local authority the excessive profit of some provider be unacceptable and report of financial instability among some large operator be deeply concern the children wellbeing and schools bill include provision to reform this market which we welcome however these measure must be rigorously monitor the department should provide annual update to parliament on their impact and if profit cap be introduce my committee must be consult on draft regulation our inquiry examine all form of child social care foster care adoption kinship care residential care and support for disabled child within foster care the most common placement type there be shortage of approximately carer we urge the department to develop national foster strategy simply continue to advertise for more foster carer will not be sufficient and work be need to address some of the practical barrier that prevent foster carer from be able to sign up once they show an interest in do so in particular we be call for collaboration with the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that housing policy properly support foster carer recruitment kinship care be vital option for many child the forthcoming kinship allowance pilot must provide financial support equivalent to that of foster carer and we call for legislation to guarantee kinship leave entitlement for adopted child the adoption and special guardianship support fund must be make permanent to eliminate annual funding uncertainty while we support the emphasis on kinship and foster care high quality residential care remain essential for some child report of child place in unsuitable setting such as caravan and boat be completely unacceptable the opposite of child centre approach the new regulation and inspection regime for supported accommodation be positive step but universal care standard must apply across all placement the social care workforce be in crisis with high turnover and overstretch staff increase safeguard risk we call for comprehensive workforce strategy to improve retention and reduce reliance on agency staff which increase by over the five year to disabled child face significant barrier include limited access to respite care and inconsistent assessment we hear that support for disabled child be often deprioritise as social service focus on child protection concern and that sometimes parent of disabled child be treat with suspicion and subject to inappropriate assessment without justification when they need support we urge the department to implement the law commission proposal and establish clear national eligibility criterion mental health support be another critical gap child in care be four time more likely to experience mental health challenge yet access to service remain inadequate we recommend pilot co locate mental health service between social care and child and adolescent mental health service and strengthen mental health assessment for child in care it be essential that child in care have voice when important decision be be make about their life currently too few child be access the advocacy support they be entitle to with an average referral rate of just across local authority we endorse the independent review proposal for an opt out model of independent advocacy for all child in care to ensure their voice be hear reunification with birth family when safe and appropriate can be positive outcome for child and parent however current practice be inconsistent the department must evaluate reunification practice and publish national guidance to ensure it be prioritise when suitable and in the good interest of the child there be child on child protection plan in an increase of from neglect remain significant concern and we call for national survey on the prevalence of abuse and neglect and dedicated national neglect strategy finally and most concerningly support for young people when they leave care be simply not good enough care leaver have some of the poor outcome in society across range of measure of care leaver aged to be not in education training or employment compare with of all young people in that age group and it be estimate that quarter of homeless people have be in care care leaver still face cliff edge in support on turn we hear from young people who have to drop level and struggle to afford rent while in full time education at the age of just the department for education must develop national care offer to ensure minimum standard of support across the country and review and improve the financial and housing support available to care leaver our child deserve compassionate coherent and effective social care system that place their need at the centre behind every statistic be child who deserve the same opportunity as their peer to feel safe love and empower to thrive the recommendation in my committee report provide road map for reform we urge the government to act swiftly in address rise need restore early intervention reform the delivery of care placement ensure well mental health service support the workforce and stop care leaver face cliff edge at the age of we owe it to these child to build system that be not merely reactive but restorative not just efficient but compassionate and not only functional but transformational congratulate the chair of the select committee on this report and thank she and the committee for their work on it particularly welcome the recommendation on kinship care which mirror closely the measure in the ten minute rule bill that introduce in this place three year ago and which we on the liberal democrat benches have be campaign on hope she will work cross party to make sure the government go far and fast on kinship care want to pick up on the committee recommendation on the adoption and special guardianship support fund she and know how distressed the family of child who have be adopt or put into kinship care who need this support be it be very small amount of money do she agree that if the fund could be expand slightly all child could go back to have the level of support they have before the cut be introduce few month ago thank the hon member for her question and for all her interest and work in this important area the report make strong recommendation for the government to make the adoption and special guardianship support fund permanent to evaluate the impact of the cut in the short term and to review and make change to the level of funding if necessary we know that the government be look at change and improvement particularly in access to mental health service so that more child who be adopt can get support through mainstream health service without have to rely on specialist funding as supplement for that we think the government should look carefully at how that go but not be hesitant to restore the fund if that be need follow monitoring be pleased to have contribute to this report as member of the education committee which be excellently lead by my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes also thank the clerks and staff for all their work on the committee it be good that the report have be welcome by the centre for young life the county councils network as well as care leaver charity such as become will my hon friend expand on the section of the report about keep child safe evidence that we hear from our witness during the inquiry suggest that the children wellbeing and schools bill be go to do lot to address their concern about keep child in care safe despite that we have still make recommendation about multi agency work we have recommend that those agency have clear process in place so that they can review and escalate concern between different agency with clear line of accountability and decision making to keep child safe and stop they fall through the gap do my hon friend agree that it should be priority for the department to get those process in place to prevent those child from fall through the gap thank my hon friend for his question and his contribution to the committee report he be right he will recall the distressing evidence that we take which come in the short aftermath of the verdict in the case of sara sharif who be so badly let down by service that have multiple opportunity to intervene and keep she safe but fail to do so we welcome the step that the government be take through the children wellbeing and schools bill to strengthen joint working particularly through the single child identifi and other measure around multi agency working practice we be call for the government to go far though because none of we can tolerate see any more of those tragic case in the headline the name of child who we remember and who be fail by service that should be there to protect they be immensely grateful to the chair of the education committee for the way she have introduce the report and the work she have do be particularly move by what she say about disabled people and wonder if she would look at the relationship between that and special need education as there be close association between the two will she also look at the issue of the quality of parenting be at school in my constituency just week ago and be tell that child be present to school really very poorly parent as that be relate to the subject that the hon lady have study it be not all child of course but too many be suffer in that way thank the right hon gentleman for his question and his interest in this area of work my committee be look separately at the issue of special educational need and disability and we expect to report shortly on that it be an expansive and lengthy inquiry he be of course right to say that there be some overlap in relation to child social care we hear from family with disabled child about the multiple difficulty they face with different part of system that be not join up enough to support they his question about parenting speak directly to our recommendation about the need to shift to early intervention and help and support in that vein welcome the government announcement this week about best start family hub and the expansion of those service which believe be try to do exactly that we will keep close watch on how that go over the come month thank my hon friend for her statement like she pay tribute to the care leaver who speak to we often share deeply traumatic story of their journey through the care system their corporate parent be ultimately the state and we as its custodian must bear the responsibility of ensure that we support child in care as if they be our own do my hon friend agree that that be why the committee recommendation that the government should implement national care leaver offer be so important and that do so would guarantee consistent approach across local authority thank my hon friend for her question and for her contribution to the report draw on her deep experience in this sector prior to come to this place many of we come to this subject area also as parent be the parent of year old and year old and find the story that the committee hear of child cut adrift by service at the age of when young people be still grow into adulthood and need so much help and support heartbreaking and unacceptable we be call for national care offer so that wherever care leaver be in the country they know there be guarantee level of support to help they into the next stage of life very much welcome the report which look forward to read in detail thank the committee for all its work on this important matter and of course the chair for introduce its many excellent recommendation so comprehensively there be lot to go on but wish quickly to touch on two point declare an interest as foster carer and adoptive parent and fully endorse the report which highlight the huge widen gap in foster care provision the emotional appeal for foster carer be powerful but as the committee say it simply be not enough do the chair agree that properly recognise the effort and complexity involve in foster placement be urgently need most importantly for child in care on support for care leaver have hear from too many who on reach or even before then move out of the council area where they be take into care so also endorse the call for national care leaver offer thank my hon friend for his question and for bring his personal experience to the debate agree with he about foster carer we look in detail at the issue and the gap between the number of people express an interest in foster care compare with those who sign up and become foster carer be enormous we focus our attention on some of the practical barrier that prevent people from become foster parent especially housing that be particularly the case for foster carer who might be live in social housing housing policy do not adequately support people who might want to come forward but do not have enough space at home when that be often the responsibility of the same local authority that be their landlord we think that more could be do to overcome the practical barrier that foster carer face point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker you will not know this but have learn that independent expert have advise that lincolnshire police be now at real risk of have to issue section notice the equivalent of public body declare that it can no long balance its budget it come after long campaign run my myself and colleague about lincolnshire police funding more generally have the home secretary advise you on whether she intend to come to the house to address that for the people of lincolnshire be acutely worried that police service in our county will cease to protect they from the risk and reality of crime and disorder thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order the chair have have no notice that the government intend to make statement but be sure that those on the government benches will have hear his comment which be now on the record on point of order madam deputy speaker support my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes but want to make different point of order have the government tell you that they will come to the house today to make statement on channel crossing the channel be in chaos today already people have pour across and arrive on june president macron and the prime minister say that this can not go on this be an existential crisis for our country and we want action just take in swap of week be not go to solve the problem on this vital issue have the government come to you madam deputy speaker and say that they want to make statement today thank the right hon member for give notice of his point of order confirm that the chair have have no notice from the government that they intend to make such statement today but those on the government front bench will have hear his interest in the matter bill present english devolution and community empowerment bill presentation and first reading standing order no secretary angela rayner support by the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer pat mcfadden secretary wes streeting secretary bridget phillipson secretary liz kendall and secretary heidi alexander present bill to make provision about combined authority combine county authority the greater london authority local council police and crime commissioner and fire and rescue authority local audit and term in business tenancy about rent bill read the first time to be read second time tomorrow and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en backbench business educational attainment of boys beg to move that this house have consider the attainment and engagement of boy in education thank the backbench business committee for grant the debate and thank colleague from across the house for their interest in what believe be one of the most overlooked and consequential challenge of our time the underachievement of boy at every stage of education this debate be not about grievance it be about evidence hope that today we can focus on the datum the consequence and the thing that must change to do well by our boy not instead of girl but alongside they be proud to have cian and alex work experience student from my constituency of bishop auckland with we in the gallery this afternoon work alongside my parliamentary assistant they have help to prepare for today debate with thoughtfulness curiosity and maturity hope that their presence be reminder of the promise that exist in young man in county durham and beyond we can not ignore the reality that too many of our boy be be leave behind by system that do not fully see they expect much from they or equip they with the tool to thrive let we start with the fact by key stage only of boy meet expect standard in reading writing and math which be seven percentage point behind girl when look at the writing gap alone boy be percentage point behind girl in their gcse exam boy on average achieve half grade low than girl across every subject at level girl outperform boy by an average of over grade and half across their good three subject and girl be even pull ahead in the new level qualification just of year old boy go into high education last year compare with of girl boy make up over of permanent school exclusion and of young people in custody eight out of nine man in prison report that they be exclude from school be secondary school teacher before enter parliament and the attainment gap be big worry but my big worry be that we do not respond properly to or cater for people who be neurodiverse about of our young people include girl be different learner but our curriculum do not really cater for they do the hon gentleman share my concern do share that concern we should have debate about the way in which we address that issue as well as about the issue face young care leaver the hon lady make an excellent point about what the prison population look like the issue be not just about adolescent because the problem begin in early year by the end of reception just of boy be assess to be school ready compare with of girl point that will return to later where do it end quarter of million young man age to be class as neet not in education employment or training which be high than the number for young woman that be post covid increase of for young male compare with an increase of just for young female what be more as the centre for social justice report recently for those young man who be in work the gender pay gap have be reverse young man be now out earn by their female peer include among the university educate this national challenge be especially acute in constituency like mine of bishop auckland and across former coalfield community in the north east where too often work class boy start behind and stay behind do not call the debate today merely to highlight an issue want it to lead to action and be call for real change that begin with take the issue seriously because what concern most be not the data but the absence of outrage and lack of urgency it be not always this way in the and it be girl who be lag behind the government rightly take action to improve outcome for girl introduce targeted support challenge curriculum bias expand grammar school for girl and promote girl access to science technology engineering and mathematic those be not small tweak but deliberate strategic intervention and they work now that the situation be reverse with boy persistently underachieving where be the strategy be not talk about general strategy to address deprivation or educational disadvantage but specific evidence base deliverable strategy around boy and young man that address the gender base aspect of underachievement at the foundation of that strategy must be resolve to stop blame boy and to start rebuild their self worth there be time in the when society do the same for girl it become know as the deficit approach because it attribute girl underachievement relative to boy to lack of effort or deficiency in they rather than the failure and limitation of the education system or prevalent socioeconomic trend so call biological determinist argue that gender difference be natural and unalterable and simply put girl be not as bright thankfully those nonsense theory have be well and truly debunk when it come to girl yet too often when we talk about boy the tone shift to blame it be as if boy underachievement be see as self inflict product of laziness or of so call toxic masculinity congratulate my hon friend on secure this incredibly important debate in my eight and half year as math teacher teach in inner city school find that the problem be never just about lack of aspiration but about lack of access and lack of knowledge that go for any group not just for boy do he agree absolutely that be point well make and hope that we will have more contribution of that nature during the debate boy be not the problem it be the system that be fail they of course we need to help boy to develop empathy respect for those who be different self control and awareness about how their word and action affect other but can we please be more careful not to tell boy that they be by nature toxic or that in they be privileged simply by be male when many feel anything but that they feel undervalue distrust and anxious that they will never live up to society expectation have not intend to contribute to this debate but the hon gentleman have provoke to do so by the character of his insight it be brave and right of he to deconstruct the nonsense about toxic masculinity and to emphasise that white working class boy of the kind that be prevalent in his constituency be particularly disadvantage by system that have underestimate indeed neglect their need he mention neet as an education minister do my good to address that issue but successive government have do insufficient congratulate he on bring this debate and on what he have say in it thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention and hope he will continue to contribute to the debate boy feel undervalued distrust and anxious that they will not live up to society expectation sam fender an icon of the north east recently put it we be very good at talk about privilege white male or straight privilege we rarely talk about class though and that lot of the reason that all the young lad be seduce by demagogue like andrew tate they be sham all the time and make to feel like they problem it this narrative be tell to white boy from nowhere town people preach to some kid in pit town in durham who get nothing and tell he he privileged then tate tell he he worth something it seductive we can not leave that space to be fill by online influencer sell toxic answer we have to offer something well belong purpose and hope evidence show that boy thrive when rather than be treat as problem they be trust within culture of high expectation when we set they up to succeed and when they know that their learning be relevant and will take they somewhere the coded message in our current curriculum be that society value academic excellence over development of technical skill and know how it be as if we have replace the plus with plus exam where those who get good gcse result go on to sit level which be give high esteem and those who fail be push towards vocational course as though those skill be less good example of school that be buck that trend which be attend by some of the young people from my constituency be the university technical college south durham in newton aycliffe which ofsted recently rat as one of the happy school in the country have meet some of its student they all have familiar story about how they be previously suspend and in trouble all the time at school but when they attend the utc they find purpose they build relationship promote leadership and make child feel known and that work the child be thrive boy include elsewhere school work with the yes he can programme or apply the take boys seriously framework from ulster university be close gap and rebuild trust with disengaged boy not coddle but understand they look up to see where the hon member for strangford jim shannon be when mention ulster and he be not in his place other example be hays travel and nissan which will take young people from the age of to give they vocational work experience welcome the government industrial strategy it be really exciting that for the first time in long time we be see real effort to create meaningful career pathway into the sort of secure job that young people in the north east use to be able to aspire to another good example be the plan to build million home we know that we can not do that unless we have more skilled young people come into those profession last week spend half day with some young apprentice from bishop auckland college bricklaying with gleeson homes in my constituency it be fabulous to see these young man who really have sense of direction they know that in few year time they would be earn good salary and able to build good family life my hon friend be give truly insightful and much need speech on this important matter will he join in recognise the importance of pre apprenticeship work for young boy who be not yet ready to take on apprenticeship as well as the value of some of the voluntary organisation such as mpower in st blazey in my constituency one hundred per cent that be another good example of why we need to create those pathway let say that be not call for we to stop encourage young man to go to university be working class lad and be much well suited to go the academic route than be to work as mechanic or something as those who have see put up shelf will attest be call for great parity of esteem respect for all skill and early opportunity for people to feel value as my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay noah law just point out will praise the hon gentleman again he be absolutely right about really value practical learning come from similar background to he be not clever enough to be practical so have to become an academic re establish the idea that vocational practical accomplishment have at least equal prowess to academic learning think it have great prowess actually be fundamental may add one other example with your indulgence madam deputy speaker the hon gentleman will know of the men sheds movement which be typically for old man visit the man shed in long sutton of which be president and there be youth shed bring young people into male community allow boy to share learn and grow what great example thank the right hon gentleman for that will speed through the rest of my speech because be conscious of time and the contribution of other people we want young boy to go to university too declare an interest use to tutor for the brilliant club in school in the north east that be about young people whose parent may not have go to university and help they to have that aspiration and realise what they could do on early year as say at the beginning lot of attainment be set before the age of five we know that even by the age of five boy be behind girl this government be do some significant thing that be important in that regard include the best start family hub which be announce just this week those be about not just child but parent be able to access support as parent myself know that raise my seven year old son much well than raise my year old son because make so many mistake in know how to help he too often try to use carrot and stick approach and do not understand well enough how to help he to reflect on his behaviour although they be both wonderful boy the free breakfast club initiative be about so much more than just breakfast recently visit cockfield primary school in my constituency where since it be an early adopter of the scheme attendance go from about or child to child every morning meet child who use to have difficulty be on time or who be regularly absent and be tell how they be now come and thriving wise headteacher there be use that scheme not just to feed the child but to engage they in meaningful activity that help develop their social and emotional skill before be elect be governor at benfieldside primary school in county durham where we introduce specialist social and emotional learning programme that be about help child to develop so call century skill such as emotional self regulation recognise what they be feel self awareness social awareness empathy and how to build healthy relationship the teacher report remarkable difference within year of the programme introduction and parent be come in and say something be happen to my child because they be so much calm and well able to manage their behaviour there be real opportunity for we to grasp this issue in the breakfast club in free school meal provision and in the best start family hub this be about not just increase funding but content if have one ask of the minister today it be to give minute of her time either by herself or with official to meet with and people use to work with in this field who have develop these really useful tool that can be introduce in any classroom setting believe we urgently need national strategy for boy attainment that be cross party evidence base and root in fairness it should invest in teacher training that recognise gender bias and engage boy more effectively it should embed social and emotional learning throughout the curriculum especially in early year and transition stage it should expand vocational and technical pathway recognise different route to success it should promote leadership opportunity for boy in school life and most importantly ensure transparent gender disaggregate datum to hold ourselves accountable nationally and locally this be debate not just about attainment but about dignity it be about who we see and who we invest in do not want boy in bishop auckland bootle barry or basingstoke to feel that the system have no place for they want they to feel see support and believe in because when we raise the floor for those who be struggle we lift the whole classroom let we act with some of the clarity and courage we show generation ago for girl our boy and our society deserve nothing less call the chair of the education committee congratulate my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on secure this debate and on his excellent speech as the chair of the education committee want to see every child and young person engage in learn throughout their time in education and help to find their individual interest and passion whether they be academic vocational or mix of both and to have build strong foundation on which they can thrive beyond their time in education and into adulthood in their work my committee and its predecessor committee have hear about the many and varied difference between group of child and young people and the need to do more to close those gap in participation and attainment our immediate predecessor committee launch an inquiry on the topic of the educational attainment of boy but the calling of the snap general election last summer mean that the committee never meet to discuss the evidence receive from stakeholder have draw on that evidence in prepare for this debate the association of school and college leaders be clear that it be important not to generalise about boy educational engagement and attainment many boy achieve well in education demonstrate good engagement and achieve qualification that allow they to move on to the next stage of their education or into an apprenticeship or their first job however there be particular group of boy who perform less well than similar group of girl dig into and understand this detail be an important part of address those disparity be fascinate by what be hear today meet tony bury my bath constituent who be work with the centre for social justice on improve outcome for boy encourage everybody who be interested in this issue to read its late report lost boys do the hon member agree that we need national strategy to address the underachievement of some boy thank the hon member for her intervention to reflect on what my hon friend the member for bishop auckland have say believe there be need for strategic approach to this issue but as will talk about later my committee be look at inclusive education and how we can make change in the system that help school to respond in more define way to the need of individual child believe that through some of those technique we can create an education system that work for everybody in particular when we think about the group of boy who do not thrive so well in education we know that white british boy black caribbean boy and mixed white and black caribbean boy eligible for free school meal have particularly low level of attainment as do those from gypsy or roma background or travellers of irish heritage difference between girl and boy emerge in the early year and pre school phase and continue right through to high education there be difference in speech and oral language development between boy and girl from the early year which be reflect in gender gap in phonic performance in year with the exception of math girl outperform boy at key stage and particularly in reading and writing at the end of reception year age around five three quarter of girl have good level of development while less than two third of boy do at key stage girl outperform boy on all of the headline department for education measure some of girl in state fund school achieve both english and maths gcse at grade or above which be high than the rate for boy progression to high education at the age of be high for young woman than it be for young man and among those who do take up place at university young man have high rate of drop out than young woman however despite enter the workforce with low qualification than woman on average man still earn more on average with the gender pay gap grow over time as such this be an area of policy that require complex and nuanced consideration be the difference between girl and boy attainment due to continue improvement over many year in the attainment and engagement of girl challenge for specific group of boy or mixture of both and what can and should be do to address those disparity the evidence that the select committee have receive reveal different view on what step should be take to address these persistent difference throughout school and university one viewpoint be that take step to improve engagement and attainment for every pupil will naturally help improve the engagement and attainment of those group of boy demonstrate the big gender gap the oecd report gender education and skills the persistence of gender gaps in education and skills publish in state that gender disparity in school performance and the resultant career choice do not stem from innate difference in aptitude but rather from student attitude towards learn and their behaviour in school from how they choose to spend their leisure time and from the confidence they have or do not have in their ability as student read ability be key cornerstone of many other aspect of education and the seemingly continual decrease in the proportion of boy read for pleasure over the year be one important issue to tackle commend booktrust on the work it be do with child laureate frank cottrell boyce to promote the importance and the joy of reading for pleasure and to encourage and support more child to find their love of book we know that screentime and the use of smartphone be have profound impact on child and young people from an increasingly young age among the many harm that child be expose to as consequence of their engagement online teacher parent and young people themselves report exposure to toxic masculinity we also know that excessive screentime harm young people sleep reduce their attention span and affect their ability to concentrate these be complex and difficult area but be clear that urgent action be need to protect child from online harm and that take step to promote positive role model and challenge unacceptable monoculture on social medium should be priority there be also big difference in the proportion of male and female teacher particularly in primary school it be important that we continue to support and encourage more man to teach young child evidence to the select committee suggest that quarter of all state fund primary school do not have single male classroom teacher it be clearly important that we have woman role model to encourage participation and engagement among girl particularly in stem subject but the same apply to boy see male teacher in the classroom and in other educational role such as learn support assistant there be difference between boy and girl in the presentation and diagnosis of special educational need and disability and our work on the education select committee be clear about both the failure of the current send system describe as lose lose lose by the last conservative secretary of state for education and the need to drive early identification of need instead of allow child to go unsupported in education education health and care plan be more than twice as prevalent for boy as for girl as of the beginning of this year of boy be identify with sen compare with of girl too many child struggle with dyslexia the delay for assess pupil with social emotional and mental health issue be unacceptable and adhd be significantly underdiagnose across the country my committee have be look in detail at send for several month now and we will shortly publish our report our work have include visit to number of school and college setting that be already deliver inclusive practice for send it seem clear that some of the technique that can be use to ensure that every child need be meet in school would also deliver benefit specifically for boy who be underachieving for example at aylsham high school in norfolk which we be pleased to visit just couple of week ago and at west credit secondary school in ontario we see vocational subject such as construction skill horticulture and food production on offer alongside academic subject in way that help to secure the interest and engagement of wide range of pupil we know that the previous government change to the curriculum have result in sharp decline in the availability of some creative subject and sport in our school we all appreciate the importance in education of people find the thing that they love to do and can succeed at which can sustain their motivation to participate in some aspect of education that be more challenging it be important that we have an education system that can deliver that for every child every member of this house will remember that special teacher who spark particular interest in field of study or passion for an area that particularly enthuse and engage we for it be my former headteacher tony richardson of ormskirk grammar school which confusingly be actually comprehensive school he be my english teacher and he teach about debating and literature and take close interest and it make huge difference tackle the recruitment and retention crisis in teaching and help teacher to commit to stay for the long term also allow child to have that special relationship with staff which be important this week my committee hear from professor becky francis who be lead the government curriculum and assessment review professor francis be clear on the importance and challenge of ensure that every pupil no matter their background can find themselves in the curriculum they be teach across wide range of subject whether it be careful tracking of pupil rich and varied curriculum exciting trip make every lesson engage make sure there be opportunity to secure content that might not have be fully grasp on the first attempt teacher whose enthusiasm and knowledge be match by their pedagogical skill improved teacher training time for continue professional development strong leadership from school leader or the improved engagement of parent and carer it will all help every child to achieve their full potential that include the group of boy who be underperform compare with their peer we must build an education system in which every child can thrive that require an honest acknowledgment of the area in which our system be currently fail include for some group of boy forensic understanding of the reason why and the courage to deliver reform that can make difference this be vitally important issue and it be one in which my committee will continue to maintain close interest rise order member will have notice that time be tick on and want to get as many people in as possible would therefore be grateful if member could limit their remark to around four minute start by thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth for secure this crucial debate the attainment and engagement of boy especially work class boy in their education will determine how society will look in the year and decade to come despite the importance of this topic however it have languish at the bottom of the list of national priority for far too long in my constituency of heywood and middleton north be proud of the contribution make by teacher who work hard to leave no child behind but until there be worthy intervention at national level to address the scale of the current crisis in the system over boy attainment they will be do so with one hand tie behind their back this issue and its driver have be misunderstood and misrepresent for far too long and be pleased to see mps today grapple with the topic in way that some have not but that be only half the battle historically only piecemeal policy proposal have be half heartedly explore proposal unfit even to nip at the heel of this challenge let alone address it in its entirety who must live with the consequence of that inertia it be the boy who have go to school this morning in my constituency and across the country they be less likely than girl in their class if current trend persist to seize the opportunity that school offer they boy and young man in community like mine be just as deserve of chance to get on in life and to fulfil their potential as their counterpart in more affluent area but they have be badly let down in the postcode lottery that have affect our society it be disadvantaged boy who be be hold back as my hon friend the member for bishop auckland point out early class be not dirty word and we must not shy away from it when talk about this issue in rochdale borough where my constituency sit there be gap between boy eligible for free school meal and those who be not when it come to who be meet the expect standard in reading writing and math at key stage that gap reverberate throughout boy entire academic career and it widen when they come to sit their gcse there be gap in the borough between boy who receive free school meal and those who do not when it come to the percentage of pupil get grade or above in english and math at the end of high school in both instance boy on free school meal which be welcome and wholly necessary intervention be underperform by comparison with those who be not it be not by slight amount it be significant there be crossover when it come to the issue at play here not just around gender but around socioeconomic circumstance one way of assess this more closely be by compare the rate of exclusion among boy from deprive area with the rate among girl and their male counterpart from more affluent background poor boy be twice as likely as their female peer to be permanently exclude and five time more likely than their more affluent male peer to be remove from school accord to the centre for social justice the gap be widen in some instance economic hardship can be contribute factor to exclusion and isolation which can obviously lead to multiple negative outcome school exclusion and low attendance be intimately link to crime with the prison reform trust recently highlight that of the prison population be regularly truant from school this be not party political issue because no party have monopoly on good idea in order to get this right across the whole country we must speak to those who even in the most try of circumstance be make inroad in support boy to succeed and thrive and we must enable institution to inform national policy rather than think that we know well welcome the step that the department for education have take recently but we must go even far although class be currently not protect characteristic it should be give similar level of parity believe that the government should be mandate to consider class when policy proposal relate to child education be be consider arbitrary and outdated measure of class lead to arbitrary and outdated policy outcome and we need to codify modern definition of class in order to hold government to account through this lens the clock be tick for the boy who go to school hungry this morning for those struggle to keep pace with their peer in their schoolwork for those cry out for teacher to recognise their individual need and to act and for those who stand on the brink of exclusion their future hang in the balance and we can no long neglect to ask the question that we may not like the answer to the challenge face boy in school be complex and the solution will take grit to implement but it be time to finally heed the warning that have be sound for decade and to find the courage that elude we in face up to these challenge in the past truly fear the consequence if we do not rise order there be an immediate three minute time limit thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth for secure this very important debate rise to speak on an issue that cut across every postcode every classroom and every community the persistent and grow gap in educational engagement and attainment among our boy although declare an interest by admit to the house that be the proud mum of two boy we must make it clear that this be not about pit one group of student against another it be about recognise that some of our boy particularly those from working class background and from the british caribbean community and boy with special educational need be be systematically leave behind by system that be never design with they in mind over the past decade nearly million five year old boy have start primary school already behind by the age of girl consistently outperform boy in read by around seven percentage point and in write by about six percentage point while the math gap sit at around five point by gcse level of girl achieve at least grade in english and math compare with just of boy these be not trivial difference they be measurable systemic and enduring among pupil eligible for free school meal the attainment gap fall across the same old fault line with just of white boy and of black caribbean boy achieve at least grade in english and math in croydon east have hear from teacher youth worker parent and student that our young people and those who support they know that they do not lack talent ambition or even motivation but opportunity we need curriculum that speak to they mentor that look like they and teacher who truly believe in they welcome this government commitment to break down barrier to opportunity to raise standard and to give all child the good start in life now be the time to consider how we invest in early intervention before exclusion and the school to prison pipeline take hold to look at how we expand male role model with male teacher but also with mentoring and youth outreach in the community and to change accountability system in school so that we be not punish creativity but have more inclusive approach to how people learn it be time for we to stop ask why boy be disengage and to start ask what we can do to change how we re engage they because every boy in croydon and all across britain deserve the right to learn thrive and dream thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth not just for secure this debate but for his excellent speech at the outset it be so good that he inspire the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes to cross the floor very briefly as the member for suffolk coastal have hear from parent teacher and community leader about their grow concern on this very topic of the educational outcome of boy particularly those from disadvantaged and rural background we have already hear lot about the datum and it be stark nationally boy be consistently underperform girl at every stage from early year through to gcse and beyond in just of boy meet the expect standard in reading writing and math at key stage compare with of girl and we know boy be less likely to achieve grade or above in english and math gcse the issue be about not just attainment but engagement boy be far more likely to be exclude and more likely to be label as disruptive they be less likely to enjoy school or feel that it meet their need that be especially true in rural area such as mine where transport funding and access to support service all create additional barrier in suffolk coastal we have see at first hand the effect of these systemic issue parent in leiston and felixstowe tell they be worried that their son be be write off far too early we know that child with complex need or send issue especially autism and adhd face even more barrier to get on in school with an overstretched educational system and ehcp delay for child battle send the barrier be continue to stack up we need to rethink how we engage boy not through blame or stereotype but through recognise diversity of need and learn style this mean early intervention with more speech and language support in the early year and the new best start family hub programme could be real game changer in place such as suffolk coastal by provide the right level of support we also need to have truly broad and balanced curriculum and parity of esteem for art and sport with vocational learning be at the heart of that we need to make sure that school be genuinely place for child and boy specifically to thrive not feel as though they be round peg be force into square hole in closing if we be serious about improve boy attainment we need system that support their potential and be build around they we need to back school family and community with the resource they need to close that gap this be not just for boy but for society as whole thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth for secure today debate as other have do start by say that the number be stark by almost every measure boy be fall behind by the end of primary school just of boy meet the expect standard in english and math compare with of girl for white working class boy from low income household that picture be even bleaker just of those eligible for free school meal meet that same benchmark at gcse thank my hon friend for his speech the educational attainment of boy be serious concern and agree with he that it be principally class issue working class boy be far behind in their gcse and face high neet rate and exclusion rate with low rate of those go on to he do my hon friend agree that to prevent crime and antisocial behaviour and to deal with wide economic issue we need to see early intervention and target support for working class boy my hon friend be absolutely right and will come on to many of the issue that he refer to he represent community with demographic that be similar in many way to my own so very much welcome his effort in this space in staffordshire as across the country boy be around more likely to be exclude than girl and twice as likely to be permanently exclude we have to work out why that be happen and why so many of our boy and young man feel out of place in the classroom and in school and subsequently rebel against the system as the first in my family to attend university know that our education system particularly after the incredibly damaging reform of certain former education secretary all too often feel like it be one size fit all that be particular barrier to opportunity for white working class boy who often do not see themselves reflect in school cannock chase sadly fall significantly behind the national average with just of receive high education qualification compare with nationally in of man from staffordshire have start in high education by the age of compare with of woman as man raise to be proud feminist the fact that the rate and number of woman go to university have increase hugely since first overtake those of man in the should absolutely be welcome it should not be see in any way as something that be take away from man as it be sometimes falsely characterise in recognise that however we must not ignore the fact that the rate and number of man go on to high education have rise much more slowly even more stark be the fact that of young people in cannock chase leave school with no qualification at all and only of white boy from staffordshire meet the expect standard in english reading and writing and math last year for young boy those be not just statistic they be social problem we must also recognise the danger of ignore grow crisis among boy when they feel alienated from school and opportunity other step in to fill that gap most worryingly that include the rise of toxic figure on social medium who spread misogyny young boy be be feed version of masculinity build not on resilience education and kindness but on dominance grievance and hatred as have be say if we shame man as whole or characterise all of they as privileged we not only fail to address this issue but push many boy towards those malign influence and risk lose generation to that toxicity welcome the fact that the government be work to address the root cause of violence against woman and girl in school teach pupil about healthy relationship and consent we need to draw boy into education by show they that it matter and that they matter we need to show they that they will play role in our society and that learning be not just for the academically gifted and the privileged we must invest in mentoring mental health and early intervention we must back apprenticeship technical pathway and as society value they as much as we do degree we must understand why so many man be walk away from education and training be it lack of support or financial pressure whatever the cause it deserve real scrutiny from this house and real solution we must also explore reform assessment method because not every young person thrive in system build around high stake exam coursework modular learning and vocational achievement must be value equally as they be when be at school above all as we have do today we must talk about this openly honestly and with urgency we have to inspire boy to stay and thrive in education and as my hon friend the member for bishop auckland so eloquently put it not shame they or make out that they have privilege when they have anything but instead we must guide they towards future define not by anger or exclusion but by achievement and respect congratulate my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on secure this important debate and pay credit to the work do by the young man in his office for too many year we have be sleepwalk into crisis of boy disengage and we have finally have the wake up call that we desperately need to show we that this house must do well from the tv show adolescence to gareth southgate lecture on the lack of male role model and the centre for social justice report on lost boys with its shocking revelation that two third of those who be unemployed be young man it be clear that everyone else can see this problem now it be time for we to tackle it stand as an mp because truly believe that this be the party that would break down the barrier to opportunity and it could not be clear that that mean tackle the issue of boy disengagement from education with only third of boy on free school meal achieve grade in both english and math it be time to ask why and to ask what this government should be do to break the glass ceiling for working class boy across the nation have champion the role of sport many time before in this place and will do it again today because we have mountain of datum that show that access to sport do matter for boy who struggle to get through the school day pe be often the only thing that keep they show up in the morning for boy who be on the edge of exclusion we have see that sport lead intervention can bring they back from the edge and improve their engagement with school and for boy look for community and sense of belong we know that too often they find that online in isolated community or in group commit act of antisocial behaviour the truth be that we be see the result of the conservative party decision to spend year starve neighbourhood of funding for community sport club local teacher from nicholas chamberlaine school in bedworth in my constituency tell that most child access physical activity only in school she tell that this be because the area be less privileged and so access to sport club safe outdoor space and even basic fitness opportunity outside school be limited that must change the evidence be clear sport lead intervention work they work when police force implement they they work when school use they and they work when local council implement they my ask today be clear fund sport lead intervention and fund they properly and give young people the sense of community and access to sport that they be cry out for before finish want to take moment to praise the many wonderful talented and kind young man and boy have meet include one of my volunteer who be one of the most dedicated and hard work people know the young man have meet in my constituency who be coach for their local club or who help out by volunteer and referee at local game and the young man who have join my team for work experience commend my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on secure this incredibly important debate we be here to talk about boy in education their engagement their outcome and their future the truth be that too many boy be fall behind in staffordshire just of boy achieve grade or above in english and math gcse last year that is percentage point down from the year before behind every percentage point be lad whose life chance be narrow they could be our future engineer our carer our bricklayer our paramedic or our entrepreneur full of potential but maybe start to think that school just be not for they that should worry we all what be clear be that it be not just about what happen in secondary school the sign be there so much early we know that boy be far less likely than girl to finish reception with good level of development that early gap often set the tone for the year ahead this be about far more than teaching it be about whether family can get into nursery whether health service be in place and whether parent feel support in the early year we can not fix educational inequality without look at the big picture that include child mental health family support and vitally investment in our town and village when place be leave behind the young people who live there be leave behind too and we know from the datum that it be particularly boy who be be leave behind be call on the government today to continue be bold to invest in the wraparound support that help child to thrive to expand mental health support in school and to strengthen the tie between school family and local service because when those link be strong child do well we know that intervention be find not only in education but in community my hon friend the member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor speak of the value of sport which be incredibly important in create opportunity the challenge of how to be man in century britain be brilliantly portray in the bafta win series big boys where young man grapple not only with the pressure of be work class at university but with the simple yet profound question of how to be both kind and masculine my hon friend the member for east thanet ms billington who be my good friend could not be here today but she have be do vital work champion the club which support working class university student and graduate be also proud member of that club she often reference the character of danny in big boys as an example and an inspiration it be powerful reminder that policy must meet young people where they be and lift they to where they deserve to be if we want fair more productive britain we can not keep write off young working class boy who be struggle to find their place in education we owe they well and know that the teacher school and wide community in stafford eccleshall and the village be ready to deliver when we give they the tool to do so today will speak about how boy from more deprived background have few academic and non academic skill and how it be harm their ability to get decent job in the post industrial era this topic be the subject of my second phd paper and although can not force member to read it can certainly force they all to listen today the puzzle that my paper address be why non graduate man be find it so hard to get job in the post industrial economy the employment rate for non graduate man have fall from about in the to about in the manufacture job that they use to do have disappear but if employment rate have rise as they have why can they not get job in the service sector the answer or at least part of the answer be in the early year of young boy live by the age of five the least skilled boy have low academic and non academic skill than the least skilled girl that make it hard for they to attain in school and to develop the perseverance and social skill that they need the physical skill that be reward in the post industrial economy lose out in the move to the service economy how do we fix this and ensure that young boy can get the job that they need in our economy as my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth have point to it be about the early year and even before birth it be first about make their parent live affordable less time for parent worry about bill mean more quality time with their kid and more money in the pocket of parent mean more psychological and material resource to invest in their child secondly invest in high quality early year education be probably the high return investment that any government can make thirdly we have to create good job for graduate and non graduate to move into for both man and woman mass production manufacturing be not come back but we in government can create good non graduate job in construction healthcare and education we must invest in our physical and social infrastructure to create the good job we need where we need they every person should be able to live decent life but as thing stand too many people can not there be many young man whose father leave school and get decent job at the local factory but those young man can not do the same today that disappointment turn to depression anger and division rather than come together we be fall apart strength be find in each of we do well each of we do so with common purpose and connection it be for we in this place on this side to build that nation call the liberal democrat spokesperson can start by warmly congratulate the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on secure this incredibly important debate and on his powerful and insightful opening speech it behove all of we to spend more time on this topic so be grateful that he have make look into it more than have previously it go without say that our education system should enable every child to flourish no matter their gender need or background but as we have hear all too clearly already for too long cohort of boy have fail to thrive in our education system in the way that they should with widen attainment gap between boy and girl particularly among white working class boy we have hear the statistic already and note that many of they come from the excellent report by the centre for social justice but they bear repetition because they be so shocking where of girl be school ready only of boy be in gcse exam boy achieve on average half grade low than girl across every subject and at level girl outperform boy by an average of over grade and half across their good three subject too many boy be quite clearly fail to reach their potential at school and this be have severe and long last consequence for our society and the economy since the pandemic alone the number of young man age to who be not in education employment or training have increase by staggering accord to the higher education policy institute man with no qualification be nearly twice as likely as woman with no qualification to be unemployed and if they be employ they be more likely to work in hazardous menial or stagnant role that make man less likely to look after their mental and physical health lead to high rate of substance abuse smoking and alcohol consumption low life expectancy and much high rate of imprisonment and death by suicide it be hardly surprising that so many boy feel hopeless some of teenager report that they have be teach that young man be problem for society tim page service co ordinator at say there be no trust or hope in the future young man from disadvantaged background have no clear path towards make future for themselves the only option for hundred of boy and young man have work with be crime or benefit think that should make we all stop and reflect education be obviously vital in tackle this tragic and disturbing trend not just to enable pupil to achieve good grade and decent salary but to inspire our child so that they grow up to do good and important thing as part of thriving community and society agree with the hon member for bishop auckland think it probably be time for gender specific strategy look at boy in particular but as the chair of the select committee the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes point out some of the wide systemic challenge face our education system have particular impact on boy as the government be consider number of these issue think it would be worth look at they through gender specific lens we need good teacher to stay in our boy life and to guide and encourage they whether on career option for the future or just as good role model yet over the past year more than state school teacher leave within one year of qualifying and just of the overall teaching workforce be male and of primary school have no male teacher at all be think about this last night actually both my child be at primary school one of they will leave in the next few week and by far and away the teacher that she have talk about the most in her seven year there have be male teacher he have only be teach she for day week in year but all the kid love he and look up to he have never hear they speak about any other teacher in such way it be largely female dominate school and it be wonderful to see such affection for male teacher and such role model for all the child both girl and boy many attribute the shortage of teacher both male and female to the condition that teacher face and lack of career progression believe that the presence of more male teacher would normalise learn as suitable activity for man and boy and may especially help child who do not have positive male role model at home however as the minister know school be face the impossible task of try to find more money in their already squeeze budget to cover underfunded national insurance increase and teacher pay rise while the government have promise to recruit more teacher have yet to see how they will be able to achieve that some of the hopelessness that many boy be experience also stem from inadequate mental health support we know that boy be twice as likely as girl to be exclude from school sadly exclusion and criminal activity be too often intimately related those who be exclude multiple time from school be more likely to have young age of first conviction mental health researcher have note that boy in emotional mental distress tend to use cop strategy that externalise into violence and destruction while girl be more likely to internalise into self harm and depression we liberal democrats have long call for dedicated qualified mental health practitioner to be place in every primary and secondary school to help tackle mental health and behavioural concern early while be glad that the government be continue to roll out mental health support team in school fear that those team be really overstretch because they be often share between several primary and secondary school with perhaps half day or day week of mental health practitioner time in each mean that child do not have consistent access five day week to trusted person to support they with their mental health hope the minister will say something about how the roll out can be speed up and those team grow so that there be more coverage for each of our school of course there be big overlap between mental health provision and special educational need and disability provision boy make up over of those receive special educational need support and over of those on education health and care plan those receive send support be more than twice as likely to be exclude as the average boy and more than five time as likely to be exclude as the average girl too many child be be force out of school due to failure to provide the require support for they to learn have hear time and again from parent and kinship carer who feel that they have be let down by the send system in this country and that they be have to try to educate their child with no support that have very much drive up the number of child be home school so hope the minister will use this opportunity to assure parent and carer of child with send across the country that their right will not be roll back when the government look to reform our broken send system family must be at the heart of these change so that all child can access the support they deserve urge the minister to look at the five principle for send reform that the liberal democrats publish yesterday finally seriously tackle the feeling of hopelessness among young boy mean look at the online world we have see from research that algorithm be feed increasingly violent and misogynistic content towards boy with of child age eight to have social media account it be wrong that company can profit from addictive and harmful algorithm we need to start take health approach to online safety with tight regulation of the tech giant and by empower and educate young people and the adult who care for they about the online world crucially we need to provide alternative space and activity for young people so that they be not always glue to screen when they have spare time the liberal democrats want the digital age of consent raise to end addictive algorithms and to stop company trade on our child attention very much hope that the government will not kowtow to donald trump and remove the digital service tax but instead treble it so that that money can be invest in improve our child wellbee and mental health once again thank the hon member for bishop auckland for secure this important debate and look forward to hear what the minister have to say call the shadow minister in leicestershire where be from it be the last week of term so as we come to the end of the school year my child primary school have only just break up want to thank all the teacher and other staff in our school who have work so hard this year for both our boy and our girl we as mp go in and teach for an hour or something like that and realise how hard it be so we pay tribute to all of they also want to say thank you to the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth who lead we off with an absolutely brilliant speech it really be genuinely brilliant speech see my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who be no long in his place go across the chamber to congratulate he so be sure the whip will have he on defection watch now indeed everyone have give brilliant speech despite the three minute time limit when the hon member for loughborough dr sandher say that he would give we his entire second phd in two minute and second be bit nervous for he but he make good fist of it so well do everybody this be very timely debate people have already talk about the recent report from the centre for social justice and there have also be some great work by the higher education policy institute it be also very important debate and one in which we must not be insular there be global trend in fact the oecd say that of university entrant across the entire developed world be now woman which be huge change right across the industrialise economy in fact woman be the majority of entrant to university in every single oecd country now which would have be mind blow in the those trend can be see here in england and scotland and across the entire uk few member have talk about the intersection of gender ethnicity class income and so on and so forth those intersection be interesting and they show we powerfully how important culture be for example among white boy who be not on free school meal go to university among indian girl who be on free school meal go that be totally against the trend of income and it show the power of culture we can see the big difference between girl and boy at every level of the income distribution the culture for boy when it come to education particularly working class boy be pretty disastrous remember exactly what it be like be in it at school and it have many origin include perhaps the toxic victorian cult of effortless brilliance some people such as mike emmerich in manchester blame it on our early industrialisation and there be still linger bad idea that man job have to involve physical effort but not use the brain it be deeply embed in our culture indeed sometimes think we need to bribe rowling to rewrite harry potter with ron as the diligent swot and hermione as the loyal pal of course it be not rowling fault she be great hero that unhelpful framing of boy as undiligent goofball be in billion aspect of our culture from ad to film to book and it be not at all helpful there be two thing member have often say in these debate over the eight year have be here the willingness to engage in this debate have massively increase over that time some people say that the performance of boy in the education system be pretty inseparable from the performance of the system as whole give that they make up half of all people that be broadly right and rise tide lift all boat on the other hand there be good case for do thing specifically to try and improve the attainment of boy in education both those thing be simultaneously true first we can see the difference that structural reform make if we compare different bit of the uk will not relitigate old argument but for lot of different reason the labour government in wales decide not to do the structural reform that happen in england over the blair period and our period in government they do not do academy accountability measure or the knowledge intensive curriculum the result be startling report by the institute for fiscal studies call major challenge for education in wales point out that amazingly disadvantaged child in england be now do well on pisa than average child in wales there be huge gap from to england go from to seventh in the pisa league table on math while wales go from to on science england go from to ninth while wales go down from to there be big loom gap between england and wales what do that mean for girl and boy on pisa for both england and wales we see that boy do well than girl on math and science but boy do bad than girl on read that gap between england and wales be now so big that on reading boy in england do well than girl in wales and on math and science girl in england do well than boy in wales so the absolute level matter we must remember that while we have talk lot in the debate about relativity ultimately it be the absolute performance that we really care about we want to raise both level particularly give that we be in global economy secondly turn to what we will do specifically to try to improve the performance of boy and will give few relevant example it have already be mention that read for pleasure be down most sharply among boy that be one reason why we will continue to press for action not just to get phone out of our school but more widely as the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for twickenham munira wilson say to tackle the public health and educational problem be cause by the wide shift to smartphone base childhood include on issue such as the age of consent for social medium encourage ministers to fight the good fight on all that stuff we know that boy be much more likely to end up in trouble or in fight at school remember that be the bad single aspect of when be at secondary school few member have mention exclusion be always bit wary of that that be the symptom rather than the cause get behaviour and discipline right be crucial for boy who be often the victim of violence and fight will not relitigate all this stuff but we have school bill that do not have anything to say on discipline the government reject our amendment to add provision on behaviour they have abolish the behaviour hub which be work it go from one third of the school that go through the hub be rat good or outstanding to two third of those school yet the hub have be ax on forthcoming policy as the hon member welcome boy have of all ehcp we know the government have say they be look at end ehcp outside of special school that is about of ehcp or over child we be not at all against reform of special need provision the health minister have say that the government want to see small proportion of pupil in special school too give these issue be now be debate in the public domain as minister think about reform they will need to move fast as be sure they will want to to answer the big question about the idea they have put out that in some case be cause parent worry for example how will the parent of these boy and they be mainly boy know that their child will get what they need if they do not have an ehcp be there not tension between want few pupil in special school and end ehcp outside they what do the minister mean when she say that effective support will not be remove what do effective mean these be all question that be sure the minister be think about they be crucial for boy they be crucial for everyone to be honest totally understand why ministers be look at this accord to the ifs we increase funding by nearly or billion in real term between and that be fast rate of increase but of course it be vital that we get the right answer and certainty for parent as soon as possible will end with couple of question to the minister in opposition the prime minister say that he want to improve employability we have talk about young man who be neets and say we will reinstate two week of compulsory work experience how many school be deliver that now what be the government target to be deliver and by when when will school be see the million that be promise in the labour manifesto to fund that likewise in opposition last year the government announce plan to help school develop young male mentor and to teach pupil how to question the material they see on social medium particularly from people such as andrew tate this be rare example of total agreement between both side of the house we completely agree that we need to push back against terrible role model for boy they be total total total loser teach boy totally terrible idea we hope there will be an opportunity to prosecute some of those people too what have happen to the pledge to get mentor in place let pick up on something that the chair of the select committee the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes say in her excellent speech she talk about the gender pay gap think this be interesting and it need careful analysis for to year old the gender pay gap now do not exist it be actually negative for the young of that group and it appear to get big with age but it be actually not gender pay gap per se it be motherhood pay gap commend the work of ruxandra teslo be sure the chair of the select committee be very familiar with it she show that the later woman delay have child the high their income and unfortunately the few child they get to have think be in agreement with department for education ministers in think that that be unacceptable and must be change on that rare note of terrify consensus let draw my remark to close by once again congratulate the hon member for bishop auckland who be quite right to bring this debate to the house he give an excellent speech be strike by the way the debate on this issue have change even in the time have be here it be more clearly identify as problem and by synthesise the argument in such an excellent way today he have help to propel the argument forward add my congratulation to my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on secure this very thoughtful and important debate he make powerful opening speech add my welcome to cian and alex who be on work experience here in parliament support my hon friend he touch on really pressing and important issue we know that on average boy have low attainment than girl as government we be determined to understand and address the driver behind that all child should have the opportunity to achieve and thrive in their education no matter who they be or where they be from that be the drive mission of our opportunity mission we be determined to break the unfair link between background and success we be determined to drive educational excellence across the country for every child and young person to do that many of the issue that have be highlight need to be address the current school system have many strength but as set out starkly by my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons and my hon friend the member for cannock chase josh newbury we know it be not work well enough for all child too many be fall behind and face barrier which hold they back from the opportunity and life chance they deserve as in previous year girl continue to do well than boy across all headline measure although the gap have narrow compare with there be clearly still more to do the department be commit to address that challenge the school white paper which will be publish in the autumn will set out our vision for school system that drive educational excellence for every child we be work alongside sir hamid patel and estelle morris who be gather view from thousand of child parent teacher and leader across the year to build solid evidence base on the barrier to attainment for white working class child and to look at what solution there be to drive up standard for they the inquiry be look to get under the bonnet of what factor be drive underperformance what good practice can support they and what policy can well be apply to address the challenge that work will contribute to the regional improvement in standard and excellence team the rise team and to our focus as department on raise attainment across the board high and rise standard be the key to strengthen outcome and close attainment gap help every child and young person to achieve and thrive we want our reform to the school system deliver through excellent teaching and leadership high quality curriculum strong accountability and an inclusive system which remove the barrier to learn that be hold far too many child back mention the excellent teaching we need because the quality of teaching be the single most important in school factor to improve outcome for child especially those from disadvantaged background that be why we be commit to recruit an additional new expert teacher in secondary school special school and further education college we have make strong initial progress to deliver the key pledge and our investment be start to deliver up to the workforce have grow by full time equivalent in secondary and special school those be the school that need these teacher the most agree that it be important that the teaching profession reflect the community that it serve and that child see themselves reflect in the role model around they male teacher and educator can clearly play an important role in teaching guide and lead the boy in our classroom however as the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for twickenham munira wilson and my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes rightly say man be under represent across the teaching workforce over three quarter be female although that be broadly in line with international trend and have be stable in england for some time we need to do well we want to see representation increase across all phase and we be work to recruit and retain high quality teacher in our classroom we know that our recruitment campaign be reach diverse audience and they widely feature male teacher acknowledge the challenge that be so eloquently set out by my hon friend the member for bishop auckland agree that every child and young person should have the opportunity to achieve and thrive in education regardless of their background that be why we have also commission an independent panel of expert to review the exist national curriculum and assessment system we want to ensure an excellent foundation in the core subject of reading writing and math and rich broad and inclusive curriculum that ready young people for life and work we want curriculum that reflect our whole society ensure that child feel inspire and engage in it my hon friend the member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor mention the value of time and support for young people to take part in sport very much agree the curriculum and assessment review be consider specifically how to remove the exist block to progress to ensure good outcome for child and young people from socioeconomically disadvantaged background or who be otherwise vulnerable the review publish its interim finding early this year it highlight the gap in attainment and commit to address the challenge and barrier hold child back from the opportunity and life chance that they deserve we look forward to receive the final recommendation in the autumn as my hon friend the members for heywood and middleton north mrs blundell and for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter set out powerfully school disengagement and exclusion be incredibly damaging and significant concern every child deserve to learn in safe and calm classroom and we will always help our hard work teacher to make that happen school should take proportionate and measure step to create calm and supportive classroom that be how to break down the barrier to opportunity and improve the life chance for all pupil however we know that poor behaviour can be root in much wide issue the government be develop an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty lead by taskforce co chair by the education secretary so that we can break down the barrier to opportunity all school be require by law to have behaviour policy with effective strategy to encourage good behaviour school leader must develop and implement policy that have the support of the school and align with its culture but acknowledge the challenge that colleague have outline education have crucial role to play in help child and young people to develop empathy boundary and respect for difference through compulsory relationship education all pupil should learn how to form positive and respectful relationship we be review the relationship sex and health education guidance to ensure that it empower school to tackle harmful behaviour start in the early year of primary school it will be clear that teacher must facilitate conversation with student on what positive masculinity and femininity mean in today world and on develop positive role model to build student self esteem and sense of purpose we will publish the revised rshe guidance which will include the importance of build communication skill express and understand boundary handle disappointment and pay attention to the need and preference of other it will explore communication and ethic within relationship and support young people to think about what healthy relationship involve beyond consent include kindness attention and care it will consider the real life complexity of relationship include the significance of power vulnerability and manage difficult emotion that can relate to relationship such as disappointment and anger and the influence of online misogynistic content and the impact of pornography on sexual behaviour include what some people perceive as normal all those issue will be address and we want to empower school to tackle these very important issue with young people close to million to year old be not in education employment or training that number be too high and the consequence be serious my hon friend the members for stafford leigh ingham and for loughborough dr sandher highlight the cost of this not only to the individual themselves but to our society alongside the development of the youth guarantee we be require local authority to ensure that every young person receive suitable offer of place in education or training we need to address the underlying risk factor for become neet and that include support young people mental health with access to specialist mental health professional in every school and mental health support team in every college young people need effective transition as well between school further education and employment to prevent those moment of disengagement we will continue to work to ensure that young people can unlock the opportunity that we know will set they up for life thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland again for raise these really important matter of concern and thank all those who have contribute to this thoughtful debate readily acknowledge that there be number of challenge to boy attainment and engagement there be much more we can do and that be why the government be focus on take action to ensure that every child and young person believe that success belong to they will keep this brief because be conscious that the next debate be also of great importance thank everybody who have attend and contribute to the debate they be excellent contribution be grateful for the cross party support on this issue look forward to read the government white paper on school standard to be publish in the autumn and engage with they on that will write to the minister on how we can do more to embed social and emotional learning in early year setting question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the attainment and engagement of boy in education child health beg to move that this house have consider child health thank the backbench business committee for grant this incredibly important debate this government ambition be to raise the healthy generation of child ever there be so much about improve child health in the year plan fit for the future be genuinely quite excited about the year plan maybe be sad but that be the sort of thing that excite have be gp for year and have special interest in child health and child mental health will talk briefly about prevention mental health and then paediatric service first obesity be massive problem in young people at the age of five of child be obese by the age of be obese and that do not count the child who be overweight this start in pregnancy we must ensure that pregnant woman have really healthy diet because that reduce obesity when baby be bear parent need to be aware that follow on milk and hungry baby milk be basically just milk pack full of sugar that will not do the child any good if they be hungry they need to change their diet and possibly go on to solid baby snack often look healthy they might have nice healthy carrot on they but when we look at what be in they they be pack full of sugar as well parent need to have clear idea of what be healthy so that they can choose the healthy food for their child the government be go to bring in watershed for junk food advertising it be go to be in october but it be now promise for january that be incredibly important because young people be very sensitive to advertising recent report in the bmj find more than different sponsorship deal in football and six other sport with food that be high in fat salt and sugar we need to look at that issue because young people look up to sport star and be very influenceable they have to advertise healthy food because otherwise we will continue to have an obesity epidemic in the year plan be delighted to see measure in the national planning policy framework about fast food outlet near school we must stop those they be cynically place close to school and they be particularly prevalent in more deprive area couple of other thing that be delighted about include free school meal for child from household in receipt of universal credit free school meal have an obvious relationship to obesity and tend to bring it down be also delighted that in the autumn we will look at school food standard and hopefully reduce the amount of process meat that seem to be in lot of school food the other part of the year plan that excite be the mandatory health food sale with supermarket that have be evidence to reduce obesity so be delighted about that let move on quickly to physical exercise be keen for other member to get the opportunity to talk because of child be not sufficiently active and two third can not swim metre do my hon friend agree that the previous government lack of investment in vital leisure facility such as the swimming pool in atherstone in my constituency which be overdue for renovation be cause many of these problem the lack of pe in school and the lack of safe place for child to play be active and get involve in sport be cause some of the obesity problem totally agree indeed my hon friend pre empt some of my remark another proposal in the year plan involve the investment through sports england of million into such opportunity for child the starlight children foundation promote play and exercise and be particular fan of adventure playground in urban area which allow child to cut loose particularly after school expend energy and have fun in safe setting be also work with colleague on access to nature it be incredibly important that every child have access to nature so that they can explore nature and have that type of exercise also stress that of child have active travel bike or walk to get themselves to school let we increase that let we try to get more child cycle and walk to school as that will increase their fitness dental care be also in the year plan be delighted to see that supervised brushing be already there and also that fluoride varnish will be apply by people to prevent dental carie from occur will give quick shout out on asthma prevention which be key and all about air quality know some young people who since the ultra low emission zone scheme be introduce have stop use their inhaler because pollution have go down that be something we must emphasise on air quality will my hon friend join in pay tribute to the stop the stink campaigner in newcastle under lyme who fight so hard to clean the air around school such as st mary primary school on silverdale road their work help to make the lung of our young people that bit healthy absolutely and thank my hon friend for that intervention he be right clean air be one way to address our five most preventable health risk and we must do more on that will my hon friend join in call on the government to adopt world health organisation level for particulate matter be afraid that be not my special area but it sound like good idea and thank my hon friend because we can not see clean air we do not realise what it be do but people genuinely need their inhaler less and particularly for young people with asthma that be incredibly important want to talk quickly about early year support in gloucestershire an organisation call home start involve volunteer go into the home of woman who have just give birth to support they interestingly woman who have have that support often go on to be volunteer it be fantastic organisation this week be delighted that the successor to sure start best start family hub be come back sure start be one of the most glorious thing that the blair government do and it affect the health of young people enormously be pleased that childcare be get much more funding furthermore as set out in the year plan healthy start will be restart in provide money to pregnant woman and child age one to four whose family be in financial difficulty help those who be less well off mental healthcare be in bit of crisis some of young people have mental health issue we spend only of nhs fund on mental health but it contribute to over of morbidity about million people be on the child and adolescent mental health service waiting list at the moment and know that minister be do all that they can to bring that down to prevent poor mental health we need to look at exercise as have mention and at music in school which be prove to reduce rate of mental ill health be back the national education union campaign to get rid of sats which cause enormous tension and stress in young people on treatment be delighted that we will have mental health support team in every school understand that will be in place by next april and by the end of this parliament we will have more mental health worker and whole school approach particularly endorse the mental health first aid training that have happen in some stroud school and have also be look at the young futures hub with the massive camhs waiting list in my area people sometimes have to wait for two year and the sudden increase in neurodiversity we need to look at scheme that use creative and social prescription to deal with those child while they be on the waiting list give the right support reckon lot of they will not need specialist psychiatric assessment be chair of the beyond pill all party parliamentary group be hon member aware that one in eight to year old have be put on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant that be scandalous this year host roundtable at the royal college of paediatrics and child health child be generally wait long than adult for care which we must turn around as say there be often long waiting list for mental healthcare sadly harry the son of my constituent louise turner have sarcoma and die at the end of last year she report that the nursing staff and doctor be fantastic but there be lack of facility such that sometimes they would turn up for chemotherapy but there be no bed for harry so they have to go away and come back the next day go forward we must ensure that that do not happen what be the solution we need to get paediatric care out of the hospital and into the community we need to get hot paediatric feverish kid see in the community potentially by paediatrician or well train gps furthermore during gp training which have carry out for about year it be essential that every single doctor who become gp have time in paediatric assessment unit the main feedback from the roundtable at the royal college of paediatrics and child health be that we must involve child in design paediatric service otherwise they will not work rise order to ensure everyone get to contribute we will have to have three minute speaking limit call sarah hall if we want to raise generation of healthy thriving child we must stop treat child health as an afterthought this week launch new survey ask constituent to feed into my work and thank everyone who have respond the response have help to shape my contribution to this debate today along with my work as chair of the all party parliamentary group on inclusion and nurture in education the focus of the survey be child their education and wellbeing hear from parent carer and guardian about their child experience in school and in access health service about their child mental health and the anxiety and stress cause by an outdated education system and about barrier to access education because of their child neurodiversity or disability family tell that there be long waiting list for camhs and gap in speech and language therapy and school base special educational need co ordinator support they tell about narrow criterion that be limit health and care support and how those criterion do not reflect their child unique need result in family feel lose in the system the nhs be found on the promise that care would be there when we need it no matter our income or postcode but for too many child and family that promise be fray infant mortality remain stubbornly high condition such as asthma obesity and dental decay be send more child into hospital and mental health need be rise with long waiting list for specialist service sadly health inequality remain stubbornly persistent and be undeniably link to the unacceptable level of child poverty and deprivation child health outcome have be allow to decline for too long we know that the child health workforce be work incredibly hard but over the last year it have be underfunde and undervalue child and young people be wait significantly long than adult for access to health service with wait for more than week compare with of adult those number represent gap in provision in my own integrate health board area of cheshire and merseyside more than child be wait for the care they need some of child be wait between and week and of child have be wait more than week for treatment the royal college have give ministers road map include shift care close to home to transform child community service introduce dedicated waiting time target for child service and establish child health investment standard however we can not talk about child health in isolation from poverty we know that poverty increase the risk of poor mental and physical health miss developmental milestone and poor outcome in school without real investment in family income housing and food security we be simply paper over the crack if we be serious about give every child fair start tackle poverty must be at the front and centre that be why be pleased to hear that warrington will benefit from the government new plan to fund the new family hub model in our town it be one thing to fund service but it be another to ensure that they truly reach and uplift the child who need they the most thank the hon member for stroud dr opher for bring such an important debate feel strongly about this matter have train as dietician and understand the implication that poor diet in early life can have for child future from health outcome to educational outcome poor nutrition have serious detrimental and long term effect the hon member mention many other health condition but will talk just about diet we often assume that parent understand what constitute healthy diet for their child but sadly that assumption be often false there be so many compete message in this space accord to the british nutrition foundation nearly one third of parent say that they be uncertain about how much their child should eat more than third admit that they regularly make their child finish everything on their plate regardless of hunger or nutritional need these be not bad parent they be well mean family try their good in an environment that fail to equip they with the knowledge they need and that often make healthy choice less accessible even when parent have some nutritional awareness that knowledge do not always translate into healthy practice research show that inconsistent portioning and irregular parental eating habit can contribute to poor outcome even among family with high nutritional literacy in short good intention be be undermine by lack of clear practical guidance that be not new problem but it be grow with time as we have hear across the uk of child age four to five be overweight or obese by the age of to that figure rise to the covid pandemic deepen the crisis during lockdown many family see sharp rise in unhealthy snacking and reduce access to fresh nutritious food in home where both time and money be tight convenience often win out over balance the cost of inaction be already visible and it be vast obesity relate condition cost the nhs more than billion year and the wide cost to society stand at around billion annually without meaningful intervention that figure be project to rise by billion by meaningful intervention must include access to nhs dentist child with mouth full of rotten tooth can not enjoy an apple or crunch on carrot as healthy snack dental health be really important to healthy diet when we talk about child health we often think about the start of life safe birth vaccination and early year support but we also need to talk about those child whose life will be short those with life limit and life threaten condition across the country family care for seriously ill child face unimaginable challenge yet too often the support they need simply be not there especially at the end of life and especially at home in my constituency we be incredibly fortunate to be serve by shooting star children hospices which support over child and family across borough and throughout surrey however because the number of child need that care in each individual borough be small those child can easily be overlook that be the problem with system build around commission at such local level when the number be low the need get lose that be why the ringfenced central funding formerly the child hospice grant be so important it support hospice such as shooting star to provide respite symptom management bereavement support and end of life care and help give family choice at the hard possible time welcome the government decision to confirm million for child hospice in nhs england funding for alongside million in capital investment across all hospice the truth be that the sector remain under real strain accord to together for short life the lead voice for child palliative care just of icb formally commission end of life care at home and third be still fail to meet even the basic national standard have three question for the minister will the government commit to maintain and increase the child hospice grant beyond will they launch proper review of how child palliative care be fund and plan and will the minister hold icb to great account to ensure they meet their legal duty to commission that care and report transparently on progress we be tell that the year nhs plan will bring care close to home but right now there be no mention of child palliative care in that plan and no clarity on how those vital service will be fund that have to change thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for secure this important debate one of the most frequent issue raise with in lowestoft be dentistry and the situation be particularly acute for child as we have hear one in four five year old experience tooth decay and preventable tooth decay remain one of the top reason for hospital admission that be why the government roll out of supervised tooth brush in our most deprive area and the inclusion of dental service in the roll out of family hub be so welcome child from deprived area be almost three time more likely to have dental decay than those from less deprive area one in three child in my constituency of lowestoft be in relative poverty poverty that be link to and compound health problem as such one of the most effective way to tackle poor child health be to reduce the number of child live in poverty something that the last labour government do to great effect that record will be build on by this government forthcoming child poverty strategy which hope will set out clear and bold target alongside path to reach those target as have be mention one of the big health crisis face child today be mental health some of child and young people mental health service report that they be struggle to keep up with demand hope the government will continue to look at the grow evidence that link access to social medium and addictive smartphone with child poor mental health but their commitment to roll out mental health support team to all school and college by be hugely welcome be glad that the year health plan that the health secretary set out week ago begin an important shift towards prevention and early intervention and welcome the plan aim to end the obesity epidemic remain concerned that the ban on advertise unhealthy food and drink will mean that brand can continue to advertise so long as they do not explicitly identify their unhealthy product and hope that the government will consider how to deal with that issue finally will speak to the physical punishment of child it be simply unacceptable in that child have less protection from assault and battery than adult do particularly when it have such poor health implication for example research from the royal college of paediatrics and child health have find that child who be physically punish be up to time more likely to experience mental health problem that be why of healthcare professional and public health organisation want to see the law in this area change follow the lead of over country around the world include scotland and wales we must remove the reasonable punishment defence which continue to allow child to be harm urge the government to see this as child health issue and in the interest of child wellbee use the legislative opportunity present by the children wellbeing and schools bill which be currently be consider in the other place to end it we know the problem face child health and we know the scale of those problem there be more than enough evidence so in the time have will focus on some of the solution welcome the government commitment to roll forward youth hub to recruit mental health worker and through the plan for change to introduce best starts our revamp sure start centre an excellent institute for fiscal studies report show the effect of sure start and its finding should inform how we develop best starts do not want to spend long time talk about how we reframe the architecture and the organisation that deliver child health but do think that be not quite in the right place service user fundamentally do not care about who deliver what service they just want the high quality service my concern be that we have service concentrate at the local authority level for child health when they should not be place there we know that the well run service be typically health service because they have structural advantage in term of datum and the experience of spend capital funding and get thing off the ground quickly we also know that some of the experience of child social care be not entirely as they should be the attempt to unify child health and child social care within local authority with director for child service in an upper tier local authority have have mixed record and it would be wise for we to think about whether child social care or indeed adult social care ought be put at the local authority level or whether there ought to be different place to deliver it perhaps at national level and perhaps at national health level in previous life before be elect run mental health domestic abuse and homelessness service and embed caseworker in local authority setting to support family with mental health issue domestic abuse prevalence and substance misuse also deliver service as part of the last government community mental health framework particularly personality disorder service the embed of third sector organisation be definitely positive there be limit to what they can do but they can do outstanding thing they can build strong relationship with people who often lack trust in statutory agency and they can deliver bespoke support often beside nhs or local authority support would therefore want large role for our third sector in closing want to talk about special educational need and disability we all know that the system be break we know that it be adversarial we know that parent be at break point we know that there be not enough space in specialist provision we know too that ehcp take too long and the process be difficult as consequence it can feel dehumanising look forward to the government work collaboratively with family put they at the heart of change to develop the good solution have survey available to constituent in bournemouth east and encourage they to complete it or to email because need to hear from they in order to represent they to government so that we can get the good possible system in london of reception age child be overweight or obese and that nearly double to of child in year the crisis of childhood obesity do not just pose future health risk rather it be impact child right now factor include lack of after school activity deprivation and poverty the constant bombardment of fast food advert and the concentration of fast food chain near school however for the sake of brevity will focus on the proximity of fast food outlet to school and the constant advertising campaign against child in ilford south there be nearly more fast food chain than there be year ago despite plan restriction applicant always find loophole to exploit that be compound by the fact that healthy food be double the price of fast food and that the closure of youth centre mean there be limited place for kid to exercise fast food outlet have become the cheap most convenient and easy choice for kid to go after school welcome the new national planning policy framework which empower local council with strong power to block fast food outlet from open near school allow authority to prioritise child health the second insidious factor coerce these child into consume fast food be the relentless barrage of advertising alarmingly many advert be specifically design to target child bite back youth lead movement challenge the food system survey some of the uk large company and report that of product specifically aim at child be class as unhealthy for child from deprive area the advertising campaign be even more severe because junk food ad be six time more likely to appear in deprive area than wealthy area these company be exploit child especially those in poverty for profit bite back put it just about right fast food advertising be enticing effective and everywhere childhood obesity be not simply the result of poor personal choice or bad parenting structural factor coerce child into make unhealthy choice as government it be our duty to recognise the social and financial cost of allow this to continue and we be show courage and make progress by empower local council ban advertising and deliver the nhs year plan which centre prevention we be lay the groundwork for last change we may not reap the benefit tomorrow or next year but in five or year we will see child live long and healthy because of the choice we make today today want to speak about group of young people who be too often overlook in our healthcare system teenager and young people with cancer every day in the uk seven young people be tell the devastating word you have cancer that be not just statistic it be wake up call for all of we cancer remain the big disease relate killer of young people in our country yet their unique experience and their physical psychological and social need be too often sideline if we be serious about improve outcome for they we need to act on three front first we need fast diagnosis young people must be give clear accessible information about the symptom of cancer and our primary care system must be well equip to spot those symptom early secondly we need access to clinical trial welcome the conversation that representative of the teenage cancer trust and have only last week with the minister for public health on this very issue young people currently participate in trial at low rate than other group so they miss out on cut edge treatment that could save life thirdly we need to address mental health more than half of young people with cancer experience poor mental health and almost nine in psychologist say that our current service can not meet demand cancer do not just interrupt young life but collide with it at time of exam discover new relationship identity growth and development and the least that we can do be make sure that our system do not fail young people let we ensure that the next national cancer plan reflect this reality and let we give all these young people the care and support that they deserve thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher for secure this debate like many colleague in this house stand for election on promise to help raise the healthy generation of child in our country history bold ambition but worthy one in order to get there we need to look beyond the doctor office or the dinner table one of the most powerful and often overlook tool that we have be physical activity sport and play and the chance to be outside when sport and play be part of child daily life they become training ground not just for the body but for life in stafford and across our village have see brilliant teacher and community worker help child to build the skill and confidence they need to stay engaged one young constituent tane speak honestly to about what he see among his peer rise mental health struggle too much time online and worrying dip in resilience he be right because when child do not get the opportunity to move and play it affect their wellbeing and education but also their future where else but in sport do child learn how to lose with grace win with kindness and keep go when thing get tough but not all child have parent who can afford to pay for club kit or transport for many school be the only place where they will ever get to be part of team or even discover sport they love that be why pe should never be see as optional it must be core part of every school week welcome the government renew support for school sport partnership and their commitment to equality between girl and boy in sport but we can go far that mean multi year funding settlement that school can count on and clear ambition that every child no matter their background have access to sport and play in stafford have be campaign for more inclusive public play place family of disabled and neurodivergent child tell they avoid park because they have nothing that their child can safely enjoy campaigner have speak powerfully about this as christine mcguinness do only yesterday play be not luxury it be essential for child development their health and their joy be grateful to my constituency neighbour for give way for every christine in stafford there be christine in newcastle under lyme too and one unite point that my hon friend and will no doubt put to our colleague at staffordshire county council be for they to play their part and to play their part fast be already on record as criticise staffordshire county council today so will hold off in this debate although it could be well at everything my commitment to play be why co sponsor the amendment to the planning and infrastructure bill in the name of my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes that seek to provide in law for sufficient play opportunity especially inclusive play opportunity call on the government to invest in potential and to give every child the opportunity to grow up healthy confident and importantly resilient ready not just for school but for life call the liberal democrat spokesperson would like to begin by pay tribute to wonderful charity base in mid sussex call group strep support ever since its founder jane lose her own baby theo year ago jane and the team have be campaign for well outcome for pregnant woman who contract group strep because the impact on their baby can be profound it be the most common cause of life threaten infection for newborn baby open by ask the minister whether she will meet the team from group strep support so she can well understand the potential of well screening of pregnant mother as mother myself do not take for grant the health of my child all of we who be parent know that the health of our child can turn on sixpence we also know that the system that surround child and family and keep child healthy have be allow to crumble as hon member have say we be in the middle of child health crisis in this country this week the children commissioner produce damn report on the health of child across the country the review tell we that child in england be face dickensian level of poverty and be go without basic need like heating place to wash somewhere to eat breakfast or safe transport to school hon member use the word unacceptable lot in this place and it may be overuse but in this case it be very true we should be ashamed that child be face this reality in our young people who should expect to grow up to be part of prosperous happy and successful nation in the come year be be let down under the conservatives thing get bad and bad on their watch in the period from to alone the number of child wait for over week for an appointment increase by for elective paediatric service and by for community health service however this situation be not inevitable the uk have world lead researcher passionate healthcare worker and proud tradition of protect public health britain child should be among the healthy in the world we be wealthy country with welfare state and universal healthcare however we lag behind our peer one in child live with asthma and our country have one of the high emergency admission rate for school age asthma in europe it be avoidable yet it be still happen the number of child live with life limit condition have rise by in less than two decade some million child in england be live with obesity as other hon member have mention this afternoon and over million of they already have health complication almost one in five child now struggle with their mental health which be increase in just five year however child be wait long than ever to be see since paediatric waiting list have grow by over child but the number of consultant have barely budge with over child now wait for more than year to be see the conservatives let those problem pile up now the labour government can not afford inaction the liberal democrats believe that every child deserve the good start in life no matter their background postcode or parent income we also think that it benefit we all to have happy and healthy child grow up across the country we would start by fix the nhs from top to bottom which mean ensure that everyone can see gp within seven day or hour if it be urgent welcome the announcement in the nhs year plan that same day appointment will become available where necessary my colleague and will push the government to ensure that that pledge become reality fix the nhs also mean end the scandal of child turn up to hospital with mouth full of rot tooth because there be no dentistry nearby it mean rebuild the primary care and community service that have be starve of fund for over decade know from conversation with my constituent in mid sussex that those problem be very real and with they happen in what be relatively well off part of the country it be clear that they be systemic however it be not just about treat illness we have to be determined to prevent it that be why we would reverse the conservative cut to public health and invest in programme that get child move eat well and thriving we would tackle the poverty that drive so many health issue by end the cruel two child limit and reverse the benefit cap we would expand free school meal to all child in poverty and work towards universal free meal in primary school we be glad to see the government listen to liberal democrat call for an expansion of free school meal and be campaign for that to go even far because no child should go hungry at school ever when it come to mental health we would transform the system from the ground up that mean have mental health hub for young people in every community regular check up at key point in life dedicated mental health professional in every school and proper cross government strategy to understand and tackle the root cause from bereavement to bullying and social medium pressure child mental health be not just health issue it be an education issue family issue and justice issue it need more than one department and more than one minister my liberal democrat colleague have lead the fight for early intervention for holistic support and for real accountability we have champion idea such as register of bereaved child because how can we help if we do not even know who need support ask the minister to therefore commit to implement such register we face real challenge but we have the idea the evidence and the plan now someone have to get on and deliver the change that child across the uk so desperately need so urge the government to take action let we build country where no child be leave behind and where every child and parent have at the very least the opportunity to be healthy and to look to the future with confidence call the shadow minister before start should declare my interest as consultant paediatrician and member of the royal college of paediatrics and child health which the hon member for stroud dr opher mention early congratulate he on secure this important debate get the right start in life be one of the most important factor in adult health and wellbeing we must ensure that the nhs be provide the good treatment and preventive care available for child while prioritise safety and convenience for patient and cost effectiveness for taxpayer have see significant improvement in paediatric care in my career we must look broadly at the social and environmental factor that affect child health and ask what more we can do to help protect and prevent illness in child prevention be well than cure which be one of the government three shift with which agree and on which wish to focus today often child bring to hospital to see consultant paediatrician have condition that have be cause or far complicated by social and environmental factor these be thing that medic can not treat on their own and as every professional know we must work with parent family and child to achieve the very good outcome one very clear example be the childhood obesity crisis which many right hon and hon member have mention already this afternoon research show that of child in year these be and year old be now overweight or obese have see some extreme case in my practice for example nine year old who weigh over kg of young patient who have suffer serious illness because of their weight these be the tip of the iceberg but they be undoubtedly part of much broad shift we know what cause obesity lack of exercise and diet too high in calorie but this be more complicated than that there be complex problem with root in broad issue such as poverty and family work pattern the government can not determine what each child eat but there be thing that they can and should do to help support parent and their child what be the minister do to encourage exercise participation in sport and active travel to school what be she do to improve the quality and availability of food for parent and family what be she do to improve the quality of school food to build nutrition education into the curriculum and to help child learn about manage their own health and how to cook healthy food know the year plan include reference to the reformulation of some product but there be risk that manufacturer encourage to remove sugar from product will simply replace it with sweetener and other chemical what be the minister do to ensure that they do not solve one problem and then walk unwittingly into another the hon member for lowestoft jess asato mention tooth brushing we often hear that tooth extraction be the lead cause of hospital admission among young child can the minister provide detail on the step that she be take to improve youth dental outcome such as broaden access to nhs dentist pursue fluoridisation scheme and encourage the use of fluoride varnish parent have responsibility here too accord to the chief dental officer who speak to the other day child who brush their tooth twice day with fluoride toothpaste reduce the amount of high sugar drink they consume and reduce the sugar in their diet can significantly reduce the risk of need filling and have dental decay another area raise today be mental health young people face mental health pressure from home and school worry friendship concern and many other factor in particular we know that the covid lockdown have serious impact on child development and socialisation we also know that social medium be cause increase harm to child whether by contribute to anxiety about body image or personal achievement or by expose child to harmful material and idea the previous government online safety act be welcome step in address some of these issue but the government reject conservative amendment to the children wellbeing and schools bill to help reduce the use of phone in school what more do the minister plan to do to encourage child away from their screen and back towards healthy existence with their friend and family also want to discuss neglect total of child be currently on child protection plan for reason of neglect marked increase from in organisation such as the national society for the prevention of cruelty to child have highlight the fact that number be typically underestimate in neglect case but we should not underestimate the harm cause to health and development by neglect what step be the department and the government in general taking to get more accurate picture of neglect and to intervene on behalf of the child who be suffer one area of improvement be the balance of acute and community care and again the government have talk about this in their three shift we know the government be keen to move acute care into the community but do the minister agree that we should ensure that core community care be available more widely and more quickly in the community first before give they extra work to do too often in my practice see child with paediatric problem who have be refer to hospital because of long wait and capacity problem in the community what step be the minister take to ensure that there be enough supply in the community sector to deal with the problem that child face in summary child health be large and complex policy area we know that we can make good progress when we treat these complex condition with new research and novel treatment we know that most child will get well in fact one reason that enjoy paediatric be that almost all the patient get well because they be robust resilient and great fun we must help parent do thing that help protect child health today and prepare those child to manage their own health tomorrow now call the minister who have up to pm although we do need few minute at the end for the lead member to wind up congratulate my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher on secure this debate he be tireless advocate for child across the country also pay tribute to his campaigning on social prescribing before he come to this place because it be now key part of our year plan for health this issue be dear to my heart one of the reason stand for parliament be that nearly quarter of the kid in skelmersdale the big town in my constituency live in poverty as many colleague have point out the state of child health be national scandal as my hon friend the member for stroud say and as be refer to by the shadow minister this be complex issue that straddle variety

tooth decay we have invest million in supervise tooth brushing for three to five year old in our most deprived community we be go far than ever before to tackle long waiting time for child through our

of sure start which be lifeline for work family under the last labour government early this week we publish the give every child the good start in life strategy and we will provide funding to every

drink industry levy introduce healthy food sale report and ultimately use that reporting to set new sale target the government have regulation in place to set nutritional compositional and labelling standard for commercial baby food and we continue to challenge the industry to take further action provide advice and guidance for parent enforcement of nutrition legislation be the responsibility of local authority good nutrition in the early year be vital we recognise that there be opportunity to support parent and make the healthy choice easy by encourage business to improve baby food will set out our plan on that soon we be also determined to fix the special educational need and disability system and restore the trust of parent by ensure that school have the tool to well identify and support child before issue escalate to crisis point this autumn the government will bring forward school white paper which will detail our approach to send reform ensure join up support for child and

household on universal credit from april we will be increase the value of healthy start payment by be also member of the child poverty taskforce and the strategy on this will be publish later this year again thank my hon friend the member for stroud for raise this vital topic and all other colleague for speak today when he launch our manifesto my right hon friend the prime minister promise to restore the bond that reach through the generation and say this country will be well for your child that be what we be do with our year plan look forward to work with my hon friend and all other colleague to get this do will not keep hon member long know it be late on thursday and people want to get back to their constituency thank all hon member include the minister and opposition members for stay and give excellent speech if we get child health right it will bring whole lifetime of benefit that be why child health be so important it be about get they to do regular exercise which will continue for life and to have decent diet which will also continue for life make they the healthy generation we have ever know so thank member and the minister very much question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider child health disabled bus passes motion make and question propose that this house do now wakeford it be pleasure to stand here today and raise once again the issue of restriction on the use of disabled bus pass the minister will be well aware of this matter which have raise with he on number of occasion and have already have the opportunity to discuss it with he directly for which be grateful however want to use today debate not only to underline the real and lasting impact that these restriction have on disabled people life but to make clear case for why it be the government responsibility to address this inequality currently under the english national concessionary travel scheme eligible disabled people be entitle to some limit free local bus travel it be policy rightly design to help those who for physical or legal reason be unable to drive the scheme play vital role in help disabled people to stay connected with healthcare work education family and the wide community and society young people in education or apprenticeship include my son george at linwood provision be unable to learn to drive as easily because of their complex need yet while their parent currently have to pay to get they to college in the morning they can use their free bus pass to get home that be completely counterintuitive and be restrict the choice of young people at time when they should be expand their independence do my hon friend have any comment on that thank my hon friend for her intervention she speak extensively about an area in which know she be champion completely agree with she if we be give people disabled bus pass we be do that for reason and those reason often do not apply only from be onwards that bring to the next part of my speech from pm to be on weekday the english national concessionary travel scheme entitlement become postcode lottery and be dependent on whether local authority or transport authority choose to extend the benefit and crucially whether it can afford to do so from some already stretch local budget disability action yorkshire charity base in my constituency and one whose work extend across the wide region bring this issue to my attention early this year and indeed last year at local panel event where local people point out the barrier they face to participate in our society service user rightly point out the absurd contradiction in provide travel path for disabled individual that be design to improve accessibility only to then restrict its use to peak hour the absurdity lie in the obvious truth that disability do not appear only at peak time there be approximately disabled bus pass holder in england represent about of all concessionary travel user the department for transport have on several occasion point to the fact that of local authority offer some form of free travel before suggest that the issue be relative minor but frame it in that way obscure the reality on the ground in many area include my constituency free travel be still not permit until after am make travel to work education or early medical appointment financially and logistically difficult for disabled people in fact research show that of transport authority offer unrestricted access for disabled passenger the result be postcode lottery and the majority of disabled people remain constrain by an arbitrary time restriction that do not reflect the demand of their daily life let we be clear the time restriction may be more relevant for old pass holder who make up of concessionary user and be in general less likely to be commute to work or education but that simply do not apply to many disabled people with disabled bus pass holder typically be of work age we live in country where disabled people continue to face unnecessary and unacceptable barrier whether physical financial or social we must be honest that we be simply not do enough to break down those barrier remove the weekday time restriction on disabled bus pass would be straightforward immediate and meaningful step in the right direction end the restriction would do more than improve access to transport it would promote great independence for disabled people it would support health and wellbee by reduce social isolation and make it easy to attend early morning medical appointment which be often difficult or costly to reach under the current rule it would also contribute to environmental goal by encourage great use of public transport over less sustainable alternative most importantly by allow disabled people to travel freely we enable full participation in community life whether that be volunteer social engagement work or education in do so we would take meaningful step toward great social inclusion and more equal society for disabled people thank my hon friend for secure this debate on such an important topic he be make an excellent speech do he agree that this be of particular importance in rural area because bus service be sparse and travel distance be long have be approach by campaigner from mencap herefordshire who have run an amazing campaign on this topic do he agree that the postcode lottery between different authority mean that there be great unfairness for disabled people and that the good way to deal with this be through national not local change completely agree with my hon friend sentiment my constituency be in north yorkshire vast rural area where we have exactly the same challenge that she describe in her own patch the impact of this restrictive rule be particularly clear when we listen to young disabled people themselves in recent conversation with whizz kidz charity that support young people with disability it highlight the specific harm this restriction cause for young wheelchair user the charity recently conduct survey ask whether free bus travel would make difference unsurprisingly the overwhelming response be yes young people say that all day access to free bus travel would significantly boost their independence help they build social connection and develop crucial life skill as one individual put it we normal young people who therefore can afford taxi can fit in ubers but still have social need if you want we to be able to integrate and contribute economically we need the opportunity to build social capital and skill while bus travel be by no mean perfect it remain the most consistent and accessible option for many disabled people it do not require pre book and offer regular service and allow for great independence in contrast other mode of transport be much less accessible one constituent share how they have miss train because pre book assistance fail to show up be unable to use underground or metro system which be cite as common issue and struggle to find accessible taxi especially outside major town and in rural area that experience be not an exception it be reflection of the systemic gap in our transport network which fail to accommodate disabled passenger reliably and fairly the royal national institute of blind people have highlight that for those with sight loss bus travel be often the only accessible option pavement parking dangerous scooter driving and inaccessible crossing all make transport on foot far too difficult some of respondent to its recent research say that they use bus at least monthly it be therefore clear that if we be to restrict concessionary access to bus we must first ensure that alternative mode of transport be truly accessible and affordable something that as my constituent experience make clear be far from be the case today at time when disabled people face extra burden and cut from every angle we must find way to support our disabled community the current cost of living crisis have have disproportionate impact on disabled people they be more likely to face fuel poverty skip meal and struggle with rise cost across the board disabled household be also more likely to be among the poor in society with around third of adult in the low income household live with disability scope recently publish its disability price tag report which demonstrate that disabled household need on average an additional month to have the same standard of living as non disabled household these be not luxury but necessity for daily life whether medical equipment high energy bill or accessible transport they be unavoidable cost one of the crucial benefit of remove the am restriction would be to significantly improve access to employment education and training much of which begin before am motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now wakeford many of those opportunity start before am disabled people can still board bus early if they pay but we have just establish that disabled people already face much high daily living cost those on low or no income be therefore disproportionately affect by this decision and their opportunity impact that financial barrier make travel during peak hour burden that many can not afford limit their opportunity before they have even begin the day bernie blind bus user live in one of the few area with concessionary travel describe that access as lifeline live rurally he rely on bus from as early as be to get to work and say it would be near impossible without free travel there be unique challenge face by disabled people that many without that live experience find hard to understand for example as blind person bernie feel at risk count money on the roadside similarly another respondent with vision and hearing loss say her condition worsen later in the day make early travel essential yet in her village the first concessionary service do not arrive until after am those example highlight why disabled people need consistent unrestricted access to transport and why postcode lottery simply do not work and be not fair the previous government approach to support disabled people amount to patchwork of short term fix and empty promise the current government rhetoric on personal independence payment although that have change recently and disability support continue to fall short if the recent wave of dissent from government back benchers over these issue be not evidence enough of the need for urgent change be not sure what be the government have make it clear that they want to encourage disabled people into work the minister here have perfect opportunity to dismantle one of the many barrier they face urge he to do that the solution here be not just achievable it be affordable research by whizz kidz suggest that remove time restriction would cost million reflect only of the annual spend on concessionary travel across england that do not even include companion pass if we be serious about improve opportunity for disabled people the government have say repeatedly they be then this be logical low cost place to start it be matter of fairness and equality have be wait with bated breath to see if the hon gentleman would come on to companion bus pass thank he for the leadership he have show on this issue and for co tabling with the hon member for york central rachael maskell and for epsom and ewell helen maguire and the inimitable hon member for strangford jim shannon who sadly be on his way to northern ireland this evening early day motion specifically on companion bus pass for the disabled this be where disabled person can not use bus alone we have the strange situation where in two third of authority his or her disabled bus pass be allow to cover companion to go with they but in one third of local authority it be not can not think of anything more futile than give free pass to somebody to use bus service which they can not use without companion for whom they have to pay thank the right hon gentleman for that intervention he speak very eloquently on situation that agree be entirely futile we should not give people companion bus pass which be to all intent and purpose useless that be fair place to start as part of this issue we need to do more to ensure that people who require bus companion have access to the service they deserve anticipate that the minister be likely to inform that this be matter to discuss with local transport authority which have discretionary power to offer free travel at peak time yet we must confront the reality that local decision making alone be not deliver fairness for disabled bus user across the country commend east sussex council which have use bus service improvement plan fund to extend concessionary travel to disabled people throughout the day similarly the greater manchester combined authority have announce pilot to offer round the clock free bus travel to old and disabled people hope that colleague across the country but especially the mayor of york and north yorkshire will follow suit let we be clear however that be temporary solution without national leadership and ringfence funding specifically for disabled travel concession we can not expect consistent provision across the country despite previous recommendation for local authority to fund discretionary change to the restriction through fund such as the bsip the reality be that many simply can not afford to thank my hon friend for secure this debate which be real opportunity to discuss bsip one problem with bsip be that they run for short period individual struggle to make decision about where to live whether to purchase car or about invest in an alternative for mobility over long time they think what if the bus situation change in year the bsip cover short period and people do not have stability from an equality point of view permanent decision on that would be helpful thank my hon friend for that excellent point she have steal the next line from my speech but shall forgive she on this occasion wonder whether she be read over my shoulder bsip funding be allocate only on year by year basis offer no long term security or reassurance for disabled people who be affect by these restriction even where local authority be willing to fund all day concession the lack of guarantee ringfenced support mean that provision be patchy at well in east sussex only of bsip fund be need to cover the reimbursement of offer full time concessionary travel for disabled people modest figure with significant impact that show clearly that the issue be not necessarily one of affordability but of political will and prioritisation we can take york and north yorkshire combine authority the local transport authority for my constituency as an example of the million allocate to the region funding have be direct toward valuable but highly localise initiative bus station upgrade and improvement in skipton whitby selby and malton bus stop improvement in helmsley easingwold and leyburn and discount family travel in york city centre those be all worthwhile investment but they offer no benefit to constituent who require access with disabled bus pass especially those live with disability who remain exclude because of outdated restriction do not want patchwork solution that fix the problem only in my area but one that will apply across england and bring everyone forward sadly it be equally clear that where budget be stretch discretionary travel arrangement be the first thing to be scale back to cut cost recent datum from local government association have highlight the million gap in government funding for the concessionary travel scheme it be therefore not likely that local authority will be able to fund enhancement themselves when government funding be already fall short of the require amount hampshire county council recently move in the wrong direction in the light of funding shortfall and budget constraint by remove their discretionary service include free peak time travel for those with companion pass that send worrying message we can not rely on local authority alone to deliver change leadership must come from this place and central government the government can not continue to wash their hand of responsibility by frame this as matter solely for devolution and local transport authority the simple truth be this it be the government who introduce time restriction under the english national concessionary travel scheme and it be the government who hold the power to remove those restriction national problem require national solution if we be serious about build fair and more inclusive society the government must stop kick the can down the road and start act with the urgency and authority that this issue deserve urge the minister to reflect not just on the policy but on the people affect by it this be not about politic it be about fairness dignity and equality of access the barrier face disabled people be already too high let we not allow bureaucratic time restriction to be one of they end this arbitrary time would promote independence reduce social isolation and help disabled people into work education and healthcare the power to change that lie with the government urge the minister and his colleague to act now lift the restriction and help to build transport system that truly work for everyone congratulate the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon on secure the debate and provide the opportunity to discuss disabled bus pass and thank other member for their contribution appreciate the concern that the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough have raise the government know the value of the english national concessionary travel scheme or enct we want everyone to have straightforward access to high quality public transport and be commit to improve service so that they be more inclusive and enable disabled people to travel safely confidently and with dignity know however that disabled people continue to face unacceptable barrier in their everyday use of public transport and we be determined to address they be committed to work with the sector to drive forward these much need improvement regard the specific concern raise about concessionary bus travel let first remind members of the statutory obligation of the enct the scheme provide free bus travel to those with eligible disability and those of state pension age currently between am and pm on weekday and all day on weekend and bank holiday however local authority in england have the power to offer concession in addition to their statutory obligation for example by extend the time of use the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough pre empte say the follow department statistic report that of travel concession authority offer extension to the beginning of the statutory time period allow passholder to travel before be on weekday local authority can also offer companion pass to disabled passenger as discretionary enhancement power we have see take up by two third or of authority from durham to devon indeed york and north yorkshire combine authority go above and beyond the enct on time and companion pass the minister think have concede key point he have admit that some duty be discretionary to council and some be statutory the point about companion bus pass for those disabled people who can not use bus without companion be as early day motion make abundantly clear that inclusion of the free companion bus pass should be statutory specifically for those disabled people who can not use their bus pass without companion there be nothing discretionary about that they simply can not use the bus pass without the companion therefore it should be part of the same statutory element by which they get the free bus pass in the first place thank the right hon member for his extensive intervention every single local transport authority in the country have the ability to go above and beyond the enct in fact every single local transport authority under this government have receive funding to support bus unlike the previous government who offer hunger competition we have do it by fair formula the department conduct review of the enct in which many of the important issue discuss today concern scheme eligibility and travel time be consider will not prejudge the outcome of the review but want to reassure member that accessibility and affordability remain central in our commitment to improve bus service for those who rely on they most as we be all aware we face particularly difficult fiscal climate and fiscal inheritance the encts be vital in support local bus travel assist with access to essential local service and help those who use it to stay active and avoid isolation and we must ensure that it remain financially sustainable the enct cost around million annually and any change to the statutory obligation would therefore need to be carefully consider in term of the impact on financial sustainability more widely this government be commit to improve bus service across the country the bus services no bill which we introduce in december put the power over local bus service back in the hand of local leader right across england and be intend to ensure bus service reflect the need of the community that rely on they it make sense for bus service to reflect local need but whether someone have disability and need to use bus be not locally determined thing there should be fair access to these service wherever someone live in the country currently we have postcode lottery regard the ability to use bus pass hour day the point of the debate be to ask that it be organise nationally so that there be fair access and every disabled person bus pass can be use at any time of day and there be not some part of the country where it work and other where it do not recognise what the hon member be say and will go on to outline some of the other area where the government be help improve accessibility be central to our mission the bill will help we to deliver safe more reliable and more accessible network it include specific measure to make bus travel more accessible and inclusive include through more consistent approach to the inclusive design of bus station and stop the bill will also require local authority to produce bus network accessibility plan assess the exist accessibility of bus network in their area and identify action that they will take to improve they far the voice of disabled people will be at the heart of these reform we will develop bus stop guidance collaboratively with organisation that represent disabled people and local authority will be require to consult disabled people and organisation represent they when make significant change to their bus network in addition the government have commit to publish an integrate national transport strategy this year which will set the long term vision for transport in england key part of the strategy will be to create the condition for transport system that work together to deliver for its user and that make it easy for people to get around everyone should be able to access real time information and simplify integrate ticketing and we have be explore those theme as part of our policy development will the minister give way will the minister give way do not hear who call out first but will give way to the hon member for mid sussex alison bennett thank the minister for give way and my hon friend the member for mid dorset and north poole vikki slade for let take the floor be pleased that the minister have outline the forthcoming integrate transport strategy over month ago wivelsfield railway station in my constituency be allocate funding to make both platform step free that still have not happen we be still wait for an update and wonder whether the minister could ask the department to provide one under the previous government up to station be fund with feasibility study under the access for all programme do not know whether the hon member station be part of that but be happy to take up that subject outside the chamber we also know that these plan will be back up with funding that be why the budget allocate more than billion to local bus service for include million for york and north yorkshire combine authority funding allocate to local authority to improve bus service can be use to fund discretionary enhancement to the enct and we have reaffirm our commitment through the funding allocate as part of the spending review be very grateful to the minister for give way again be incredibly bother by the issue of consistency disabled driver can use their blue badge at any time of the day but somebody who be not able to drive be restrict to be able to use their bus pass only after am that seem to be simple unfairness in the system for people who do not have the option to drive we have an opportunity to make tiny change that would make massive difference reiterate that every single local transport authority in the country have the ability to go above and beyond on that point will the minister give way will not give way again to the hon lady every single local transport authority in the country have the ability to go above and beyond the encts statutory obligation every single local transport authority have be give money to improve bus service and that can be use to top up the statutory provision reiterate that the department have conduct review of the enct and many of the issue raise today be include in that review will not prejudge the outcome but say to hon member once again that accessibility be central to it thank the minister for give way hope he note that be quite measure in my speech and genuinely believe that he want to put disabled people at the heart of the review when the department look at the impact on the financial and on spending will it look at how if disabled people can get to hospital appointment opportunity in education and out spend their money in our economy that might feed into fund the system as mention early under the bus service bill local authority will be task with produce bus network accessibility plan assess bus network in their area and identify action that they will need to take to improve access through the bus grant local transport authority can put in place mitigation to improve the accessibility frequency and reliability of bus in their area thank hon member for their contribution particularly the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough for take the time to raise this matter be sure we will have many more conversation about this and applaud his persistence on the issue hope this response assure hon member that this government be commit to work with local leader and bus operator to help deliver well more reliable and affordable bus service for passenger question put and agree to house adjourn
