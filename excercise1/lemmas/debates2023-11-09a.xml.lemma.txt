think the climate change committee be actually say that its most ambitious scenario which we should be aim for be for we to cut the use of gas by be we go to carry on use north sea oil and gas the question for the hon gentleman and for the whole house be this do we choose for the future to carry on drill every last drop that be the government policy in contravention of all the scientific advice which be that we will end up in world need billion of pound of taxpayer subsidy to bring about that investment through persuasion and divert investment from the private sector personally do not think that that be the right choice the lesson of this crisis be one that the government should have learn and one that other country around the world have learn the only way to get energy security be to sprint for clean power that be why the government onshore wind ban be such disaster that be why their offshore wind auction be such disaster that be why their energy efficiency failure be such disaster this bill neither protect we on price nor give we energy security here be the thing the bill be not motivate by million of people lie awake at night worry about the cost of living crisis it be motivate by prime minister lie awake at night worry about the conservative party crisis the interesting thing be that this bill be plan well before the right hon member for east surrey claire coutinho become energy secretary it be the last desperate throw of the dice by what we might call the no galaxy brain to use climate change as what they call wedge issue they say this to the newspaper all the time series of this new strategy be air in september when the party of churchill and thatcher become the peddler of wacky conspiracy theory they find on the internet abolish the mythical seven bin end the imaginary threat of compulsory car sharing say no to invent conspiracy theory on minute city and fight the fictional meat tax and now we have sequel no long few throw away conspiracy theory this be now the central strategy of their legislative programme member should not take my word for it it be what the prime minister adviser brief to the paper day after day one paper read on monday report that the prime minister want to weaponise climate change as wedge issue where the british people see an energy crisis force up their bill the government see wedge issue where the british people ask how they can have liveable town and city with good transport the government see wedge issue where the british people worry about the effect of the climate crisis on their kid and grandkid the government see wedge issue the point be that the government can not really deny it because they know this be what they be say every day we think there be big opportunity for the conservative party to try to create division on climate change that be why the prime minister use word like eco zealot it be all very transparent they be lock in the boot of strategy whether they agree with it or not that be what be happen certainly and will come on to just how much funding have be make available draw the hon gentleman attention to the national lottery heritage fund which have provide million recently to couple of project moreover the department for levelling up housing and communities through levelling up funding have provide more than million to another couple of project that be perhaps an area that my hon friend could also look into know very well that he have previously be incredibly successful in secure level up funding as champion of the morecambe eden project understand that billion have be raise through the levelling up project in his area so be well aware of his capability in that field in response to the hon member for reading east matt rodda let say that would be delighted to look into funding opportunity specifically around access will write to he about that because be not familiar with what might be available at this time on the wide funding for canal and inland waterway we know because my hon friend have just explain how important these national heritage asset be provide many public benefit be also fully aware of how important it be to have access to water and green space for our physical health and mental wellbeing not to mention the benefit that they provide for nature those benefit be set out in our environmental improvement plan halt the decline of nature by and increase its abundance thereafter be the apex priority follow the environment act canal and waterway river lake coastal area and stream be fundamental to that people enjoy be by canal and waterway and use they for leisure and recreation as well as in the case of canal for their historical value they form an important part of our natural environment by provide the green corridor along which biodiversity can flourish as well as contribute to the growth of local economy such as through domestic tourism the canal river trust report that there be nearly million visit to its canal last year many of which be repeat visit with around million individual user each month that give we real sense of the scale and popularity of our canal pay tribute to the canal river trust for the work that it do day in day out to look after the network our navigation authority have an important role to play into the future as well because they will make sure that our nation key infrastructure be resilient to climate change as we have set out in our national adaptation plan of how we will mitigate and adapt to the risk set out by climate change committee these waterway may suffer the consequence of climate change more than other importantly the work that the navigation authority do will help we meet our net zero target through sustainable transport and energy generation and help to achieve water security through flood mitigation measure and water transfer will write to my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale with the specific of any funding analysis that have be do as say be not the minister responsible for inland waterway but will take the time to write detailed analysis if can may require further information from the volunteer and the partnership that he mention the canal river trust and the environment agency be the two body that receive direct funding and it be important to be clear that we will continue to provide significant funding the canal river trust be set up in as charity independent of government the idea be to replace the publicly own british waterways and free it from public spending constraint the trust own and manage network of some mile of canal and river in england and wales the original endowment in be million but it be now worth billion from million be propose to be grant over year period we will continue to support the canal river trust but we certainly encourage it to work with other to make the most of the commercial opportunity as well now that the trust be free of public sector financing constraint it can source alternative revenue stream include charitable donation and legacy charity tax relief third party project funding and borrowing on the financial market while continue to receive substantial government grant the trust be also endow by the government with significant property and investment portfolio from british waterways as say it be originally worth million and be now worth over billion that be the result of sound investment management by the trust to provide further support and financial certainty for the trust while it be become establish the government agree in to provide year grant of around million an important part of the transfer from british waterways be the memorandum of understanding sign by the department for environment food and rural affairs and the trust which contain clear objective that the trust would progressively move towards great self sufficiency and reduced reliance on public funding through its billion property and investment portfolio and freedom from public sector financial constraint follow government review of current grant funding that be announce in july this year further substantial grant funding package have be announce that will provide million across the year period from importantly that will bring the total amount of government support for the trust to around billion since also want to discuss the funding for the environment agency as mention there be two body that look after the network of canal and river the environment agency mile of navigation be fund in the form of an annual grant in aid for the three year period from to that amount to million hope have set out that this government really have support canal and river whether through the canal river trust or the environment agency but that there be other way in which those organisation can bring in additional funding as we have hear to focus on the project that my hon friend be progress which be the most important thing can not commend too highly the volunteer and their ambition for their area the project have such importance for the local community because it will not only bring back something that be last use in but will bring benefit such as tackle climate change improve people physical and mental wellbeing and support biodiversity that be absolutely what we should be do it support the target of the environmental improvement plan and the work of group such as sustrans public right of way and national trail we all recognise the benefit of be near water and appreciate nature and goodness we all need to get little bit more active confirm that will write to my hon friend with the detailed analysis of the funding for the project so far and will take look at other funding stream as well most importantly look forward to visit he perhaps in kendal to congratulate the volunteer on their hard work and success to date it be brilliant to end today sit with some wonderful good news about really successful big society mission question put and agree to house adjourn
