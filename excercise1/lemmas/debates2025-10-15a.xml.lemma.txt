oral answers to questions northern ireland the secretary of state be ask northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act the legacy act be reject by our domestic court as well as by victim and survivor across northern ireland not least because it propose give immunity from prosecution for the most appalling terrorist crime any incoming government would have have to fix this mess and that be what this government be seek to do with the northern ireland troubles bill which we publish yesterday thank the secretary of state for his answer and for his remark in yesterday statement about the professionalism bravery and sacrifice of our armed force and veteran include those who live in my constituency of basingstoke in their role in northern ireland across the uk and abroad what discussion have he have with veteran the defence secretary and the minister for veterans and people on the new provision and protection in the new legislation have have many such discussion as indicate in my statement to the house yesterday and those have inform the package of veteran protection contain in the bill which the government have set out when the unlawful legacy act shut down investigation into the death of british soldier people across the country include in my constituency will have think that be desperately unfair and not just on those individual but on the family and victim can the secretary of state assure and my constituent that under the new legacy act there will be opportunity for those victim finally to get the justice they deserve there certainly will because with the commission as it be now and with the commission as it will be reform by the trouble bill any incident relate to the trouble anywhere in the united kingdom can be refer into the commission the coach bombing the kingsmill massacre and the warrenpoint massacre be all currently the subject of investigation by the commission many family be desperate for answer about what happen to their love one that be often not about want to take legal action they just want to know under this new bill how quickly will that be deliver for those family how quickly will they get the information that they have wait decade to receive know from my discussion with the commission that it be work hard with the or so case that it be already deal with to go through that process and start produce report for family we know that many family have decide not to engage with the commission because they object to the legacy act and in particular to the immunity it be propose to give that be why we be remove that encourage more family to come forward because know that the commission and its staff be determined to try to provide the answer that those family seek the secretary of state allegation about the legacy act rest on fiction that the labour government have not already hand out amnesty to all those terrorist killer two fact need to be put in front of the house one be from the good friday agreement which put in place mechanism to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of prisoner convict of scheduled offence that be one half of the amnesty the other half be the comfort letter and the right place to look there be the judge rule in the downey case which shoot down any future prosecution the judge say will read it carefully that there be public interest in hold official of the state to promise they have make in full understanding of what be involve in the bargain hence have conclude that this be one of those rare case in which in the particular circumstance it offend the court sense of justice and propriety to be ask to try the defendant in other word it be an amnesty whether the government like it or not on the first issue that the right hon gentleman raise for anyone who be serve sentence for trouble relate offence part of the good friday agreement be that they be release after two year the people of northern ireland vote for that by about it be part of the agreement on his second point there be specific issue in the case of mr downey because he have be give letter that say he be not want when in fact he be that be why that prosecution could not proceed the right hon gentleman point be undermine by the fact that mr downey this be matter of public record be currently face prosecution for two count of murder in it therefore can not be the case that any letter he receive give he an amnesty call the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee number of the core provision of the previous government legacy act have be deem by the northern ireland court to be incompatible with our human right obligation do the secretary of state agree that it be little wonder that the legislation be so widely opposed and do this not make the task of repeal and replace it even more important it certainly do make it more important because it be piece of legislation that have not work and do not command support in northern ireland if legislation be pass in this house that do not command support in northern ireland how on earth can we expect the answer that family be seek which the right hon member for skipton and ripon sir julian smith refer to moment ago to be provide we have responsibility to give more people in northern ireland confidence in the new arrangement so that they will come forward to get the answer they have be seek the secretary of state have do much to talk up the alleged special provision in relation to ex servicemen but legally be it not the case that any such provision would have to apply across the board if be wrong about that will the secretary of state now tell the house which special provision apply exclusively and only to serviceman the provision that apply exclusively and only to service personnel be first the arrangement to prevent cold calling protocol will be agree with the commission in relation to that and secondly not be require to rehearse the history when the ministry of defence would be perfectly capable of provide that information the hon and learn gentleman be distinguished lawyer will know that in respect to other arrangement for witness the law require that they be available to all witness many family have be struggle and campaign for year for truth and justice and they be now hopeful that we can get to the truth we know that admit only few month ago that it have not give all of the file over to operation kenova be also aware that there be many northern ireland office and mod file that have not yet go through the freedom of information process and be therefore not available to the national archives will the secretary of state commit today to ensure that those file be available to the new legacy commission the legacy commission have the right to receive all information that it require to do its job we be propose in the legislation to amend the arrangement for disclosure to require the secretary of state to conduct balance exercise which be not in the previous act and to require the secretary of state to give reason in line with standard that apply across the uk in addition any decision of the secretary of state be open to be judicially review those be important change that hope will give people in northern ireland great confidence the secretary of state say yesterday that his new legacy commission will not relitigate previous investigation involve veteran unless there be compelling reason to do so that be reinforce in clause of the bill that have now be publish to remove scope from opportunistic lawyer would he consider define far more closely than he have do up to this point precisely what he mean by compelling reason that be no doubt an issue that the house will discuss as the bill be consider in detail think that compelling and essential be pretty high bar it will be for the commission to interpret that but no doubt we will continue to discuss it call the liberal democrat spokesperson far to the secretary of state comment on the adequacy of the legacy and reconciliation act would like to turn to the role of the european convention on human right as he will be aware the leader of the opposition seem more interested in the view of the member for mar lago and moscow than the vision of her predecessor winston churchill and be now call for withdrawal from the echr may therefore ask the secretary of state what assessment his department have make as to the effect that cease to be signatory of the convention would have on the good friday agreement the windsor protocol the new legacy framework and northern ireland institution in general the government be absolutely committed to the european convention on human right very much regret that the current opposition have move away from that historic support which go right back to winston churchill as the hon member have set out it be highly irresponsible to suggest pick away at one of the essential foundation of the good friday agreement yesterday in an atypical fit of pique the secretary of state fail to answer my question as to whether the attorney general lord hermer have be exclude from the legislation or have personally recuse himself so today have an easy question give that the secretary of state yesterday highlight the protection for veteran in this legislation could he tell the house which page which clause or which line use the word veteran the clause that would implement the protection in relation to veteran and other be clause and hear hear labour members may cheer but not one of those clause refer to veteran those be not protection for veteran they be protection for everyone paragraph of the explanatory note show that what be say be true and many of they be already available in the criminal justice system it be mirage to be collegiate the secretary of state have spend many year criticise the legacy act of and previous effort on the basis that they command no political support whatsoever across the party of northern ireland if there be agreement across northern ireland members of parliament on amendment during the passage of his legislation will he agree to those amendment the right hon gentleman invite to speculate on amendment that have not yet see as indicate to the house yesterday want to work in as collegiate way as possible in try to take the legislation through in respect to the first part of his question however would say that the only reason the protection and clause just read out be in the bill be because of the government determination to treat our veteran fairly intertrade uk what step he be take to ensure that intertrade uk operate independently and transparently as part of safeguard the union intertrade uk be establish to advise on and promote trade and investment across the uk the term of reference and work programme be publish on the nio provide secretariat support but intertrade uk be free to submit advice and recommendation to the government as it see fit what indicator be the secretary of state use to measure growth in trade within the uk internal market will he commit to publicise an independent assessment of the barrier that the northern ireland protocol be have on trade within the uk and northern ireland which believe affect the ability of intertrade uk to fully promote trade within the uk and operate independently as the hon gentleman will be aware range of organisation include intertrade uk be look at the impact of the windsor framework we have recently have lord murphy report for example which the government be commit to publishing the house of lords northern ireland affairs committee publish report on the same subject only this morning do the secretary of state agree that one of the major deterrent to investment and growth in northern ireland be the absence month after the restoration of stormont of publish investment strategy from the executive with any sort of road map for investor or business on the infrastructure road and housing development that the executive will invest in do he agree that in the absence of that strategy we be fly blind in investment term have he have any discussion with the executive about that like my hon friend look forward to see the investment strategy publish northern ireland have great opportunity under the windsor framework because of the dual market access which no other part of the united kingdom have for those look to invest to trade with both the uk and the european union there be no well place to come and do that but northern ireland defence industrial strategy what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the defence industrial strategy on northern ireland what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the defence industrial strategy on northern ireland in this role be committed to support all people across northern ireland from its business to its community group there be much to champion will do all that can to build on the excellent work of my predecessor my hon friend the member for putney fleur anderson the defence industrial strategy be great news for northern ireland we be commit to economic growth that people can feel in their pocket and the million allocate to five defence growth deal include one in northern ireland will see its booming defence sector thrive airbus which manufacture satellite in my stevenage constituency will soon integrate the civil aircraft wing business at the historical shorts site in belfast close to where thales test its satellite and produce vital missile for ukraine will the minister work with colleague across government and the northern ireland executive to ensure that the defence industrial strategy be complement by the industrial strategy advanced manufacturing sector plan so as to maximise skill innovation and growth my hon friend be right to highlight the rich expertise in northern ireland defence sector which bring benefit right across the uk include to stevenage assure he that the secretary of state and will work across government and with the executive to ensure join up approach that benefit northern ireland be incredibly proud of our naval engineering history in the black country include at company such as somers forge in halesowen and brooks forgings in cradley heath be delighted that this labour government be increase defence spending to level never see under the previous government do the minister agree that that investment in northern ireland at place such as harland wolff will not just benefit the local economy there but the supply chain all across the country my hon friend be right warmly welcome this investment and know he be rightly proud of the defence expertise in his constituency back by this labour government increase defence spending to harland wolff be build the next generation of support ship for our royal navy we be safeguard job skill and our future security welcome both the minister to his place and the defence growth deal do he agree that he now need to work with the northern ireland executive to ensure that the supply chain in northern ireland extend beyond harland wolff and the great belfast area so that everyone in northern ireland can benefit from what be potentially life change development for industry there thank the hon gentleman for his warm word he be right that we need to work across northern ireland to ensure that the life change investment he mention be feel throughout and will make sure that happen may welcome the minister to his place as well will he ensure that there be that co work across the northern ireland executive and the ministry of defence with regard to the executive investment strategy which be also integral to the defence industrial strategy and that the nie will work to remove any blockage that would prevent the two be merge thank the hon gentleman for his warm word will meet executive ministers in northern ireland next week to discuss this and other matter will ensure that we remove any blockage that we can and that we do so by work together northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act replacement what step he be take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act what step he be take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act what step he be take to replace the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act the government be commit to repeal and replace the legacy act with new arrangement that seek to command great confidence in northern ireland yesterday we publish the northern ireland troubles bill and draft remedial order to do just that yesterday the secretary of state announce this labour government new northern ireland troubles bill despite all the justification for the bill it still mean one thing veteran many of whom be elderly be drag back through the court do the secretary of state think that be an acceptable way to treat those people who bravely serve and defend our country the hon gentleman say drag back to court the only circumstance in which veteran or anyone else appear in court be if they be charge with an offence he will know perfectly well what the figure show about prosecution in the year since the good friday agreement here we be talk about coroner inquest small number will be restart because they be already in train and be stop by the last legacy act the rest will go into the sifting process govern by the solicitor general we think that we have fair and reasonable framework that we will put in place to ensure that veteran be protect and properly look after on september the prime minister assure the bbc that veteran would receive protection not afford to paramilitary so can the secretary of state confirm which of the statutory protection will apply solely to veteran or be it the case that they will also extend to paramilitary will give the hon gentleman one example which involve the representation of veteran on the statutory advisory group that will be establish draw on the experience of operation kenova allow the voice of veteran to be hear this will be cover by clause of the legislation one of the concern around drag veteran through lawfare and our court be the effect on army recruitment so what be the secretary of state reaction to colonel nick kitson the son of general sir frank kitson say how can anyone volunteer to put their life on the line for government indeed nation that do not have their back meet many cadet who be very keen to join the armed force and we should pay tribute to all who be offer their service to the nation in defence of the realm we should not talk down the importance of that recruitment effort if anybody look in the round at what we be put forward they will think it be reasonable have meet many veteran who argue as the veterans commissioners have say that they be not look for immunity under the law which be what the legacy act give they be look for fairness under it and that be what we will provide do my right hon friend agree that people who join the british army not only recognise that they have to abide by the law but expect the government to have their back and offer they that fairness can he offer an assurance that people who serve in northern ireland will be give the fairness that they expect and that this be government that genuinely have their back be happy to give my hon friend that assurance to take another example of the protection it be put to we by veteran in our discussion that no veteran should have to return to northern ireland to engage with legacy process and we be legislate for that in the bill call the shadow secretary of state this morning unusually congratulate the government on have admit terrible mistake early this year we on this side of the house vote against labour draft remedial order which would have allow gerry adams to sue the taxpayer so we welcome the fact that labour amend that order yesterday but the question remain why do it ever bring forward such ridiculous policy in the first place hope that the hon gentleman will not only offer congratulation but continue these discussion about legacy matter in that spirit when say be prepared to listen mean it would just point out to he that the problem arise because of the supreme court judgment as he be well aware and that for just over two year the last government could not find solution the one that be put in place do not work because it be find to be incompatible have reflect on the point that be make in representation and this decision will ensure that there be no gap as it have be refer to we have find mechanism that we believe will achieve what section and fail to do invite the secretary of state to look at his own legislation because clause and be markedly similar to the section that we leave he we on this side of the house may have win the battle over this but we still have not win the war to protect our veteran from vexatious complaint be it not the truth that if it have not be for month of campaigning by the conservatives the shadow defence team the medium and report from policy exchange which may now have save the taxpayer hundred of million of pound labour would have stick to its plan and allow mr adams and his comrade to sue anyway indicate to the house some month ago that we be determined to find mean of deal with the supreme court judgment in on the subject of the carltona principle that be what our propose legislation will seek to remedy we think it be well formulation than section and and look forward to the hon gentleman support in pass it uk internal market what step he be take to maintain northern ireland place in the uk internal market the government be commit to safeguard northern ireland place in the uk internal market and to implement the windsor framework in good faith the internal market scheme enable trader to move good from great britain into northern ireland tariff free and since may with significantly reduce paperwork and check it be disgrace that the safeguard the union provision severely restrict trade between great britain and northern ireland bind the province to area of eu law over which the people have no say will the secretary of state take step to remove what be leave of this damaging international trade border within our own nation and restore the birthright of the people of northern ireland as equal citizen of this united kingdom say to the hon gentleman and those who advocate that we should leave the european union this be the consequence of it there be an open border and two different jurisdiction how be we go to deal with trade in those circumstance secondly the good be flow the good be move look at the evidence the northern ireland economy in the second quarter grow by that be not indicative of problem call the shadow minister on november last year the health secretary assure this house that the tobacco and vapes bill will apply in northern ireland the secretary of state will know that the age base sale ban affect the placement of tobacco product on the market and so be potentially in breach of the eu tobacco product directive so can the secretary of state repeat the health secretary assurance and also tell we whether the government have confirm with the european union that the ban will stand in northern ireland it be certainly the government intention that the ban will apply in northern ireland because it be very important that young people all over the united kingdom be protect in the way in which the bill seek speaker statement before we come to prime minister question welcome to the gallery the honourable speaker of the parliament of the republic of fiji and the chairman of the parliament of ukraine member will also know that today mark the fourth anniversary of the death of our friend and colleague sir david amess who be murder in his southend west constituency in sir david

prosecution mr speaker know just how seriously rightly that you take these matter national security will always be the first priority of this government and we will always defend against espionage in recent week baseless accusation have be put about by the party opposite let set out the fact the relevant period be when these offence take place that be under the conservative government between the year of and that period be bookende by the integrated review of the beginning of the period and the refresh of that review in set out their policy these statement of government policy be very carefully word to not describe china as an enemy mr stuart somebody who be on the speaker panel and who have tell once before should know well do not question my judgment think it be important that the prime minister tell the house first rather than somewhere else please this be very important to and to the house take it seriously so do not need any more side comment the review of and the refresh of be very carefully word to not describe china as an enemy instead they state that they would increase national security protection where china pose threat and that the then government would engage with china to leave room open for constructive and predictable relation the deputy national security adviser matt collins set out the then government position in substantive witness statement in which be subsequently supplement by two further short statement the cabinet secretary assure that the dnsa faithfully set out the policy of the then tory government know at first hand that the dnsa be civil servant of the utmost integrity and those opposition members who work with he be sure would agree with that assessment under this government no minister or special adviser play any role in the provision of evidence can not say what the position be of the previous government in relation to the involvement of ministers or special adviser if the leader of the opposition know the answer to that question and suspect that she do invite she to update the house last night the crown prosecution service clarify that in its view the decision whether to publish the witness statement of the dnsa be for the government therefore carefully consider this question this morning and after legal advice have decide to publish the witness statement give the information contain we will conduct short process but want to make it clear that intend to publish the witness statement in full to be clear have the conservatives be quick in update our legislation review that start in these individual could have be prosecute and we would not be where we be now be happy to answer any question on this this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house shall have further such meeting later today last week visit rayner world lead provider of cataract solution base in worthing winner of this year king award for enterprise for innovation and fantastic employer of local apprentice welcome the government ambition to get two third of our young people into an apprenticeship further education or university what will the prime minister do to ensure that every young person in east worthing and shoreham have the skill they need to thrive we want country where young people be support where the quality of teaching be raise and where every skilled apprentice be value and respect we have set new target of two third of young people to be in an apprenticeship or university that will smash the glass ceiling and renew our country we have support this with record billion budget for more apprenticeship more technical college and guarantee training apprenticeship or work for all to year old call the leader of the opposition mr speaker thank you for mark four year since the terrible murder of sir david amess know the whole house will want to join in remember our former colleague he be very much still in our heart and mind the way he die remind we that the security of members and this parliament be paramount so it concern we all that the case against two people spy on member of this house have collapse it be simply unbelievable exactly as expect the prime minister have to be drag out at the top of pmq to give statement that answer no question laughter do know what they be laugh at we be talk about the security of this parliament he have to be drag out only to repeat more obfuscation it be simply unbelievable that he be try to say that the last government do not classify china as threat so will refresh his memory in the previous government integrate review describe china as the big state base threat to the uk economic security in the then minister for security say from the dispatch box that china pose threat but let we leave aside the government in november the director general of classify china as threat in his remark how be it possible that the government fail to provide the evidence that the cps need to prosecute the substantive evidence be provide in by the previous government that be when the witness statement be submit be go to disclose it member will all be able to read it the substantive evidence be write disclose and submit in under the previous government note that the leader of the opposition do not indicate whether ministers be involve in that at the time the leader of the opposition question what be in the refresh review of and let be clear the then foreign secretary the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly who be sit on the opposition front bench give speech at mansion house one month after the arrest it be call our position on china and set out the government policy he say in that speech that sum up china as threat in one word would be impossible impractical and most importantly unwise he be foreign secretary at the time it be not just the right hon member for braintree the leader of the opposition be business secretary at the time in september the relevant year she say we certainly should not be describe china as foe it be worth look up the word foe in the dictionary it do not end there in september she say have shy away from call china threat she be play politic with national security the prime minister can read the beginning of quote but let finish that quote at the end of the quote that he just read out do describe china as threat but his whataboutery neglect the fact that the spy be charge under conservative government and let off under labour the prime minister have not answer any question on monday the security minister repeatedly tell the house that ministers do not take decision and that it be the deputy national security adviser who have full freedom be the government seriously say that only one man the deputy national security adviser have anything to do with this failure be that prime minister seriously say that the deputy do not discuss with the national security adviser the home secretary or anyone in downing street be the prime minister seriously say that yes and let explain why first the case be charge under the last government accord to the evidence submit under that government who set out their policy position what be on issue in the trial be not the position of the current government but the position of the last government they carefully avoid describe china as an enemy because that be their policy at the time as far as the position under this government be concern no minister or special adviser be involve will double check this be important after the charge decision the prosecution be very careful about who would then see the witness evidence will double check exactly what instruction be take but can be absolutely clear that no minister be involve no special adviser be involve in this be as assure as can be that the prosecution be say that it would be the witness only who would be involve in short update to the evidence that be submit under the previous government the end of the answer be different from the beginning of the answer what on earth be the point of we have lawyer rather than leader as the prime minister if he can not even get the law right on matter of national security he keep go back to the cps the cps have say that it be satisfied that it be right to charge in august the sunday times report that jonathan powell the prime minister national security adviser convene secret meeting to discuss the security consequence of the china spy trial do that meeting happen or be the sunday times make it up the right hon lady be clearly not lawyer or leader the problem for she be that do actually understand the law and know what have to be prove have also look at the evidence that be put in under the last government in relation to this case there be meeting in september that do not involve the national security adviser discuss the evidence in any way one further point the final statement in this case be submit in august there be no further submission of evidence one way or the other after any discussion in september this be red herring completely scurrilous allegation make by the leader of the opposition the prime minister have now twice directly contradict the word of his security minister they can not both be right the chair of the foreign affairs committee could not get any answer from the security minister the cps say that it be satisfied that the decision to charge the case in april not august be correct on the basis of where the law stand at that time this be matter of fact not matter of what the previous government have think or of the case not meet legal test it do something must have change when the charge be bring and when the case collapse the charge be bring under the conservatives and collapse under labour will the prime minister tell we what change and what collapse the case have say that will publish the witness statement in full the whole house will then see exactly what be set out in in the substantive witness statement and exactly what be set out in the two supplementary witness statement the right hon lady will then realise that what she have just say be entirely baseless the cps have say in the clear term that this prosecution be drop because this government do not provide the statement it expect why should we believe man who at the last prime minister question say that he have full confidence in the good friend of convict paedophile forgive we if we do not trust word he say this all stink of cover up give his statement early will the prime minister publish today not just the government witness statement but also the meeting minute and all the correspondence that he have with the cps let be clear the only process want to go through be in relation to some of the individual in the statement to make sure that they know that this be come up can assure the house that there be no substantive delay here rise know this be of acute concern to number of people will have the statement out in full there be bit of proper process that need to go through the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat will understand why that be necessary and then they will be publish in full the right hon lady ask about minute etc there be the usual rule and process for government remind she that the substantive issue in this case be discuss at meeting under the previous government so the opposition be ask to disclose the discussion that they have in relation to the witness statement in the first place mr speaker you deserve well and this house deserve well than the evasive answer that we have have from the prime minister even the former cabinet secretary lord butler have accuse the government of be economical with the truth on this issue the prime minister can not tell we why jonathan powell have secret meeting when the security minister say he have no involvement the case he can not tell we why his government do not provide evidence that china be threat and suspect that the statement will not prove that either he be blame his civil servant the medium and the last government he can not explain why he could not see this case through he should have see this case through let be clear about what have happen serious case involve national security have collapse because this government be too weak to stand up to china if the prime minister can not protect the member of this house what do that say about his ability to protect this country the case do not proceed because the policy of the past government do not meet the test that be necessary that be the long and the short of it far from evade have say that will disclose the full witness statement and set out exactly what be in they and exactly what the subsequent statement say the allegation that somehow they be change that the first and second statement be different be completely and utterly unfounded this be pathetic spectacle instead of take responsibility for the fact that they fail to update the law the review into the legislation be in the conservatives take eight year to change the law have they do that more quickly this case would have proceed it be their failure and they be just sling mud meanwhile we be get on with renew our country plan reform to get britain build again online hospital for waiting list and new opportunity for young people labour be build well future the conservatives can not even come to term with their past derby be city on the up but unfortunately this last year we have be devastate by knife crime nasty tory austerity decimate frontline policing and we be now pay the price for that at my regular city centre safety summit the message be clear to turn the page we need action not word can the prime minister update my constituent on the action that this government be take to ensure that all our resident visitor and worker can enjoy our city centre safely my hon friend will have hear at our conference from pooja kanda who have meet number of time her son ronan be fatally stab iusb be proud that we have deliver ronan law to tackle the sale of ninja sword we have also ban zombie knife and strengthen control for online knife sale pay tribute to my hon friend work in set up the city safety summit call the deputy leader of the liberal democrats may associate myself and my party with the tribute to david amess on behalf of my party may also pay tribute to ming campbell who be be lay to rest today that be the reason why my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey can not be here thank you mr speaker the prime minister and other member of this house for the very kind tribute pay yesterday we welcome the new level of transparency from the prime minister and we will scrutinise the witness statement closely but it be clear that there be still many question to be answer include question from hongkonger hongkonger in st albans and across the uk settle in our community after they flee repression at the hand of the chinese state but they now see british government who want to make it hard for they to settle here permanently refuse to impose targeted sanction on chinese official who put bounty on hongkongers head refuse to rule out chinese super embassy and be fail to tackle chinese espionage hongkonger be start to ask whether the prime minister be trade away their security and safety in our community for cosier relationship with beijing what be the prime minister answer to they the answer be no we have give and will continue to give support to hongkongers who need and deserve that support the hon lady will be assure that the jimmy lai case be raise regularly at every opportunity by my ministers and by think hongkonger will require lot more reassurance and action from this government it be not just the chinese government who be threat to our country on monday the far right racist hate preacher tommy robinson who be on trial for allegedly refuse to comply with counter terror police claim that his legal cost be be pay by elon musk it be outrageous that man who have so much control over what people read online every day could be fund someone who stoke far right extremism on our street if it be putin the government would surely act will the prime minister commission the security service to assess the threat that elon musk pose to our democracy and to recommend measure that this house can take to stop that we look across the board at threat to our democracy and must continue to do so will not comment on the particular case give the state of legal proceeding next year mark the anniversary of the battle of the imjin river where the infantry brigade last stand prevent the capture of seoul during the korean war that hill be now call gloster hill as proud testament to the incredible bravery of one of those battalion our glorious glosters will the prime minister join in call for commemoration of the glorious glosters and all those who fight to defend democracy liberty and freedom in south korea join my hon friend in mark the heroism and sacrifice of the infantry brigade which be an endure example of the bravery of all our armed force know that defence ministers would be happy to discuss commemorate their courage our debt to the armed force underlie our commitment to veteran which include deliver home for hero and new network of veteran support centre back with million ahead of his party conference the prime minister tell the bbc that he be not sure whether he would campaign in caerphilly for the by election on october this be an

infrastructure of britain and for the benefit of the leader of the opposition that be spell nowhere be this renewal more clearly need than at the galley hill road in swanscombe in my constituency which collapse more than two year ago and there be no fix in sight do the prime minister agree that the announcement of the transport structure fund in the spending review show that this government be end the conservative decline and get on with fix break road like galley hill my hon friend be right the conservative party let road crumble after year of under investment we be build infrastructure that work people rely on with billion to repair bridge tunnel and flyover across the country and billion in major road and rail upgrade we be rebuild britain the conservatives can not even spell it much like the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth my constituent be serve by the tees esk and wear valleys mental health trust they face travel to york or middlesbrough for local in patient bed with some people be send as far afield as glasgow or southampton this be completely unacceptable and we need provision of local mental health in patient bed welcome the openness to an inquiry into tewv but my concern be that while that be go on we need real action so that the continue failing do not see the loss of any other life what step will the prime minister and the secretary of state take now to reassure our constituent and to rebuild trust in tewv the hon gentleman will have hear my response to my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth moment ago say again that what happen to his constituent be unacceptable and we will give the answer as soon as we can in the meantime the hon member ask what be happen we be get on with recruit additional nhs mental health staff we be build new dedicated mental health emergency department and we have boost nhs spending on mental health by almost million thank the prime minister for his strong word at our party conference in call for unity at time when many feel that our country be divide and in rightly call out racism be second generation immigrant bear in this country and people like and so many of our constituent have every right to be here no one should face hatred because of the colour of their skin do the prime minister agree that some of those on the opposition benches who seek to stoke division and keep close company with those who accept russian bribe can not and should not be trust to govern this country my hon friend capture the choice before we as country we can either give in to division or come together as country and renew our country this be national hate crime awareness week and in the past fortnight we have see the horrific terror atrocity in manchester and despicable arson attack on the mosque in peacehaven want to be clear as prime minister be proud to lead and to serve this beautiful tolerant and diverse country an attack on one of we be an attack on all of we calithea studios in mid dunbartonshire be prime example of business do everything the government ask the owner of this beauty salon and her three employee each earn less than year yet the business will pay the government over for the year in vat employer national insurance and pension contribution do the prime minister think it be fair that the hard work owner who be provide job and training on the high street contribute more to the exchequer than she earn in year do he believe this encourage entrepreneurship which be important for economic growth and local job as the hon lady will know we have protect business rate bill from inflation and extended relief at with new permanent low rate set and introduce for retail hospitality and leisure as part of our small business plan we be provide billion so that lender can offer more loan to small business we be of course introduce the most significant package on late payment real issue for small business and reform that be big than any in the last year can the prime minister update the house on the government election bill do he agree that in the light of recent court case and the conviction of reform former leader in wales no party whose leader take russian bribe can be trust to defend our democracy labour be introduce an election bill to protect our democracy from foreign interference but look at reform the hon member for clacton nigel farage and his deputy the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice work alongside someone who take money to spread putin propaganda whatever their denial they have serious question to answer about what they know but that be the choice kremlin crony sow division or labour patriot work for national renewal the line that we have hear from the government in recent day have be conflation of fabricated story try to set up straw man and knock down thing that have not be say the real question in this whole debate be whether or not the director of public prosecutions charge legally and properly if they do then the official secrets act be valid and all this talk about the national security act which introduce be completely irrelevant if they do not why be he not charge his successor with abuse of power well we know the reality mr speaker although the prime minister have answer the question about evidence the real question be what political direction do this government give to their official before they go to give evidence absolutely none absolutely none will also tell the right hon gentleman this be the chief prosecutor for five year and can say that in those five year which include three year under the coalition government when we be take difficult decision on mps expense not once not once be subject to political pressure of any sort from anyone that be the tradition in this country it be proud tradition and it be one uphold as prime minister just as uphold it when be director of public prosecutions on point of order mr speaker in the statement that the security minister make early this week and then again in answer to question today have be misquote and the misquote think be significant it have be say that in speech at mansion house say that describe china as threat be impossible impractical and most importantly unwise the quote be that describe china or our policy in one word be impossible impractical and most importantly unwise in that speech go on to say of our policy first we will strengthen our national security protection wherever beijing action pose threat to our people or our prosperity finish by say and when there be tension with other objective we will always put our national security first how can get redress for this misquote mr speaker the right hon gentleman have put it on the record and it be there now for all to see will leave it at that jhoots pharmacy urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make statement on the adequacy of jhoots as pharmacy provider congratulate the hon member on secure this important urgent question pharmacy play vital role in our healthcare system they be at the heart of our high street and be the cornerstone of community up and down the country that be why this government have give pharmacy funding boost of almost million this year which be more than any other area of the nhs and the big uplift in year indeed we have provide uplift over the two year period the vast majority of pharmacy provide excellent care to their patient but unfortunately there be some that fall short of the standard we expect sadly the service provide by jhoot be fall well below the mark hon member will know that several integrate care board have be deploy contract management action against jhoots initially in the form of breach notice integrated care board enforce the nhs term of service on pharmacy for such thing as their opening hour and the general pharmaceutical council regulate pharmacy premise and pharmacy professional both icb and the general pharmaceutical council have power to address problem in pharmacy and they be actively use those power include in relation to store that be part of jhoots have write to the hon gentleman about this case as he will understand it be difficult for to go into detail about one pharmacy chain at least on the specific of the measure we be take but can tell he that where there be problem with access to medicine icb be support affected patient in the short term for example by allow local dispense doctor to provide dispense service to those patient where pharmacy store regularly breach their term of service icb can give they notice that they be be remove from the pharmaceutical list this power apply to any and all pharmacy include of course jhoots and mean that pharmacy would no long be able to provide nhs service such notice can be appeal against so it do take some time to work through the system stress to hon member that pharmacy be private business and must be responsible business owner we can regulate what pharmacy should and should not do as part of their nhs term of service but it be not possible to prevent pharmacy from for example not pay their staff in conclusion if pharmacy breach their term of service for example by not be open when they should be or where there be patient safety concern we take action the general pharmaceutical council be take regulatory action icb be take regulatory action and be support patient with access to medicine where necessary this be aim at improve pharmacy behaviour but can ultimately lead to pharmacy be force to close their business have also ask my official to explore whether we can strengthen the regulatory framework to be able to deal more quickly with pharmacy that do not play by the rule my official be work on that as matter of urgency my office be also set up meeting with the hon gentleman to discuss this matter far and will keep the house update in the usual way would be grateful madam deputy speaker if you could pass on my thank to mr speaker for grant this urgent question thank the minister for his response the collapse of service provision in some place the constant closure in other and the general governance at jhoots pharmacy which operate branch across england demand immediate ministerial intervention in west dorset jhoots branch in lyme regis and bridport have be close for month leave thousand without access to essential medication and place huge strain on overstretch neighbouring pharmacy jhoot staff have go month without pay despite payslip be issue tax deduction make and pension contribution not deposit have be contact only this morning by staff who have not be pay for the third month many be unable to buy food or pay rent they be rely on food bank and the amazing community that have step up to support they there have be report of staff recruit by jhoot under skilled worker visa be leave without income or resource have also be make aware of deeply troubling report of control drug be remove without proper documentation or process which if prove true may constitute breach of the misuse of drugs act have raise my concern with the general pharmaceutical council his majesty revenue and customs the nhs business services authority the icb and the minister whom thank for his response understand that process must be follow but this situation require immediate action jhoot staff be not be pay and people across the country do not have access to vital medicine will the minister please confirm what step be be take to ensure that all jhoots staff be pay without delay what discussion have take place with the nhs bsa the general pharmaceutical council and other regulator about jhoots business practice finally will the government commit to urgently review jhoots suitability as an nhs pharmacy provider outline what safeguard will be introduce to prevent this from happen again and review the pharmacy funding model agree with everything the hon gentleman have say it be completely and utterly unacceptable if business such as jhoots be not pay its staff if there be indeed these report that control drug be not be handle properly would strongly recommend that any mishandling of drug be report to the general pharmaceutical council which regulate pharmacy professional and premise so that appropriate action can be take the hon gentleman ask about the payment of staff pharmacy staff be vital part of the nhs part of what pharmacy do pharmacy staff provide vital service to our community and should be pay accord to their contract any failure to do so be completely unacceptable of course pharmacy staff be employ not by the nhs but by the business they work for so any dispute between staff and pharmacy business should be raise with the advisory conciliation and arbitration service acas be also in touch with the pharmacists defence association the pda which be do important work represent its member will be meet they soon as well of course we have responsibility for the nhs part of the work but it be up to individual business to ensure that their employee be treat fairly the hon gentleman rightly mention the review of suitability to operate and we be now look at that across the board we be look at the role of the general pharmaceutical council and what be take place with icb take contract action where there be no sign of improvement and pharmacy continue to be in breach the next escalation be to strike they off the pharmaceutical register which take some time because certain pharmacy be not go to name name but be sure the hon gentleman can imagine who be try every single thing they can to appeal push back and stop the action that we be seek to take which be elongate the process however want to be clear if there be clear breach and action be not take to remedy that breach pharmacy will be strike off the pharmaceutical register call our very own pharmacist sadik al hassan thank you madam deputy speaker as pharmacist for nearly year and the mp of north somerset have the dubious pleasure of have two jhoots pharmacy in the town of portishead in my constituency can not say two operating pharmacy because they have shutter their door with report of they not have pay their bill their rent or their staff as pharmacist know that this affect the perception and view of community pharmacy up and down the country what plan do the minister and the department have to ensure that bad actor in the pharmacy space as jhoots in my opinion appear to be be deal with more quickly and effectively under new legislation order question should not be statement pay tribute to my hon friend direct professional expertise and experience as pharmacist he be right to point to the fact that the regulatory framework be not as strong as it need to be have speak with official in my department who have work in the pharmacy sector for many year and they have never see behaviour like this before it be quite unprecedented nevertheless it be shin light on the fact that we do not have strong enough regulatory framework we need to look at the way that business owner be regulate there be strong regulation of pharmacist and pharmacy staff such as technician but business owner be not regulate as strongly as they could and should be my hon friend be right that speed be also important which be why we need to look at way of fast track particular case where there be clear breach because sometimes the appeal process can be very slow indeed we be look at all of this in the round and have commission urgent advice from my official to see how we can beef up the regulatory framework call the shadow minister only this weekend the national pharmacy association chief executive henry gregg say that he be concerned that report of jhoots pharmacy branch across england fail patient risk damage community pharmacy reputation and could imperil its ability to secure good funding settlement community across the country have be leave without function pharmacy door have be lock without notice patient have arrive to find no pharmacist no prescription and no stock and staff have go unpaid and be threaten with the sack jhoots pharmacy face allegation of not pay wage have premise repossess and serious regulatory breach the general pharmaceutical council have already intervene several time yet for many patient it be too late they simply can not get their medicine this be not an isolated business failure it expose deep fragility in the community pharmacy network on which local people depend for basic and often lifesave care have four question for the minister first when be nhs england first make aware of these closure and have the minister meet the jhoots leadership if not why not if he do what be the outcome secondly have the department assess how many people have be leave without local pharmacy access as result of jhoots action and what be the minister do to remedy this consider it be happen across the country he mention icb but there be several involve thirdly what mechanism exist to ensure continuity of care when contractor collapse or walk away again he mention icb but be there national contingency plan finally will the government now review whether the current model under which chain be expand rapidly through acquisition and debt be fit to safeguard community pharmacy in the long term link to that can the minister definitively confirm that the funding settlement have not be compromise the year nhs plan state that it want to move more care into the community yet it be completely miss delivery chapter on how to achieve that at the same time we have issue such as jhoots hope the minister will be take step to investigate this issue in its entirety and to safeguard against this type of incident happen again and will spell out the delivery aspect of the year plan thank the shadow minister for his question he ask about first awareness of what be happen with jhoots he will be aware that it enter the market through the purchase of number of lloyds pharmacy that be no long go concern in so the question about due diligence on jhoots as an operator be probably something he should be ask one of my predecessor from his party which be in power at the time since those purchase jhoots have expand rapidly and that have be where we have see the question mark around its ability to operate and the serious downgrading of service have not meet the management of jhoots we be look at whole range of legal and regulatory enforcement procedure and the decision we have take be that it be well not to interfere in any way in those process but be certainly monitor that very closely if we receive legal advice that suggest that such meeting would be good idea will of course be open to it however the current legal position base on the advice we have receive be that it would not be appropriate at this time on local pharmacy access integrate care board have statutory responsibility to ensure adequate pharmacy provision some icb for example have allow dispense gp practice to provide dispense service to affected patient while other have work with local gp practice to advise patient to nominate alternative nearby pharmacy for their prescription we have look at the impact geographically and our view be that in most case there be alternative pharmacy provision to jhoots within striking distance however there be four or five area of the country where that be not the case include in the constituency of the hon member for west dorset edward morello who secure this urgent question be very conscious of that in those case extra provision need to be make through icb and gps that may be through distance selling or by other mean to ensure that patient have pharmacy access the shadow minister ask about continuity of care and national contingency the situation be challenging because as mention in my remark and as official have say we have not see this rapid decline in service before we be work at pace to strengthen the regulatory framework and we be look at contingency plan do not see any reason why the overall funding settlement for pharmacy should be undermine we will continue to protect community pharmacy as crucial part of our nhs thank the minister for his response community pharmacy such as lodge pharmacy in perry common in my area play vital role and offer an excellent service and that be why be concern when place such as jhoots pharmacy close or maybe fold the winter month be come and be passionate about winter measure how will we ensure that our pharmacy can offer the winter vaccine need this year if we lose large chain such as jhoots pay tribute to my hon friend work on the select committee nhs england be assess the situation and prepare contingency plan in case jhoots become insolvent such plan involve work with other local pharmacy and dispense gp practice to ensure that patient continue to have access to medicine continuity of care as she rightly point out must be at the heart of our response and we be work at pace to ensure that be protect call the liberal democrat spokesperson may first thank my hon friend the member for west dorset edward morello for raise this appalling issue pharmacy be at the heart of our community and be rely upon by million they be under increase pressure across the country where we be see irregular opening hour and unannounced closure family live in community that rely on jhoots pharmacy such as those in the constituency of my hon friend and many other part of the country will be deeply concerned that they and their loved one could be about to be leave without medicine that they desperately need staff have be place in an intolerable situation the national pharmacy association chief executive have say as we have hear that jhoots risk damage the reputation of community pharmacy the government urgently need to grip this issue and ensure that patient and the staff of these pharmacy be not be let down will the minister and the secretary of state agree to meet all the member in this place whose community be affect by potential closure will he update the house at the early opportunity as to what step he be take to stabilise the crisis in community pharmacy across the country be he confident that integrate care board which be distract by cut to their budget and top down reorganisation have the capacity to deal with this urgent situation as they head into planning for the next winter crisis thank the hon member for those question would certainly be happy to meet member who have jhoots in their constituency and be affect will update the house we be look at strengthen the regulation but there be some constraint on what can say because so much of this be now go through legal process there be pushback and we do not want to do anything to jeopardise the legal action we be take through the appeal process so will have to be relatively circumspect in what say be happy to have those discussion and to update the house be confident that icb can take this forward in most case across the country our assessment be that there be pharmacy within striking distance of jhoots but certainly in those area where there be not that may require particular follow up action my official and will be follow up with those icb to ensure that the appropriate action be be take five member of staff from jhoots pharmacy in laceby road have be to see they have be go into work but they have not be pay since july it be absolutely appalling can the minister set out what pressure he and the department can bring to bear on this chain which have now unfortunately close its door for good agree with absolutely every word that my hon friend have just say it be completely unacceptable that people be come into work do an honest day work and then not receive an honest day pay unfortunately there be limit to what we can do because pharmacy be private business and each employer be require to fulfil their legal obligation to pay their staff recommend that the member of staff she mention contact acas and their trade union the pda if they be not already in touch for those who be not member of that union strongly recommend join trade union and seek legal advice from it that be vital part of what trade union do they need to take action to force jhoots to do the right thing thank my friend and neighbour the hon member for west dorset edward morello for secure this urgent question have exactly the same problem as he and the hon member for north somerset sadik al hassan but in shaftesbury in my constituency thank the staff of boots who be pick up such huge amount of slack because jhoots be not there there be danger to the member of staff who be on duty because there be prescribe drug on the premise and she be the only person there and worry for her safety what additional support can the department give to exist provider such as boots that be pick up the slack particularly during the winter peak in term of advice to patient and administer vaccine this be clear breach of contract but be tell by our icb that it do not fall within contract law the regulation be moot on this point because the circumstance that jhoots find itself in be never envisage when the regulation be write that be the problem that the minister have identify there seem to be some timidity among official and other on the overhang threat of judicial review be the government to act in extremis to introduce some urgency urge the minister to take that risk on behalf of all our constituent certainly welcome his offer follow the suggestion of the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan that all member of parliament with constituent affect by this dire problem should be involve in meeting look forward to that so that we can provide timely advice update and support to our constituent who be rightly worried pay tribute to the boots employee in the hon member constituency where jhoots be not provide the service that be require we appreciate that can assure he that nothing be off the table he have rightly identify the problem with the regulatory framework which be strong on pharmacist pharmacist premise and pharmacy staff but there be something of gap when it come to regulate pharmacy business owner that gap have be identify and have commission my official to work on that at pace will happily keep he update on that work thank the minister for the context and the response he have provide so far jhoot in my constituency of gillingham and rainham have provide an incredibly poor service not pay staff not dispense vital medicine and often not open on time however any replacement pharmacy or provider can not come in because the local pharmaceutical need assessment suggest that there be function provision will the minister consider review of the criterion surround pnas so that they not only list those pharmacy that be available but also look at failure such as the one we be see with jhoot by recognise that other provider can take their place if need be my hon friend have put her finger on an issue within all this which be that if we be look to bring in other pharmacy to replace jhoots or indeed to take over jhoots store we can not do that in the latter case until such time as there be an insolvency and that business be no long go concern there be process set out in legislation for open new pharmacy potential new pharmacy contractor can apply to open in an area and evidence how new pharmacy can provide benefit for patient but it be challenge for they to make such case if jhoots pharmacy be still list as open and provide service it be something of situation we first have to resolve the issue with jhoots and take the necessary action and then we can see where we be with potential gap in the market call the chair of the health and social care committee the case of jhoots be clearly hugely unfortunate give the incredible work that community pharmacy do up and down the country for our constituent be pleased to hear the minister say that this case will not negatively affect the funding settlement but it be set against the backdrop of very precarious sector where actor who want to do good by our community and do high quality job often find that they simply can not make end meet and bad actor find way to move in when the committee look last at this issue the workforce be key plank to why the sector be not sustainable what update can the minister give we on the inclusion of pharmacist in the workforce plan thank the hon lady and pay tribute to her work as chair of the select committee be very proud of the fact that we deliver million uplift to across the two year period it be the high uplift of any sector not just of my portfolio but the entire nhs be also very proud of the fact that we be take forward hub and speak legislation to enable pharmacist and pharmacy technician to operate at the top of their licence the day before yesterday we sign off on statutory instrument to improve the ability of technician to do more in the area of dispense we be look to empower the workforce and enable they to operate at the top of their licence that be fundamental part of the shift from hospital to community that be at the heart of our year plan jhoots pharmacy move into the village of knott end in and it be not long before constituent be get in touch with to explain that they could not access their prescription because pharmacy be closed and unreliable we do have the very good over wyre medical centre which have dispense right but it be restrain by the one mile rule which mean that it can not dispense prescription within one mile of pharmacy whether that be open or closed feel like we be in situation what help can the minister give my constituent to ensure that those who be within one mile of the jhoots pharmacy that be never open can access their prescription from the dispensing over wyre medical centre my hon friend rightly put her finger on the situation in which we find ourselves it be patently absurd that pharmacy that be not operate as she just describe be block the ability of other to step in and fill the gap that be something we have to resolve and it be part of the work have commission urgently we clearly have gap in the regulatory framework this be an unprecedented situation and we be work at pace to address it but she have rightly put her finger on this which need to be resolve we need to move one piece out of the way so that we can deal with the situation the way jhoots be treat its workforce the community and supplier be frankly appalling it be fail community who desperately rely on it the government be plan to introduce health bill at some point in the come month that will see the abolition of nhs england can the minister update the house on when the bill will come forward and what provision it will contain to strengthen accountability for the delivery of community pharmacy know that my colleague the minister of state for health be work hard on the drafting process for the bill can not give the hon member the exact date of its introduction but would be very happy to write to he with confirmation of the expect introduction date be pleased that this urgent question have be secure because have write to the minister about this company be also grateful to my hon friend the member for north somerset sadik al hassan who have give advice in the matter be pleased that the government be take regulatory action in respect of the quality safety and availability of the service but be horrified to hear that several of my constituent work for this company have go unpaid for several week please could the minister reach out to the relevant minister within the department for business and trade to see what else we can do for those people because it be simply not right that they be out of pocket that be an excellent suggestion will do that we be hear colleague after colleague say that staff be not be pay and if there be clear evidence of breach of employment law we absolutely need to look at that will follow up on my hon friend suggestion we have hear again this afternoon the line from the minister that pharmacy staff be employ not by the nhs but by pharmacy business and that this be just dispute between staff and the pharmacy business that should be raise in the first instance with acas holli froggatt from sidmouth former member of jhoots staff have write to to say that staff have email jhoots beg for their wage as they have empty bank account in normal circumstance the government like to lean on pharmacy to take the pressure off gps with such scheme as pharmacy first so how can the minister simply wash his hand of this situation when staff have go for three month without pay do not think that be an accurate characterisation of what be say be say that we be take action against jhoots from the regulatory point of view and there be clearly glaring issue with the payment of staff that need to be take forward through the industrial relation process both through acas and the pda we will give all the support we can to both those organisation to ensure that jhoots be hold to account my constituent in sedbergh rural market town have suffer greatly from the terrible pharmacy provision by jhoots medicine have be unavailable the pharmacy have often be close and staff and locum pharmacist be go unpaid yet pay slip be be issue so it be very hard for they to claim benefit have write to the minister and meet with the integrate care board doctor and neighbouring pharmacist say neighbouring but this be in westmorland which be minute drive away have step in to help as have the parish council can the minister outline what action he be take nationally to force jhoots to provide well service for my constituent we be actively work with integrate care board nhs england the general pharmaceutical council and indeed trade union to ensure that all of these issue be be take forward and give the urgency that they require sadly as have point out the regulatory framework be not adequate it be very focused on pharmacist and pharmacy premise and inadequately and insufficiently focus on business owner that be something that must be address as matter of urgency and we be work on it at pace the failure of jhoots be put unsustainable pressure on other pharmacy across my constituency but talk have not even begin on pharmacy funding beyond march of next year give the urgent situation with jhoots will the minister review the timescale for those talk so that our pharmacy that be have to pick up this extra work can have some certainty about future funding this be absolutely urgent as the hon member rightly say have commission official to work on this matter at pace we can clearly see that this be matter of national significance simply by the number of colleague in the chamber can give the hon member that assurance and would be happy to update he once have well sense of the exact timeframe and deadline we will be insist that thing happen as matter of urgency over the recess meet the singh family who run two pharmacy in my constituency the family be clear that despite improved funding they be still struggle with overly complex funding formula delay payment high energy price and drug shortage among other challenge however the positive initiative of pharmacy first and the independent prescribing pathfinder programme offer ray of hope will the minister commit to continue to invest time and energy in expand those programme and meet my pharmacy from rushcliffe to discuss they far we remain absolutely committed to the independent prescribing service and be work on the plan and strategy to make that reality we continue to support pharmacy first but sadly take up of it have not be as good as we would have like it to be the way it be structure and incentivise have not enable it to realise its full potential and we be work on that as well number of error be make by the previous government who do not set pharmacy first up to succeed to the extent that it should have do jhoots pharmacy have reveal the severe financial strain face community pharmacy the town of glastonbury and bruton be home to fantastic independent pharmacy continue to serve their community despite more than half of pharmacy owner lose money last year how will the government ensure that the regulatory framework be robust so that community pharmacy service in rural area can remain resilient and accessible the hon member be right this be about make the regulatory framework more robust as have point out it be robust on pharmacist on technician and on pharmacy premise but it be simply not strong enough when it come to pharmacy business owner the unprecedented case of jhoots be throw that into sharp relief that be what we be work on at pace will be happy to update she once we have some clear progress on the plan and strategy to beef up the regulatory framework to ensure that this kind of thing can never happen again last week meet staff from jhoots pharmacy in thorley and be shock when they tell that they have be unpaid for month but be still work some be struggle with their mortgage or unable to afford food for their child school lunch their concern be for their resident many of whom be elderly and vulnerable who have be leave without essential medication because of stock issue and unexpected closure they be good decent people who want to provide community service for our resident will the minister assure my constituent directly that the department will look at all possible option and work across government where relevant to address the situation that allow this to become problem and the specific situation affect my constituent now pay tribute to my hon friend constituent who be clearly go through an extremely difficult and challenging time strongly recommend that they contact acas and the pda or another trade union if they happen to be member of one his key point be about how we can ensure that this do not happen again the gphc be take enforcement action against individual pharmacy and we have to wait for the outcome of those action some of those be go through appeal process as soon as one of those action have conclude that will greatly facilitate and catalyse the process for go after any pharmacy that be not deliver to the service standard that we would expect staff and patient at jhoots pharmacy in south wootton in north west norfolk have be let down go month without pay or stock and with no communication from management the pharmacist leave after non payment when raise those issue with the company it simply refuse to respond the minister have refer to future regulatory change but give that the pattern be repeat across the country what urgent step be he take to work with icb collectively to ensure that staff get the money they be owe and that commission service be deliver will he not rule out take action against individual director as say we be in constant dialogue with icb and the absolutely get it we need to speed it up as it need to be fast and more urgent be clear about that and we be take this forward as matter of priority in term of take action against individual director nothing be off the table as say the regulatory framework as thing stand do not facilitate that so we have get to look at other option but there be view in the gphc that suggest there may be some way of look at interpret regulation and legislation that could facilitate more immediate action that be on the menu of action that we be look at for almost two year now the people of sheringham have be suffer from completely unacceptable service from our local branch of jhoots shortage of drug shortage of pharmacist issue with pay staff and litany of other issue have cause chaos include one resident send by nhs to secure emergency antibiotic find themselves stand in the rain outside closed pharmacy fearful that they would end up in will the minister tell people in sheringham and the surround village what protection there will be for service if jhoots be no long fit to provide they how be taxpayer money be protect from be lose most importantly how on earth be it allow to get this bad in the first place in term of the replacement for jhoots service that be where we be in situation because until pharmacy that be not provide service have be move out of the way it be not possible to move in and replace that service with another so the first step in all this be to take action against those pharmacy that be not deliver to requisite service standard as soon as we can get that process move we can start to commission and bring in alternative provider share his frustration and the impatience of his constituent and assure he that we be take urgent action on all these issue thank the minister very much for his strong answer to restore confidence will he acknowledge that pressure on the nhs especially into the winter month mean that pharmacy will be play big role in provide basic help and advice and that be unable to rely on pharmacy can not be sustain will he please outline the professional standard expect of pharmaceutical chain throughout the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and how these private company can be hold to their public obligation agree with the hon member on the vital role play by community pharmacy now and go into the future we want that role to continue and indeed to be strengthen and expand if we look at our year plan with the shift from hospital to community we see that community pharmacy be at the heart of that also in the shift from sickness to prevention we see the vital work that community pharmacy play in deliver vaccine and whole range of other service that really will support the prevention agenda so community pharmacy be at the heart of our plan the standard set out by the general pharmaceutical council robust standard that be robustly regulate require certain level of service to be provide and certain level of expertise and experience what we clearly now need to do be upgrade the way we regulate pharmacy business owner my official and be work on that as matter of urgency ukraine with your permission madam deputy

get the financial support it need to recover and that russia be the one to pay the whole house will be aware of ukraine acute financing need both now and in the long term so we be push at every level to ensure that frozen russian asset can be use to meet those need they be on the agenda of the finance ministers when they meet on october and the chancellor be in washington today again press for progress with her counterpart as have do directly with our european partner we will continue to argue that the full value of russian sovereign asset must be use to support ukraine the eu have develop

consensus for peace we know too the huge international co ordination that have come behind the us peace initiative in the middle east and the huge international effort that will be need to ensure it be implement those same principle on international co ordination and effort over time be important for ukraine that be why together with france the uk government have convene over country in several meeting of the coalition of the willing encourage contribution towards multinational force that would stand ready to deploy to ukraine upon ceasefire or peace agreement to help regenerate ukraine armed force so that russia be never able to attack again we be also implement the year partnership sign by the prime minister and president zelensky in january make real our commitment to stand with ukraine not just today or tomorrow but over many decade to come while ukraine continue to show its endless reserve of strength vladimir putin continue to show his endless depth of depravity time and again he have show his willingness to threaten the security and sovereignty of other nation to threaten democracy and undermine the world order and to kidnap ten of thousand of child from cyber attack in moldova to the deployment of mercenary in the sahel russia action seek to topple government fuel conflict and spread instability far beyond europe border that be why the uk continue to support ukraine not just to help brave people to defend themselves but to make clear that aggression do not pay and that putin do not win that force will be resist with strength and that criminal will be hold accountable ukraine security be our security and commend this statement to the house order as the foreign secretary with prior agreement with the chair be allow to speak little while long than the allocate time the same will be allow to those on the opposition front benches call the shadow foreign secretary be grateful to the foreign secretary for give advance sight of her statement would also like to welcome she to her place in her new role we meet again at the dispatch box we have shadow each other in many role and this time around it feel like she be follow in this portfolio on the occasion of the visit of the chairman of the ukrainian parliament to our parliament it be right that britain should stand with ukraine on what will soon be the eve of the fourth winter of russia illegal invasion of ukraine putin relentless effort to obtain the territory of sovereign european state by barbaric level of force have undermine peace in europe and the established international order in recent month we have see european and nato airspace brazenly and deliberately violate by russian fighter jet from poland to estonia to romania such aggressive provocation must yield strong deterrence against russia the same apply to the intensify aerial bombardment of kyiv the hundred upon hundred of iranian shahed drone attack civilian represent cruel attempt by putin to psychologically torture ukrainians but the bombing will not break their resolve from russia kidnapping of ukrainian child to the daily bombardment of propaganda and bomb britain must stand firm to level the play field for ukraine so that it can repel those attack we must continually refuel our country ability to support ukraine and never stand still be the foreign secretary broker more package here at home or across nato to support ukraine air defence the year partnership agreement with ukraine must be leveraged to support innovation in defence technology and production within ukraine right now while we also learn from ukraine success in these field the way the ukrainian people have conduct themselves and continue to fight for what be rightfully theirs in the face of the barbarity and savagery that many of we think be confine to bygone era will go down in history we must ensure that russia defeat go down in history too to do that britain must lead all ally to raise the price of russia aggression by cut off russia financial lifeline which continue to fund putin war in ukraine and fight against our democratic value welcome the foreign secretary announcement today of the new entity include the ship that have be sanction as of today she will know that china india and turkey have become the mainstay of russian oil export together purchase around billion of russian crude this provide putin with lifeline to fund this illegal war and invasion at the cost of around billion per day so in addition to the new sanction announce today can the foreign secretary confirm whether she or the prime minister have have any discussion with india turkey and china about refinery in their own country purchase russian oil and then re export it be the uk in position to spearhead direct challenge and get this stop will the foreign secretary challenge european country who be still import russian liquefy natural gas to phase this out far more rapidly recognise and appreciate her comment about eu country and the sanction package far to the new banking sanction that the foreign secretary have announce will she commit to review what we can do to limit russia banking sector include its regional bank on the mobilisation of frozen asset we need to go beyond just offer ukraine loan from the revenue of the sanctioned asset and find new formula under the law that mobilise the asset to fund ukraine defeat of russia in the immediate term london be home to our world class capital market and the city of london must be deploy to help find solution that our diplomat can then sell to our ally because this need concerted action can the foreign secretary confirm whether the coalition of the willing convene in february this year be as determined as it be then not just to stand with ukraine but to work to find solution to these major issue the uk must commit to spend on defence by the end of the decade this be vital step on our route to the higher sustained spending demand by the new nato target in her new role as foreign secretary be the right hon lady in discussion with the chancellor about this britain must be ready for continuous tension with russia with effective deterrent against sub conventional threat such as hybrid warfare sabotage of infrastructure disinformation election interference and killing if we do not put up boundary now russia will come close but it be stoppable we have see positive development in recent week include the decisive election result in moldova that should cement its euro atlantic trajectory but russia behaviour elsewhere from georgia to the balkans and include the stationing of nuclear weapon in belarus be deeply alarming here at home there be report that the cyber attack on jaguar land rover may have emanate from russia be the foreign secretary able to confirm that attribution the whole euro atlantic alliance need to be incredibly robust because the lesson of the last year be crystal clear and the outcome of the war in ukraine will shape the future of european global security president trump recent remark be absolutely right our ukrainian friend can regain the territory that be rightfully theirs and we support they on that britain and our european ally must now pull out all the stop to help our ukrainian friend to expedite putin exit from their country we should be clear that territorial concession must never happen as this would be reward for putin barbarism britain should and can lead the way in weaken putin war machine with full range of hard hit new sanction and broker new military aid package with our ally to ensure that ukraine have the capability it need to defeat putin tyranny welcome the shadow foreign secretary response and be glad to face she across the dispatch box again think she and have probably miss each other this time round we agree on some thing which be perhaps new experience for both of we check and think that the last time the right hon lady and be opposite each other although we be on the opposite side of the house then be on september the day that liz truss be confirm as prime minister it be perhaps not quite such good day for the right hon lady who then lose her place as home secretary it be also not such good time for the country interestingly after our exchange on that day the next discussion be on ukraine my right hon friend the member for rawmarsh and conisbrough john healey now the defence secretary speak from the opposition benches begin his remark by observe that it be day of war that vladimir putin have expect to be over inside week he salute the bravery of the ukrainian resistance and pledge the labour party full backing for every aspect of what the right hon lady government be do at the time now here we be on day and all of we in this house be still full of admiration and respect for the ukrainian resistance and determine to support ukraine in the face of the continue russian onslaught welcome the continuation of the shadow foreign secretary cross party support for the ukrainian people for the action that we need to continue to take to support ukraine in its defence and for the pressure that we need to exert can assure she that we will continue to support ukraine defence and to look at what more we can do the defence secretary have also set out new partnership in particular we be work with ukraine on develop new drone technology learn from its technological experience and help it with production the right hon lady raise issue about third country china india turkey and other european country that have continue to be involve in purchase thing from russia we want as wide consensus as possible on economic pressure on russia over ukraine continue to raise this with many different country include some of those that that she refer to also in our sanction package we be include sanction against entity operate in third country we need to continue to do so we need to be clear that the ability to target russian sovereign asset need to be about mobilise the asset and go far to ensure that there be an effective way to do that we believe that there be and we have be work with the eu on that we will continue to put considerable pressure on as many country as possible to join we in take action on russian sovereign asset think that all of we in the house or at least the majority of the party here with one unfortunate exception be clear that we need to continue to stand in solidarity with ukraine not just now not just tomorrow but for the future call the chair of the foreign affairs committee begin by publicly welcome the foreign secretary to her new post and by echo her comment about the previous foreign secretary also welcome her commitment to finally use the russian frozen asset hope that the situation will be resolve soon because those asset be need for the defence and reconstruction of ukraine be pleased to see that the foreign secretary be go to take further advantage of britain unique sanction regime by extend it against russian individual and company but she know perhaps well than most give her previous experience that regime be only as good as its enforcement and there be time when door need to be kick down it worry that official from the office of financial sanctions implementation tell the treasury committee year ago that they have issue only one fine against british business for engage with sanctioned individual how many british business have face financial penalty for direct or indirect breach of sanction on russia or the russian state since then and what have be the value of those fine welcome the point that the chair of the foreign affairs committee have raise and thank she for her considerable work and expertise and thank the committee for its work in this area as she will know the foreign office set out the framework for sanction and then work with the treasury on enforcement follow the publication of the cross government review on enforcement in may the government be commit to strong action to make compliance easy but also to deter non compliance and to ensure proper enforcement be advise that so far in office of financial sanctions implementation penalty have total over and there have be million compound settlement with his majesty revenue and customs in april the national crime agency secure the first conviction for breach of russian financial sanction but be happy to work with the chancellor to ensure that my right hon friend have any further information that she want on that topic call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of her statement warmly welcome the announcement of fresh sanction aim at cut putin oil and gas profit it be vital that we make use of all the tool at our disposal to undermine his war machine and we know that oil and gas revenue be primarily use to fund it these measure be further step in the right direction but encourage the government to go even far analysis by the centre for research on energy and clean air think tank show that uk own or insure liquefy natural gas carrier have facilitate the transport of billion of russian gas since the start of the full scale invasion that mean that of the total export value of russian lng be carry on uk own or insured vessel it be unconscionable that uk business be still contribute to putin coffer so will the foreign secretary commit to ban the provision of maritime service include transport and insurance for russian gas will she engage directly with the maritime insurance sector large proportion of which be base in the uk to find practical way to implement such ban be very pleased to hear of the foreign secretary ambition to progress plan to use the full value of frozen russian asset to support ukraine war effort that be measure that the liberal democrats have be push for action on for some month the government need to move at pace as ukraine continue to face putin relentless assault so can the foreign secretary confirm the timetable she be look at for new fund become available from frozen asset can she outline how those fund will be allocate and if barrier to seize those asset be put in place internationally can she commit to the uk government act unilaterally when it come to seize the asset hold in the uk it be more than three year since roman abramovich sell chelsea football club in june the then foreign secretary say that the government be ready and willing to take legal action to finally secure the billion generate from the sale that be earmark for additional support for ukraine it appear however that the government bark have be bad than their bite so far as we have hear no more about how the government intend to pursue those asset what concrete action have the government take since june to secure they we all hope to see just peace in ukraine when we do thought will switch to reconstruction can the secretary of state commit to provide full uk backing include funding to the council of europe register of damage for ukraine thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for his question and his continued support for ukraine we be determined to tighten the restriction much far not simply on the oil and gas company although this be the first time we have sanction these major company but on the distribution network and those who continue to profit on september announce new sanction include on more ship in the shadow fleet today in the second sanction package that have announce since be appoint have announce sanction on further shadow fleet ship because we be clear that the shadow fleet be undermine the impact of the sanction that we have set out on russian sovereign asset if what we do be to have proper impact both on russia and on the market it be right that we should work alongside partner and we welcome the statement from president von der leyen and the finance ministers can tell the hon gentleman that this be huge priority for and for the chancellor who be pursue those exact issue about timetable and about the final step we need to take around russian sovereign asset in washington today the issue of the proceed from the sale of chelsea football club be priority for personally we must ensure that those proceed can reach humanitarian cause in ukraine follow russia illegal full scale invasion be deeply frustrated that that have not be possible so far but we be fully prepared to pursue this matter through the court if require while the door for negotiation remain open again have discuss this matter not just with the chancellor but internationally thank the speaker the speaker office and the deputy speakers for the gracious welcome they today give ruslan stefanchuk the speaker of the rada also see the foreign secretary in kyiv on her first foreign visit be real fillip for the people of ukraine thank the foreign secretary for the sanction package but would like to ask further question about the seizure of russian asset be pleased that we be ready to progress the seizure of russian asset and that we have announce work with france and germany but be we work at pace with our ally to ensure the seizure of russian asset ukrainian know that their good chance of win this war will come from the move from freeze to seize asset will the united kingdom provide finance for the reparation loan that the eu propose thank my hon friend for his continued work for many year on ukraine it be certainly very good to see he at the event in kyiv can assure he that we think that the new mechanism that the eu have draw up and provide to mobilise effectively the asset that be be hold be really important we support that work and we believe that we the eu and other ally should try to make rapid progress now because ultimately the rebuilding of ukraine and support for ukraine should be pay for by russia welcome the foreign secretary to her new role and commend she on very strong statement welcome the progress be make by the finance ministers in dc on seize russian state asset it be an issue first start work on three year ago and know the chancellor have continue that work because of that there be body of clear technical analysis that have be do in the treasury that think show clearly at this point first that there be sound legal basis for take these asset and use they secondly that there be now practical way to use they especially as the bond have mature into cash and thirdly that by act in concert with ally any risk to financial stability can be absolutely minimise urge the foreign secretary to show continued uk leadership on this issue as know she be especially share that work with our european ally because know she would agree that this be an urgent issue that require action welcome all the point make by the former prime minister pay tribute to the work he do both as chancellor and as prime minister to support ukraine and the defence of ukraine in particular this work around russian sovereign asset as well as find different way to ensure that market stability remain and that we have the proper financial safeguard in place while also ensure that the money can get to ukraine have speak to colleague in belgium and france over the last week as the right hon member will know the prime minister have discuss this with french and german counterpart

school of public health humanitarian research lab reveal that the number of facility that russia be use in its force deportation of ukrainian child have rise from to that report highlight that facility be be use to re educate child and that at of those facility military training be be provide to train ukrainian child to throw the grenade and pilot the drone that be destroy their home and kill their family could my right hon friend outline what further step be be take to relocate rescue and return those child to their family welcome my hon friend point the forcible deportation the

such as bring kids back ua and save ukraine which be support effort to return ukrainian child just two week ago baroness harman attend the international coalition for the return of ukrainian children event at the un general assembly we will continue to do all we can to support the return of those child call the father of the house fifty year ago be work down the corridor here for margaret thatcher make that point to give an opportunity to the foreign secretary to pay tribute on the centenary of her birth to the lady who win the cold war with ronald reagan the other point want to make be why do we win the cold war we do not fire single bullet it be all about economic pressure on the soviet union russia precursor of course follow the point make by the former prime minister my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak think the whole house be determine and unite on the issue of russian asset also serve on the council of europe and everybody there be pass motion try to propel this forward be the foreign secretary confident that we can make progress on this because the way to bring down this regime and end the war be as we do with the soviet union to break they economically think all of we no matter our party would recognise the challenging nature of the job for all prime ministers the father of the house will understand that in coalmine constituency like mine there be obviously very strong view against the former prime minister to whom he refer but pay tribute to his long service in this place which he also mention there be strong agreement across this house we have to get those asset mobilise and get that investment and support into ukraine it be right that russia should pay the price for reconstruct rebuild and also defend ukraine it be great to see the secretary of state out in ukraine know it be very much appreciate by our ukrainian colleague she will be well aware that foreign investment be absolutely vital to the economy and to the reconstruction of ukraine what talk have she have with ministerial colleague and other about scheme such as the one suggest by the british ukrainian chamber of commerce which propose use frozen russian asset western government guarantee administer by the world bank to provide great availability of risk insurance for british investor in ukraine my hon friend be right that we need to look at different innovative way of provide the financial support and the commitment and investment that ukraine will need obviously there be immediate issue around defence equipment and support include support for the energy infrastructure that we be provide but there will also be issue around long term investment and we should look at innovative way to support that be the chairman of the all party parliamentary group on magnitsky sanction and reparation and we have encourage the last government and the present government to be much more aggressive about their sanction regime when we look at the number of people who have be sanction it do not compare to what the united states and many other have do first it be long overdue that the whole business of the money from the chelsea sale be settle it beggar belief that we have not manage to get that one do agree with my right hon friend the prime minister the ex prime minister rather some of we live in hope the shadow fleet could easily be attack by sanction british marine insurer who have insure those ship without that insurance they will not be put to sea because they will have no financial backing for it why we have not do that up until now be complete mystery to that be surely something we should get on with straightaway because we can act on it immediately thank the right hon member for his long stand commitment on sanction and on russia and ukraine the impact of the sanction be that any company or any uk company or resident that transact with as well as trade with those sanction body will therefore be cover by the sanction as well we will continue to look at what far we can do to keep increase the pressure on russia on the chelsea football club proceed strongly agree that this need to move as swiftly as possible and can assure he that it have be something on which have focus significantly since arrive in post we will continue to do all we can in those area to support ukraine my constituent be refugee

secretary but she know the home office well what conversation have she have with colleague from the home office about review the ukrainian visa scheme so that ukrainians can rebuild their life in this country welcome my hon friend support for refugee and for those who have come here on the homes for ukraine scheme and other ukrainian scheme as she will know the government have set out provision for the extension of the visa think the point to which she refer be to do with the home office mechanism and the timing of when application can go in will raise that issue with the home secretary call member of the foreign affairs committee the foreign secretary mention that speaker stefanchuk of the ukrainian parliament the rada be in the gallery early today he also meet member of the all party parliamentary group on ukraine when he draw parallel between western sanction package and version of the apple iphone it feel like we see new one every other week rather than the gradual introduction of sanction on russia will the foreign secretary work with the united states and other ally to introduce sanction package that will really hurt russian oligarch in the pocket want to see the strong possible economic pressure on russia from every avenue frankly we have discuss that issue extensively with the us and europe have discuss it with my foreign minister colleague and the chancellor discuss it with her finance minister colleague we want to see the strong package however it be right to continue introduce new sanction as soon as we have the evidence ready do not think that we should wait until more work can be do or more agreement reach if we have the evidence to be able to introduce another set of sanction we should get on with it because we need to maximise the economic pressure as rapidly as we can to put pressure on putin war machine do the foreign secretary agree that more must be do to inform not just the british public but country that be equivocal in their support for ukraine that russia illegal invasion be particularly egregious in its cynical and cruel targeting of civilian and civilian infrastructure pay tribute to member of rugby ukrainian community who tell today russia strike not only the frontline but home hospital and power plant whole region be leave in darkness after systematic attack just recently maternity hospital in sumy be target yet people wake up after night of bombardment and go to work and school the unimaginable have become normal that be the true horror do the foreign secretary agree that those horror can only strengthen our resolve in support ukraine we must maintain the strong of resolve in support ukraine have speak to family and child who will have to sleep in corridor or underground car park tonight to avoid drone attack but will still get up for school and carry on with their life each day the ukrainian people be show resilience and we will continue to support they the only thing wrong with the foreign secretary admirable statement be the fact that it be make by british foreign secretary rather than by the president of the united states give that only few month ago president trump say that president zelensky have few if any card to play the foreign secretary take much more optimistic view of the geopolitical situation as regard the invasion of ukraine have she identify any sign that the leader of the free world be come to more realistic view of the nature of the killer in the kremlin we have discuss this issue considerably with the us welcome president trump decision to allow nato ally to purchase vital us military equipment for ukraine defence include patriot missile president trump call for peace process and president zelensky be ready to have those peace discussion but president putin have do the opposite there be grow sense of frustration which everybody can see about the fact that president putin have just ignore the request for peace discussion and be instead seek to do the opposite not just in ukraine but in attempt to destabilise nato airspace the nato parliamentary assembly delegation of which the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke who be sit on the opposition front bench be deputy leader meet the ukrainian delegation at the weekend and also hear from president zelensky the line that we hear time and again from they be about the need for more weapon equipment and munition particularly deep fire missile and drone munition welcome the foreign secretary statement lot have be say about the need to unfreeze russian asset and use their full value she say that work be be do on that we in this house have on numerous occasion see thing happen quickly thing need to move at pace to ensure that the free industrial capacity that ukraine still have which can make those thing be fund and use as quickly as possible welcome my hon friend point we want progress to be make as rapidly as possible he will know that the uk have step up support for ukraine this year which include billion of military support more than ever before and thousand of air defence missile and drone we want to go far with the russian sovereign asset process rise order remind colleague that we have another statement follow by the business of the day question do not require preamble they should be sharp and to the point congratulate the foreign secretary on her appointment and welcome her remark about the consensus on the war in ukraine hold up well across the vast majority of the chamber she be fresh set of eye will she look at the efficiency of some of the aid might we work more closely with organisation such as the come back alive foundation or can more work be do in ukraine think that the uk be do good job on this but fresh set of eye be always welcome we always want to ensure that we provide aid and defence support in the most effective way and crucially in partnership with ukraine which as sovereign nation know where its great need lie that be what we support welcome the measure that have be announce particularly on oil and gas revenue they come as russia continue to target ukrainian energy infrastructure include state run power plant last night how be the government help ukrainian home to stay warm over winter and will the foreign secretary join in pay tribute to the huddersfield ukrainian club which have continue to support ukrainians who have arrive in huddersfield since the conflict begin welcome the support that my hon friend community be provide in her constituency that have happen right across the country she be right to focus on the impact on family in target that infrastructure russia be deliberately target the heating and lighting of family across ukraine as they go into winter we have just announce announce it in kyiv million energy support package that be design exactly to keep home warm and support the resilience of the ukrainian people through the winter give that time be the most precious commodity in war and that as former head of eliza manningham buller say britain may already be at war with russia why have we allow russia so much time to build up stock of mm shell for example three time the quantity of the entire european and american stock of shell how long do ukraine now have to hold out against russia which have mobilise its entire economy and put it on war foot to win the war at almost any cost to russia itself do we not have to up our long range weapon and other military support to help ukraine finish and win this war as just set out the uk have step up support for ukraine this year provide billion of military support we will need to continue provide military support to ukraine but we also need to encourage as many other ally as possible to do likewise when meet the ukrainian prime minister and president in kyiv be strike by how much they see the uk as lead ally but they recognise the need for international partnership and support we need to continue escalate support that be why we also need pressure on the economic side as well as on the defence side it be only by that combine concerted effort that we will be able to affect the course of the war it be privilege to meet the chair of the rada today and to add my voice to this house share commitment to stand with ukraine and in defence of our democratic value to increase economic pressure on russia we must sanction russian link country operate in third country include in the energy sector will the foreign secretary assure the house that she will apply maximum pressure on such company even when they be base outside russia itself agree with my hon friend as part of the sanction package announce in september and this month we be look increasingly at entity in third country that continue to heavily support the transit and export of russian oil and gas in order to ensure that those sanction can really bite have just return from ukraine where learn at first hand about the challenge that both the military and the emergency service face in deal with unexploded ordnance see its impact when visit the heroic patient at superhumans the prosthetic supercentre in lviv there be over amputee in ukraine as result of the war and the need be immense so will the secretary of state consider far strengthen the strategic health alliance and uk ukraine trauma recovery with additional funding to the million already pledge alongside our ally we will continue to look at the different form and way in which our support can be provide we have particularly highlight support for energy infrastructure and home but the hon member be right to highlight the resilience and determination of the ukrainian emergency service who have to respond every morning to see where strike have take place and in the middle of the night when the drone arrive we should all pay tribute to their bravery and strength all of we who have visit ukraine will know the stoicism of the people despite be bombard night after night they continue to rebuild often support by uk business and individual as well as other from across the european union do the foreign secretary agree that we must do more to continue to encourage business and individual to support ukraine in any way that they can but that ultimately it be putin responsibility and his alone to pay for the damage that he be cause to the country agree we expect putin and russia to pay for the damage that they be do through the unprovoked aggression of their invasion of ukraine we will continue to support ukraine and encourage everybody else to do so but ultimately we need russia to pay for the damage that they have do welcome many of the measure that the foreign secretary have outline today like she have visit ukraine and see the impact of the attack from putin and his flunky and like she have see the resilience of the ukrainian people believe as we all do in the chamber that putin and his flunky must pay for their crime will the foreign secretary confirm whether the uk government would support pursue legally those individual responsible for the crime through the international criminal court as the hon lady will know we continue to support international law and international court process she be right to say that russia ultimately need to pay the price and to be hold accountable for the damage it be do hope she also agree that kyiv be an incredibly beautiful city where many people be go about their daily life undeterred determine not to let russia win the politician civilian and soldier speak to last month in kyiv be unambiguous when ask what be the good thing the uk could do to help they win the war the hundred of billion of dollar of frozen russian asset that they currently can not deploy could help they bolster their military and swing the war decisively in their favour on their behalf will the foreign secretary use every power available to she to unlock those asset and put they in the service of the people of ukraine welcome my hon friend support for unlock russian sovereign asset the chancellor be raise that issue in washington with international partner as speak welcome the right hon lady to her place the experience that she bring from her previous role will benefit we all and thank she for her answer putin will have watch the israel gaza problem carefully and he will know that all eye be turn to russia to end the unnecessary conflict in ukraine what further step can we take in co operation with our american ally to seize this opportunity to end bloodshed and to restore education and hope for ukrainian child thereby ensure that putin realise that he have no option other than the cessation of russian aggression thank the hon member for his kind word agree with he that there must be no other option for putin than to cease aggression and that this be ultimately about hope for ukrainian child strongly welcome the sanction target the billion in oil revenue that the kremlin receive last year and the progress on the billion in frozen russian sovereign asset applaud the foreign secretary and the chancellor for their effort in build coalition with the eu and other to move from use the interest payment to use the capital do she agree that that recent breakthrough show that legally this money should be treat as downpayment on the reparation for the horrific harm that russia have cause which we know it will do everything to avoid pay my hon friend make an important point the eu have set out work link the issue around asset to reparation payment we welcome that work and we believe that there be strong basis to go forward we need to do so in co ordinate way and recognise the importance of support ukraine welcome the government progress on the frozen russian asset but it be disappointing that as yet they be allocate only to recovery and not military capability because russia be spend billion more than ukraine and her western ally on the war in ukraine the courage of ukrainian force have bring russia to standstill but do the foreign secretary agree that if those frozen asset be use today to close and exceed that military spending gap ukraine would have path not just to stop russia but to win we be already increase uk military support and we want to see that happen across the board the way to put the great pressure on russia will always be through mix of different measure include direct defence support support for the resilience of the ukraine people through their basic energy infrastructure and ensure that they and their community can keep go and by establish strong economic pressure on russia so that it be put in position where it have to change course all those thing need to happen at once to have significant impact on the way that putin be behave thank the foreign secretary for her statement and for her recent decision when she be home secretary about the ukraine permission extension scheme do she agree that when putin probe weakness we must respond by demonstrate strength do she far agree that the post war development of ukraine significant energy resource which may require british technical expertise would serve the dual purpose of help to reconstruct ukraine shatter economy and increase europe security of energy supply agree with my hon friend that ukraine security be europe security in many different way include in defence and in energy that be why it be so important that we should continue to support ukraine and ukrainians in the uk who come to find safety at the beginning of the war early this year join brilliant organisation call mighty convoy to drive some refurbish ambulance full of medical supply to ukraine while we be there we bump into another organisation call fire aid that take refurbish fire engine to ukraine from the uk that equipment be vital for the war effort but in addition the ukrainians we meet say that it be great morale boost to know that not only be the british government behind their war effort but the british public be too will the foreign secretary join in thank all the volunteer from the uk who drive equipment to ukraine to help with that war effort the hon member make an important point about the strength of support from across the country from community and civil society at time when ukrainians be show such resilience and strength it be important for they to hear about that support and to know that people across the uk have huge respect for what they be do and will continue to support it welcome the work of different organisation to raise fund and provide support for ukraine may thank the foreign secretary for extend the homes for ukraine scheme by two year in her previous role welcome she to her new role this morning the chair of the rada speak to the parliamentary group and talk of how russian manufacturer be use advanced electronic from white good to build their drone what will the foreign secretary do to prevent such vital equipment go to they through the export of seemingly harmless white good the hon member be right to raise issue about broad technology that be why we need to ensure that our sanction regime be continually update and respond we have see immense improvement in ukrainian technology on different response particularly around drone technology and counter drone technology we need to recognise the expertise and strength of the ukrainian people and the country of ukraine and to continue to show our support at every level that conclude the statement on ukraine will allow the front benchers few moment to shuffle over as we prepare for the second statement pride in place order mr waugh you do not cross the front bench even to take shortcut it be not on with permission madam deputy speaker wish to make statement on the action we be take to restore pride in place britain renewal be drive mission of this labour government and we know that that must be see feel and hear in every single neighbourhood our identity sense of patriotism and feeling of belong can all depend on the condition of our local area and the view from our doorstep our neighbourhood be the nation barometer for whether all of we in this house be do our job under year of conservative failure the needle of that barometer have increasingly point in the wrong direction the effect of this decline in pride in place have be corrosive it have erode people trust in politic and the state create sense of unfairness and that some place have fare well than other and open the door to the plastic patriot in the reform party who say that there be simple answer let say from the start that we be under no illusion about the complex cause of and answer to this decline the failure of the conservatives properly to fund local government the sharp transition away from industry and the broken tory promise of level up must shoulder part of the blame we can not and will not pretend that the legacy of any of those issue can be reverse overnight but as both labour government and parliament we can be confident that the way in which we restore pride in place lie not in this chamber or the corridor of whitehall the answer be in the community that we each represent our job be to give our constituent the investment and power that they need so that they can deliver the change they want to see in their community that be why we have announce the pride in place programme back up by billion this be priority for the prime minister choose renewal over decline and unity over division this be our plan for change in action give power and pride back to the people who make britain great there be two category of investment the first the main programme be the flagship pride in place programme which will provide up to million of funding and support to each area over the course of decade focus on specific neighbourhood community will need to decide how that funding be spend we will establish neighbourhood board in every place make up of local people resident business owner and community leader will come together alongside their member of parliament to come up with year plan for this investment they could choose to bring derelict pub back into use for the community transform board up shop into wellbeing hub improve local transport link create new playground or roll out community level service to help with the cost of living local people know well what change be need this programme be about local community take back control as long as the plan provide value for money the board will have our full support to deliver the change that the community need we be take inspiration from the new deal for community which under the last labour government put local community in charge of renew their neighbourhood but we be also adapt to the world as we find it today and learn the lesson of what do and do not work from the last time around the second programme the pride in place impact fund will provide short term injection of million per place it will be deliver by local authority for the most immediate result in three phase community space public space and high street and town centre revitalisation despite the short timeframe of the fund there be still an important emphasis on local collaboration we will ask local community to work closely with mps and local authority to ensure that investment decision reflect local priority and community need our economic situation mean that we be not in position to cover everywhere that would benefit from this programme we have therefore prioritise place with the high level of need those place that have be leave behind and let down and those community that be hollow out over year of conservative austerity for which the conservatives should hang their head in shame it be important to this labour government that every community have the power to renew their area so alongside this investment we have publish the pride in place strategy the purpose of the strategy be to promote the same principle of community power across the entire country and it centre on three aim the first aim build strong community mean bring people together we see that as the foundation for great sense of belong and local pride when people spend time with each other in their community include those from different background they see that they have more in common than separate they this sense of share endeavour mean that community be more likely to take step to improve their local area as part of that we will fund locally lead intervention to build community resilience encourage volunteer through co produce policy and tackle loneliness we recognise that that can be deliver only by whole of government approach so this section of the strategy include policy from the department for culture media and sport and the home office the second aim create thriving place be how we promote pride in place in the most direct sense by improve how the public realm look as government we see direct link between the decline appearance of our local neighbourhood and how people feel about not just their immediate area but the country and the world around they we acknowledge that the performance of the public realm be often reflection of the economy and the work of local authority which be why we be focus on growth and on fix the foundation of local government but even in time when the economy have be strong and local government be fund properly the effect have not always be feel in the public realm fix that disconnect be the inspiration for policy to encourage the application of shopfront design guide as well as the use of clean up power what link all the policy in this section of the paper be that they empower our community to create thrive place this be not an attempt to micromanage change from whitehall the final strand help community to take back control of their own life and area set out our plan to give people strong voice in what matter to they each of we in the house will have speak to constituent who talk of helplessness when the place that they live in be change in way that they do not ask for and that they feel they have no control over sometimes it be about antisocial behaviour on their estate other time it be about the shop be lose from the high street people want to be in control of their surrounding but that be such distant concept when they do not feel safe go out at night or do not have say over how their town centre look lot of those feeling stem from the effect of the conservative government year of austerity which take library and leisure centre from some of the most deprived and disadvantaged community when combine with the closure of pub sport club and social club it mean that for much of the country there be few and few place for people to come together and take pride in we be therefore introduce community right to buy to give local resident new power to save treasured asset give more people say in their local economy by create new co operative development unit in my department and require all authority in england to establish effective neighbourhood governance this labour government pride in place programme be an investment in the uk future back the true patriot who build up our community across every corner of the country alongside our strategy it aim to spark new way of governing where power and resource be more readily share with our community however like devolution this need to be the start of process rather than single event we have specifically design both investment programme with guarantee role for local member of parliament so finish by encourage member from across the house to get involve at time when trust be low and the demand for change be high this be an opportunity for all of we to make real tangible difference to our community by give real power to those we be elect to serve call the shadow minister this statement speak of pride conservative members have pride in our local pub of which have close in the past six month hammer by the labour party business rate rise we have pride in our restaurant which be close in record number under the business rate burden impose by this government we be proud of our local shop which accord to the british retail consortium be buckling under an additional billion of annual cost impose by this government we be proud of our family business the bedrock of our high street which be buckling under new taxis introduce by this government we be proud of our family farm which be also buckle under the new taxis impose by this government we be proud of our local council which face maxe out their council tax rate we hear of million at local level but council across the country be maxe out their council tax not to invest in new local service but to pay an additional billion of annual cost impose on they by this government job tax every year when it come to deliver service net billion bad off we be proud of the worker of this country of whom there be million more when the conservative party leave office last year in the retail sector alone have lose their job since this government take office as such this programme be fig leaf element relabelle from past programme such as the long term plan for town slightly redirect to labour area that cover up collapse in the ability of our elect local representative to invest in their community as with so many thing that collapse get bad every day under the labour party let pose some specific question to the minister first why be there so much complex governance around this why not listen to the cry of our local leader in croydon somerset and hertfordshire people across the political spectrum who be say why not just give the council the money to get on with this why tie this up in bureaucracy and red tape how much of this money have simply be rebadge from other previously announce government programme why the change in methodology in the interest of transparency can the minister set out for the house why the funding now seem to be land in area that be more likely to support the labour party how much of this funding sit outside of the spending review and be therefore deeply in question from the start how much of this money like so many of this government announcement such as on housing have be put in the public domain but promise as spend towards the tail end of the next parliament perhaps the very definition of jam tomorrow finally can the minister tell we how today announcement will help small business on all our high street across our country to recover from her colleague the chancellor billion tax hike in this year alone be disappoint by the hon member lack of contrition and his failure to say sorry the conservatives preside over year of failure during which over period of austerity local government and local civic institution be denude and deprive community be hollow out he say that we be fund area of deprivation that be because we actually care about fund those area candidly if have the record of the last government would not stand at the dispatch box and give we lecture let pick up the specific question that the hon member ask first why be we tie this up in process there be no process but we have say that community should be in charge the difference between this scheme and the thing do by the last government be that we want to put community in the drive seat and give they power we want local authority to enable and facilitate but we absolutely need our community leader member across the house will know they the people who be network championing and make change happen we want they around the table drive the change that their community need on the methodology the conservative party obviously do some fiddling but we do not do that we have focus on two metric multiple deprivation and community need that be put investment into the area that most need it because they be both deprive and critically have low social infrastructure and social capital that be why we be fund the area that we be fund we all remember the conservatives last prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak say that they actively divert funding away from area of deprivation that be something that the labour party will not do and have not do finally turn to the funding profile we be desperate to move with momentum we want to get the investment out it be year commitment that be an absolute game changer no government have ever say to community come up with an investment plan and we will fund you over decade we think that be game change for community on the ground but we be not go to wait we be already give programme capital investment to the place that be in phase in order to start the work of kick start that programme and then their funding will flow next year for those place in phase capital and capacity investment will be go into they from next year and then flow in the year after we be very clear about this opportunity for our community this be not about party politic so be incredibly disappoint by the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds this be an opportunity to support part of our country that have be absolutely hollow out would expect bit more contrition hon member why because of your record because you sit order because of your record my record because of you let we temper our language low the temperature and continue apology madam deputy speaker because of the conservatives record would expect little bit more contrition we be focus on the task ahead which be the opportunity to drive change in our community hope members across the house can join we in that endeavour the billion investment in the pride in place programme mean that brinnington and stockport will benefit from million investment what do the minister think of the former government levelling up slogan which in reality be levelling down agenda for opportunity ambition and trust my hon friend be completely right levelling up be hollow slogan we see from the record that there be no substance behind it unlike the conservative party we be do the job of invest in our community put they in the drive seat that will be game changer in constituency such as my hon friend call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome the minister to her place liberal democrats welcome the government commitment to invest in high street and community make our local centre thrive be cause that all of we across this house share however despite the strategy talk about empowerment and the government previously announce that they would simplify the system and consolidate grant this strategy do the opposite by create patchwork of small ringfence grant for certain area with strict rule on how local authority can spend their funding however what go unsaid in the strategy be perhaps as important the importance of community asset such as library and swimming pool be acknowledge in the strategy as be the lamenting of their loss but the strategy neglect to mention the deep cause of those sell off local authority face ever grow crisis in fund statutory service that they have to fund accord to government rule particularly social care and provision for special educational need and disability and be force to sell asset to keep those service go in this year alone billion of public asset have be sell off nearly three time the amount of the annual funding announce today in my constituency and in somerset as whole more than two third of council tax payment go towards the funding of care for child and adult last year the county succeed in plug million shortfall but that feat will become hard to achieve each year pride in place will struggle to succeed unless the government fix the care crisis council tax payer should not be bail out the government when it come to their duty to provide care and send system that work investment in the high street be welcome but be no substitute for give local authority the mean to protect their service and asset into the future will the minister tell we what plan the government have to relieve the care funding crisis at local level so that community can keep and maintain the service and asset that they value most will take each of those point in turn this be about empowerment we be drive through what we believe be the big boost to devolution in generation and there be three strand to that first we be put community at the heart of the strategy we have design it in way that do not just mean that local authority be in the drive seat because we consider it critical to put community leader at the heart of it this be an opportunity for we to galvanise our community to get people from diverse background round the table and crucially to build momentum to drive the change that they want to see we do not resile from that because we think it be absolutely the right approach alongside it however we be give more power to local authority whether that mean multi year funding or consolidate the local government finance system so that authority have more flexibility we see they as key partner in the driving of change on the ground thirdly as we create strategic authority there will be the big tranche of devolution to our city region and county region mayor that we have see so far take together those three strand be about fundamentally shift and transfer power from the centre to place so that we can deliver the change that people want there have be huge sell off of asset that be the legacy of the last year and it be tragedy for our community we have introduce the community right to buy so that community be able to identify asset of community value and to buy they and support from pride in place give they an opportunity to put investment behind that finally the hon gentleman ask about the critical issue of local government funding labour members entirely understand the pressure that local government be under there have be year of austerity drive by the conservatives and local authority be have to deal with very difficult context that be why we have move towards multi year funding settlement and why we give huge boost to local government financing last year over the course of the spending review there will be real term increase in local government spending power it be tight but we be do our part as government to ensure that local government can deliver for our community my colleague in the department of health and social care be drive through critical reform that will address some of the pressure that we know exist in our social care system welcome this labour government million investment in fairfield in my constituency which be ignore by the conservatives do the minister agree that it be crucial for this programme to provide not just new money but new power for local people to decide how it be spend will she confirm for the avoidance of doubt that the money should not be use to deliver core council service absolutely let put it on record that we want community to be in the drive seat that be how this differ from programme organise under the last government and if we get it right it will have huge galvanise potential what we want to militate against be the possibility of its just go towards business as usual if we can bring people from community to the table and get they to invest in the thing that matter to they but can also generate community wealth this will be potential game changer may congratulate the hon lady on her new role and perhaps strike more slightly consensual note in sutton coldfield we welcome this initiative it be good that it build on the town fund set up by the last government and we in the royal town be very pleased to be part of it can tell the hon lady that we be undertake extensive community consultation lead by royal sutton coldfield town council and its leader simon ward and that our local board under the chairmanship of doug wright mbe be forge ahead and already make considerable progress may invite she as invite her predecessor to pay state visit to the royal town of sutton coldfield where she can see how we will use this money to the good possible advantage thank the right hon gentleman for tell we about the progress on his patch it be incredibly encouraging to see the work that have already be do whether through the local authority exist board or the come together of community leader ask all member who can give example of this work well to reach out to other member on both side of the house so that those example can be share look forward to travel across the country and see pride in place in practice warmly welcome the million pride in place fund for the hawkesley estate in my constituency it stand in stark contrast to the hope and expectation that be allow to be build under the last government for million for northfield high street in the second round bid for the levelling up fund which be cruelly dash when not one penny be allocate to the city of birmingham do my hon friend agree that this will not be and can not be some lengthy bureaucratic process of course our council must be essential partner but will she confirm that the priority will be set in the community themselves absolutely we be try to make this as permissive as possible and we want community to genuinely choose the scheme and project that will work in their area as long as the community represent in the neighbourhood board be behind an area and be confident that it deliver value for money for they we will step aside and let they get on with it because that be absolutely the right approach my constituent in rowner be delighted to hear that they have be choose for pride in place funding but they be now little bit worried and hope that the minister can help we my constituent fear that rather than the money be spend on project that will change life in rowner in meaningful way our liberal democrat council will attempt to siphon some of it off to bankroll one of its vanity project namely the criterion dilapidated former bingo hall be pleased that this funding come with some flexibility but what protection will the minister introduce to prevent the money from be fritter away on white elephant by unscrupulous council shall not comment on the specific of the council but what will say be that we be very clear about the fact that the local community should be in the drive seat the funding be flow through council because they have accounting officer responsibility but the decision need to be make by the neighbourhood board my plea to member on both side of the house be this get the neighbourhood board up and run the recruitment of the chair be key and that be joint endeavour between local authority and mp the mps must be consult and must have the final say in who the chair be the chair can then ensure that the right voice be sit round the table ultimately the funding will go to back an investment and regeneration plan that the board will develop that will make it very hard for particular long stand project to be fund this must be part of plan that be support by the neighbourhood board and the investment will flow into that like other welcome this investment particularly the investment initially in merthyr tydfil and latterly in rhondda cynon taf which cover the aberdare part of my constituency it will make real difference to the community be sure the minister agree that it be crucial indeed critical for real engagement to take place with community when it come to how this money be spend but can she say little about any discussion that be take place about replacement for the share prosperity fund which will remain until march next year the shared prosperity fund will come to an end in march next year we will set out the detail of local growth fund which will be gear towards the area of the country that we think need it the most our mayoral authority in the north and the midland we will share detail of that in due course borderland be fully fund initiative launch by the former government and it be now support by the department the scottish government and the scotland office here in westminster it be design to meet all the objective that she have set out in the south of scotland cumbria and northumberland but for some reason only very small proportion of the money have get out the door can the hon lady in conjunction with the scotland office do full drain up to understand why the money be not get to the community project that it be design to support thank the right hon gentleman for raise that issue be very happy to take it away and to work with the scotland office to understand why the money have be block we be really keen to move at pace we want to get investment into our community and we want thing to start happen so if we can find way to unblock the investment we absolutely shall may welcome the minister to her place and say what an encouraging start this be all the funding that my community be receive be very welcome and it be such contrast to the previous regime approach where we have the crumb off the table and politically motivate process in which community have to bid against each other in system that be essentially rig it be always about what the government want to spend the money on not what community decide their priority be since the announcement of pride in place have have so many constituent come forward with great idea what assurance can the minister give that their voice will really count my hon friend be absolutely right to point out the difference in approach both in allocation and in the power that we be genuinely try to give community between this government and the last government we be very clear that community be in the drive seat the conservative party point out that thing be be make complex but do not think they be we be create route that allow community to be in the drive seat we have design the programme with that intent we have community delivery unit that will be work on the ground alongside member of parliament to make sure that community be genuinely drive and shape this and that we can unlock the huge potential to change our place congratulate the minister on her appointment and welcome the core principle that she describe give our community the power to decide how to put money to good use be delighted that torbay have be award two tranche of pride in place funding however it be perverse badge of honour because it demonstrate that we be the most deprived local authority in the south west of england the conservatives have short change we another challenge in torbay be the fact that social rent home account for only of our housing will the minister reflect on how the whole government can try to meet the desperate need for social housing in torbay which have less than half the national average thank the hon member for raise the critical issue of housing be incredibly proud that this government be put record investment into social and affordable billion because we absolutely recognise that if we be to tackle poverty and deprivation we must get to the root cause of the housing crisis we have to make sure that affordable housing be an absolutely right so that people in our community can afford roof over their head that should not be distant dream for so many after year of neglect under the previous government it be refreshing to see that under this labour government community such as new addington in my constituency come first welcome the million long term investment that this government be make in new addington its people and its future do the minister agree that it be vital that local people get to decide how this money be spend and can she outline what new power will be give to local people in new addington so that this money be spend on their priority my hon friend be absolutely right to say that at the heart of this must be the community that be why we have make the neighbourhood board absolutely critical and there be huge job for member of parliament from across the house in help to organise convene and bring together community leader who can populate that board we be very clear that regeneration plan will be drive by that board critically it will not just be the board in the drive seat big swathe of the community will be engage and they will have voice and say in what this look like alongside that we be make sure that there be community right to buy which have speak about so that the community be in the drive seat take on community asset of value there be huge opportunity but member of parliament and local government must play an enable role so that we can put community in the drive seat for the first time the future high street fund work well because to get any funding area have to demonstrate that they have plan and that the money would be use effectively in accordance with local priority pride in place be structure in very different way accept that the minister intent be to ensure that redundant premise be repurpose and reuse that be really good and as chairman of the trowbridge place partnership certainly welcome that however how will she ensure that the whole thing be not just bung up with endless legal challenge as her unelected board make diktat that will be subject to endless review there be the pride in place impact million that will go to local authority across the country to bring about high street regeneration alongside that there be this programme we be unapologetic about the fact that we want community in the drive seat we know that this be different approach for government but it be the right approach because we can not and will not address the huge distrust anger and frustration in our deprive community unless we give people power and agency to shape and drive the change that they want we will work as department to enable that have talk about the community delivery unit they will work alongside area to make sure that we provide capacity build support and enable support so that the investment not only work for the community in the short term but fundamentally build community wealth rise order member can see how many colleague wish to contribute unless they keep their contribution short they will deny their fellow member the opportunity to speak show we how it be do shaun davies refer member to my declaration in the register of members financial interests warmly welcome the million investment in telford which have be match fund by labour lead telford and wrekin council that mean that million will go to woodside brookside and sutton hill each and every year for the next decade will the minister confirm when that money will come to the community frontline will she also challenge government agency and departments right across whitehall to get behind the ethos of this scheme and make sure that community be in charge and that there be pride we will start invest phase place be already receive capacity funding and million will flow from next year phase place the place we recently announce will receive capacity funding from next year with full funding flow from the year after this be potentially way to revolutionise the way that government work we be very keen to work with departments across whitehall we be say here be way of invest in community that genuinely put community in the drive seat hopefully it have the impact that we want be really disappointed that cornwall despite have some of the most deprived town in the country will not receive penny of pride in place funding at time when our share prosperity funding be to stop be concerned to hear the minister mention that the north and the midland will receive pride in place funding hope she clear that up will she meet and my constituent fin irwin who have really exciting plan for bodmin fore street in my constituency they could be the basis for great pilot involve social housing opportunity for small business and community space and it would prove that the government want regional growth everywhere we be not able to fund all area wish we be so we have focus on particular area of deprivation that also score high on the community need index however we be also put in place whole set of power and provision so that every community can take control of its high street and other area and can use the community right to buy be very happy to meet the hon member and other cornwall members to talk about how we can ensure that that part of the country thrive will try again dr lauren sullivan will show we how it be do welcome the minister to her place thank she for gravesham share of the pride in place impact fund million over two year be really great investment so that we can restart build community and place and there be new possibility that once could only have be imagine these priority have be neglect over many year do she agree with that the impact fund will make real difference to gravesham do it be huge opportunity and if we get this right we will see tangible benefit in my hon friend constituency welcome the minister to her new position enjoy shadow she on the energy brief really welcome the inclusion of lakenheath in this announcement and look forward to work with she and with resident and councillor on make sure that the fund be well spend want to ask the minister how we build pride in place by improve local economy her department be contemplate its plan for the development of cambridge my constituency be very affect by that development and there be rise demand for new housing would appreciate it if could meet she or one of her colleague to discuss how we integrate new housing with transport connection in particular be think of connection from cambridge to haverhill in west suffolk thank the hon member and be very happy to meet he warmly welcome the government investment of million in the raffles and morton neighbourhood of my carlisle constituency as be very fond of remind members carlisle be the most northerly city in mile north of manchester and very long way from this place do the minister agree with that what be truly transformative about this programme be not simply the money but the fact that decision about how it will be spend be put in the hand of local people not politician and civil servant in what we in carlisle call that london my hon friend be completely right put local people and community in charge be game change if we get it right think it will lead to well decision and to an impact on place that matter to people however there be big collective onus on all of we to get that right the instinct to hoard power at the centre and to control be strong and we all have to work to make sure that we put our community in the drive seat congratulate all member who have secure funding in this pride in place settlement but once again perth and kinross have be totally and utterly ignore we do not receive one penny in levelling up funding from the tories and we have receive nothing from this labour government bad than that they actually take away from perth and kinross the million that we have finally secure from the conservatives the people of perth and kinross be sick and tired of be ignore in this merry go round of pork barrel politic when be we go to get our share and just what have the uk government get against the people of perth and kinross we have allocate local growth funding to scotland which we will announce in due course in addition we be work with the scotland office on the allocation of the scottish component of pride in place this labour government be invest in scotland and in our community but the scottish government be in charge and if our community be struggle in scotland responsibility for that sit with the snp rise call paul waugh who will not want to let down after his early infraction thank you madam deputy speaker in rochdale we warmly welcome this million investment in smallbridge and hurstead which be very much overdue be the labour and co operative mp for rochdale which be the home of the co op and we know more than anyone elsewhere the power of local people come together set their own priority and take back control do the minister agree with that this investment be overdue because of the year of neglect by the conservative party and whitehall and be vote of confidence in local people my hon friend be completely right like he be co operative mp and think the value of our co operative movement run through this programme it put local people in charge but it also say that it be by give local people stake give they ownership and allow they to generate community wealth that we make our place prosperous the minister describe those receive the money as true patriot but in my constituency we have not receive single penny of this funding be my constituent not true patriot there be plenty of place in the north of farnham and potentially in bordon that could really do with use this money invite the minister to come to my constituency so that can show she the place that need the money and the amazing job that other be do already we would have love to have have funding for every part of the country sadly because of the inheritance the hon member have encourage to raise this again of year in which the public finance be decimate and the conservatives crash the economy we be have to navigate through that situation however alongside the investment in the place that have be choose because of deprivation we be give all place the tool and the lever to reclaim their high street and invest locally it be damn legacy of the tories that be bear in avondale grange in kettering rather than three minute down the road mean that people opportunity be less they face more health inequality and under the last government they be tell to accept decline this million funding show that this government believe that no matter where someone be bear they deserve to have pride in their community while reform continue to seek division can my hon friend outline how people have pride in their home and bring community together be real example of true patriotism my hon friend be completely right and she put it incredibly eloquently we can change the country by bring our community together and give they the tool and agency to change their place so they have pride labour members be on the side of unity and of bring community together to drive renewal note that there be no reform mps here but they be on the side of dividing and of simple slogan and simple answer that to be candid will not change the life of people in our community the minister say in her statement our job be to give our constituent the investment and power that they need of course we all agree with that and today announcement be welcome however as fellow london mp she will be aware that the so call fairer funding review will actually decimate the funding of many london local authority my own borough of richmond be set to lose staggering amount over of its core government funding and our most vulnerable and disadvantaged resident will suffer interruption if you will indulge madam deputy speaker be be heckle by labour members order there be time get to the point will the minister at the very least commit to an impact assessment of the fair funding review change for local authority such as richmond and will she grant transitional funding we have be consult we have close the consultation and we be look through the response at the moment we have have representation from authority across the country include london this labour government be very clear that we will continue to invest in our local area and our community there be need to rebalance but we will do that in fair way that do not negatively impact deprive community last week go to the toddler group at open heaven church in friar park the mum there tell there be nothing for young people to do in friar park no playground no youth club do the minister agree with that the million be go to make the most massive difference to friar park especially give that it be local people like those mum who will decide how it be spend my hon friend be completely right the opportunity to invest through this in local community service and youth service be absolutely huge and put local mum in the drive seat be always good thing welcome the fact that south bridgwater have be include in this programme these fund come on top of the million allocate to bridgwater under the last government town deal part of highbridge in my constituency be equally deserving of funding so can the minister advise whether there will be any further round of allocate funding in this parliament think the hon gentleman be ask to do the chancellor job which shall not be able to do we think that this be an exciting way of invest in our community and that there be huge opportunity for we to leverage in additional investment we be very keen to talk to social impact investor and philanthropist about how we can invest there be also lot of interest among the business community local business and business improvement district in bring this together if we get this right and the funding in place leverage in additional funding we will have show that this be way of operate that we can then roll out across the country the featherstone people have great pride in their place but they be also shrewd they know that the tories do austerity trickle down economic and cut across the health service so they will very much welcome this announcement may push the minister little bit far on the question of new economic model top down economic have fail treasury mandarin do not understand what be happen in place like featherstone whereas featherstone people do do she see this measure as way of community wealth building from the bottom up rather than economic from the top down absolutely the prime minister speak about grassroots growth which be growth root in our community and our place where we build community wealth which fundamentally change and rewire the economic model and the economic settlement we be very deliberate about the fact that we want to put community at the heart of both drive change and drive wealth and economic opportunity that be how we drive up living standard the government be present the pride in place programme as win for community across the uk but the focus of this particular scheme be on neighbourhood of around people on ynys môn only one town even meet that population threshold that be not unique to my constituency it be the case across wales will the minister explain why rural community be exclude by design from this specific programme we be invest in rural community whether in somerset or wiltshire we have use very clear metric we have use deprivation and the community need index to focus the programme on the area that need it the most we recognise that this be part of big strategy whether that be give community the power to reclaim their high street the investment we be try to do through local government or critically the job we be do with our regional mayor to fundamentally drive economic prosperity there be big plan to invest in all part of the country for year in derby we have be push for this kind of long term investment investment that the fantastic community of chaddesden richly deserve it will take time and hard work to recover from the year of neglect that community like chaddesden experience would like every chadd resident with idea of how they can get the money spend and get involve to contact do the minister agree that it be key that local people have say in how that money be spend my hon friend be completely right this be huge opportunity to bring the community together and for they to be in the drive seat therefore reach out to all part of the community be one of the most powerful thing that members of parliament can do have an organise background and this be an organise moment because it be the ability to bring people those who be not normally around the table and who can not normally shape their place around the table and to give they voice power and agency minister the statement make reference to engage with the northern ireland executive can you tell what discussion you have have with my colleague in the northern ireland executive order it be not can you tell it be can the minister tell yes quick thank you madam deputy speaker can the

place and community investment and local growth investment more widely we will be work closely with they and ensure that we be engage with and try to design this with the northern ireland executive in my area of blackpool the damn legacy of the tories mean that we now live in the most deprived borough in the country high street such as those in south shore bond street waterloo road and lytham road have be leave to ruin will the minister outline how the million that can be use to restore high street can be use quickly and efficiently in south shore will she join in blackpool to meet resident and

funding for local government stockport council cover my patch some in every it spend go on adult and child social care that be not sustainable three year to do social care review be long time will the minister explain what conversation she be have with colleague in the department of health and social care to shorten that timeframe so we can crack on we be work closely with the department of health and social care we understand the pressure that the social care system and its failure which again we have to lay at the door of the conversative party be have on local government finance we be do what we can to give local government the flexibility to respond and increase the funding envelope but there be fundamental question about social care reform that be difficult and complex and that have be kick into the long grass we be determined to take this forward but we have to do it carefully and we have to do it well so that it deliver the impact that everyone across the house want to see the

there critically we be try to reach the community that need the great help for the final question call richard burgon not only as the member of parliament but as an east leeds resident be delighted that million have be secure for seacroft north and monkswood which really need it do the minister agree that the idea and answer on how this vital money should be spend lie with the local people in seacroft north and monkswood who be sadly leave behind and let down by the previous tory government my hon friend be completely right the answer lie with our local community if we do the job of create the space for they empower they and build their capacity they have the ability to fundamentally transform life in our community be determined to support that we be proud that as labour government we be put it at the heart of our approach and we be determined to deliver it point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker member will be aware that the upper waiting hall be this week host the speak their name exhibition of suicide memorial quilt from across the uk this would not have be possible without the help of house staff who have go way over and above to ensure that the exhibition and last friday launch with the baton of hope could take place may ask you madam deputy speaker to thank all the staff involve for their help and to pass on my appreciation thank the hon member for give notice of her point of order she have now helpfully place on the record her thank to those responsible for the exhibition and will ensure that mr speaker be make aware of that gratitude so that it can be pass on to staff police and crime commissioners accountability and review motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about the accountability of police and crime commissioner to make provision about the measurement of police and crime commissioner performance to make provision about the setting of priority for police and crime commissioner to require the secretary of state to commission review of the operation and function of police and crime commissioner include consideration of option for their abolition and replacement and for connected purpose my constituent be worried about crime and disorder across their community it be the same for great many colleague if not the vast majority for year now they have see rise in crime be it anti social behaviour in their neighbourhood crime on their high street or in more extreme case violence those concern really matter people deserve to be listen to and take seriously by the police be pleased that this government be take action with the crime and policing bill make massive stride to protect our community however it will take time to reverse the impact of the original cut to police number and the erosion of experience over the previous year the problem be that the public feel helpless they feel that no one be listen to they and they do not know who to turn to who to talk to and who be responsible for the police in their area that bring to the purpose of my bill that too often police and crime commissioner have not deliver for their community will argue that pccs need to be replace and reform with police and crime panel while the wide devolution process take place however first to understand the problem we must look back year to the change introduce by the then incoming government and their promise to bring democratic control over police through the creation of pcc that proposal result in pccs replace police authority and become the sole authority as prime minister david cameron explain that police and crime commissioner would lead the fight against crime and be someone to hold to account if they do deliver today how many of our constituent can name their pcc indeed how many know what pcc be how many of our constituent think that their pcc be lead the fight against crime many would say that the promise of that original bill have not be deliver and that we need to amend these shortcoming for the sake of our constituent how do we get here back in the first pcc election be hold turnout in the first election be just make it the low ever turnout for peacetime national election as prime minister david cameron promise that turnout would increase over time and it do but it be hardly impressive and certainly not representative in fact turnout last year reach across england and wales but it coincide with certain mayoral election on the same day the apathy for pccs remain the problem run far deeply indeed in the home affairs committee say that the pcc approach face number of challenge the foremost be the lack of public awareness of pcc and their function the relationship between pcc and chief constable and the lack of accountability the committee be concern that the introduction of pccs have see the creation of yet another layer of bureaucracy and additional cost with questionable impact on the outcome for police force it also note that there be considerable variability in the relative performance between pcc across the country and that the nature of the relationship they have with their chief constable can damage the model entirely the committee conclude that their effectiveness be highly variable and questionable there be also the matter of legitimacy as elect representative pcc be hold to account at the ballot box but with turnout percentage often in the mid teen the public be clearly not take they seriously also while police and crime panel exist to scrutinise pcc they be constrain by funding and formal power the panel be limit in their funding to year and this do not reflect the workload require to proactively hold the commissioner to account in term of formal power the police and crime panel lack the proper mechanism to hold the pcc to account the panel can only veto decision once be it budget or chief constable appointment furthermore pcp can investigate police and crime commissioner but in real term it be no more than polite inquiry across the country we see example of pccs fail constituent this become an issue for in warwickshire and not just through casework and wide constituent concern of which there be many it be truly crystallise by the news story of cover up between warwickshire hunt warwickshire police and the police and crime commissioner will not go into the detail but the allegation be that the pcc philip seccombe and the then chief constable debbie tedds engineer cover up that prevent case of illegal foxhunting by warwickshire hunt from go to court the pcc be supportive of warwickshire hunt and so be the chief constable whom he alone appoint in that be rubber stamp by the pcp between october and november write to the pcc and the chief constable six time on this issue they blank they withhold information from an elect mp and also from the police and crime panel the pcc claim that he do not have the information and that he have not see it believe he obstruct from get that information as result neither nor the resident of warwickshire have any trust or confidence in commissioner philip seccombe or the senior leadership team at warwickshire police there be clearly collusion that be what the public believe and that be what believe too the chief constable whose daughter work for warwickshire hunt retire early in september just three year after her appointment public concern across the country be not simply confine to ineffectiveness or collusion as in the case of warwickshire they also centre on cost in my home county of warwickshire in the run cost of the pcc and his office be staggering that be just for one year that be the equivalent of trainee police constable in warwickshire for one year across england and wales the total budget for the commissioner be just shy of million give that context be encourage by the government ambition to move the responsibility of pcc across to mayor through the english devolution and community empowerment bill but these change will take at least two year to come into effect so more immediate action be need in the meantime we could be save ten of million of pound year and divert that money straight to frontline policing it be increasingly clear that for the most part pcc have fail to meet the need of their community they have not bring great accountability or improve police outcome would argue that the time have come for we to change the system and do away with police and crime commissioner question put and agree to order that matt western chris bloore adam jogee debbie abrahams sam carling rachel taylor and matt western present the bill matt western accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday may and to be

in the house of lords any such committee as the chairman of committees may appoint new clause air travel provider use of sustainable aviation fuel reporting requirement within six month of the passing of this act the secretary of state must by regulation establish requirement for air travel provider to report annually on their use of sustainable aviation fuel regulation make under subsection must specify that the annual report include figure for sustainable aviation fuel usage which can be easily understand include express as an absolute volume and ii proportion of all aviation fuel use and that the annual report be accessible to member of the public include by be make available on their website any regulation make under subsection must be make under the negative procedure new clause economic impact of the act the secretary of state must lay before parliament report on the economic impact of the act this report must include but shall not be limit to the impact on the uk aviation

designate counter party to prioritise enter at least one revenue certainty contract with producer of power to liquid sustainable aviation fuel if do so will allow for at least one plant to reach final investment decision by december government amendment global demand for aviation continue to grow it be project to be two or three time big by in there be record rate of increase in carbon emission accord to the world meteorological organisation and there be new daily record for global aviation emission in july nearly half of all the carbon emission to date from aviation have occur since sustainable aviation fuel have be talk up for year as the solution yet there have be poor track record of unambitious target not be match by delivery for example in boeing announce the target that of aviation fuel globally should come from saf by and in the international air transport association set out hope of reach by but today globally the figure be just the uk publish figure this year of be well but it nevertheless show how far we have to go the conservative government promise back in to have five commercial uk saf plant operational by but there be still only one it be therefore right of the government to have introduce legislation to attempt to make sure that the late set of saf target move from fantasy to realistic credible and deliverable plan although these will ultimately need to transition we towards the development of truly zero carbon flight technology thank my hon friend the members for wimbledon mr kohler and for sutton and cheam luke taylor for their contribution to the bill committee and hope that member from across the house will consider the liberal democrat amendment new clause and all increase the chance of the intention behind the bill be realise new clause require the secretary of state to assess and report on the potential for disused oil refinery and similar industrial site to be use for the production of sustainable aviation fuel new clause require the secretary of state to assess the measure be take to encourage the supply of material for production of sustainable aviation fuel and have focus on bioethanol plant that be especially important in the context of the expect closure of the vivergo bioethanol plant near hull follow the government decision not to provide it with financial support new clause require the secretary of state to report to parliament on the development of strategy for analyse and maximise the potential of sustainable aviation fuel to contribute to reduction in greenhouse gas emission also speak in support of two new clause table by my hon friend the member for west dorset edward morello both of which would improve the bill by provide great rigour and scrutiny of progress towards sustainable aviation fuel target new clause would give the secretary of state the power to increase saf production obligation where necessary and to ensure that report on progress be lay before parliament and relevant select committees new clause would introduce requirement for air travel provider to report on their use of sustainable aviation fuel and to provide annual report to the public via their website collectively new clause to would strengthen the bill and increase its credibility when it come to saf production and report on progress the government saf mandate require just of aviation fuel to be sustainable by that compare poorly with the european union target of by it be hard to square an objective of net zero aviation by with just of fuel be sustainable decade early unless we put in place measure alongside saf to cut emission and make climate friendly flight reality we urge the government to clarify their plan for achieve their target particularly as hope for saf progress be be use to state that heathrow and gatwick expansion be compatible with our greenhouse gas emission reduction target as my hon friend say sustainable aviation fuel be be use by the government to justify major airport expansion one such expansion would be at gatwick adjacent to my constituency target of saf by be optimistic in the extreme as the climate change committee say if the government own adviser do not believe in this target why should we my hon friend make good point about what the climate change committee have say that be why hope the government will consider these liberal democrat amendment which be intend to strengthen the bill so that its provision become reality this time and contrast with the many miss target in the past on sustainable aviation fuel make aviation genuinely sustainable will require the government to go beyond secure investment in saf and to ensure that in the long term the saf measure complement rather than detract from investment in zero carbon flight technology hope that the house will support our amendment so that our country make big and more rapid contribution to decarbonise aviation this year petroineos that is jim ratcliffe ineos and petrochina from the chinese state close the grangemouth oil refinery closure be not about some passionate quest for net zero closure happen because private capital and foreign government own vital energy infrastructure and because corporate profit be more important than community good to the billionaire jim ratcliffes of this world there be job lose at the refinery and hundred more lose in the share service that be house on site job be lose in the wide supply chain that be mass de industrialisation but closure be not just about job loss the exodus of talented skilled worker be awful but closure also mean that the site be no long positive destination for many local young people leave school we have see an end to generational employer in my community the economic consequence be also absolutely enormous for local grangemouth business which rely on the custom of refinery worker and their family once again want to give credit to all the small local business that have keep town centre go in recent year the pressure of run small business when austerity and the cost of living crisis have hammer people disposable income can be all consume and incredibly stressful should know try it for some year the economic turmoil of stop refining be also national issue because the refinery be worth more than million per annum to the scottish economy politician often talk about black hole well that be sizeable industrial shape black hole to fill do not doubt that the government understand the magnitude of how important it be to re industrialise community like mine in grangemouth the other day read my hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane who have do so much work to bring this bill to the house describe in hansard the situation that he grow up in on the east side of manchester which lose its chemical and mining industry he say we be still get over that in my great city official report sustainable aviation fuel public bill committee july he undoubtedly understand the social consequence of industry finish up no community can afford this continue spiral of industrial decline to go back to my original point we have for decade be an economy control by private capital multinational corporation and foreign government whose policy have be to make thing elsewhere and to sell here have the last four decade not show that the country complete reliance on private capital mean profit over people we must adopt new industrial strategy that meet the need of work people and their community by secure at least some form of public ownership of the new industry that we will need that be mainstream political view the government must learn lesson to stop history repeat itself and to prevent worker and community have every last ounce of work extract from they before they be discard on corporate whim for the government to create and benefit economically from the necessary green industrial revolution which we need for our economy and for the planet some form of government ownership of future industry be necessary surely that view should be at the heart of any labour government if the government want to put their faith in private capital to mould britain new industrial future urge they to think again they need to be more active in the process of create grangemouth industrial future they need to seize the initiative and invest in worker community industry and scottish manufacturing produce sustainable aviation fuel be an enormous objective one that we have commit to and site like grangemouth be ideally place for it the infrastructure need some degree of conversion and upgrade of course but it be there the workforce and expertise be there my local community need to be re industrialised the labour government have ambitious saf target to meet but more importantly they also have obligation to community in our forget industrial heartland new clause table by my hon friend the member for didcot and wantage olly glover would require the government to publish report within six month of secure the supply of bioethanol for sustainable aviation fuel production the government have repeatedly cite the increase use of saf as the answer to question about how the uk will meet our net zero target while expand multiple airport in london it be wishful think nine month ago but that argument have now dissolve almost into impossibility not only do the summer proposal submit by heathrow airport holdings for third runway include request to add nearly flight to our airspace each year but the concern regard the production of saf have become more prominent that concern have grow follow china implementation of its own saf mandate which will result in it use more of its production domestically that will undoubtedly cause challenge for the uk give that over of our current saf be import from china the challenge to the uk ability to produce and import saf be underscore by the climate change committee recent report which estimate that only of the uk aviation industry will be use saf by that be low than the government own mandate target and below the eu target the estimate do not even take into account the additional flight that would come in and out of the uk as result of the propose airport expansion in fact in only of bioethanol certify as renewable and consume in the uk be produce domestically that be down from in and in concern trend and one that the government must report back on in addition the uk us trade deal present threat to the uk domestic bioethanol production as the agreement remove tariff on us ethanol and replace it with zero tariff quota of billion litre the us bioethanol industry be heavily subsidise and its company will be able to undercut uk bioethanol industry vivergo fuels plant in hull which have the large capacity of any uk bioethanol producer have already close with the manage director cite the us uk trade deal as significant factor that contribute to the site closure new clause would require the government to assess the impact of future plant closure on the production of saf and would ensure that option to mitigate the supply risk be investigate this be sensible proposal give the uncertain future face our production site the amendment be necessary not only to protect our domestic plant but to enable the roll out of clean energy source the government plan to increase the capacity of our airport will result in unavoidable environmental damage and fall short of our mandated saf target will only result in more pollution over our airspace follow the government invitation to heathrow to submit proposal for third runway in january ask the company for percentage projection of the flight that will run on first second and third generation saf by alarmingly that question could not be answer last month ask the same question again but response have not be forthcoming it be unacceptable that heathrow can propose billion project but not have the figure to substantiate its environmental mitigation stem from the chancellor announcement in relation to the third runway it be evident that support for that runway be drive by misguided financial incentive with our environment be force to take back seat the government must not discard their environmental commitment and the liberal democrats will continue to hold they to account on they the first step towards protect our air quality be for the government to support new clause if they do not plan to get behind it will the minister explain why will speak to new clause context be important as this bill be first step on long pathway to decarbonise aviation at the moment saf component be blend with exist fossil fuel to create usable aircraft fuel as will go on to discuss but think it be helpful for we to be aware of the context the various generation of sustainable aviation fuel that will form road map as we move into the future first generation aviation fuel use oil often of biological origin as feedstock and they produce kerosene type fuel that can be blend with our exist jet fuel second generation saf be derive from solid waste that go through digestion process produce alcohol that can then be formulate into aviation fuel type product third generation fuel remind hon member that there be four generation use wet mass as feedstock again that wet mass might be biological but it be incapable of compete with food crop for production and the process produce an output that be much like bio crude oil as we move through the generation of sustainable aviation fuel production it be important to remember that the output be different and be able to slip into different part of the exist fuel production supply chain the fourth generation be derive from gas maybe even atmospheric gas such as carbon dioxide draw from the atmosphere it be often refer to as power to liquid process and be an entirely non biological process that require lot of new technology it be future solution but an advantageous and attractive one as it can provide we with purely synthetic fuel the point that be illustrate be that the bill be the first step in long term vision for aviation in which sustainable aviation fuel be able to play progressively large role in future we may even move to different fuel all together as chair of the all party parliamentary group on hydrogen would like to give shout out to its role in the potential long term future of power for aviation these generation of fuel also interact with the technology in our aircraft although current blend of sustainable aviation fuel can go into aircraft now the aircraft will need to be upgrade as we move to high fraction of sustainable component in that fuel because some of the aromatic component in fossil fuel be not available in synthetic fuel they be currently require by some of the seal in the engine and the aircraft will need to move into future generation to accept high proportion of aviation fuel all of this be about have strategic road map the bill be one step one vastly enable piece of legislation and it follow model that be well prove to help establish new technology as part of green and sustainable future we have see the similar progress in offshore wind for example where it have be utterly transformational beyond anybody expectation this vehicle should be able to do similar thing for the beginning of our journey on decarbonise aviation but it need long term plan that be why there be really important piece of work to be do in the secondary legislation enable by the bill it be very important that that legislation take account of all the factor be discuss through the various amendment that have be table oppose new clause because we must not oversimplify the journey before we in fact we must allow the government the freedom to create sophisticated technically lead strategy to deploy these different type of sustainable aviation fuel take into account all factor include our exist infrastructure the production of biomass and the advancement of aviation technology if we get this right and if this game be play well we have the opportunity to start successfully and even lead journey that will be absolutely transformative and to envisage thriving positive and sustainable future for aviation for many year commute by aircraft from scotland to dublin so many year in fact that can still recall there be eight emergency exit on boeing there be two at the front two at the rear and four over wing exit what great pity that this bill do not have an amendment that be an escape slide while sustainable aviation fuel sound wonderful it be burden with many inconvenient fact the first be that there be no saf production industry at the scale require while new clause be bold attempt to jump start production by repurpose old facility it be jumbo jet of task the world economic forum estimate that by global demand for saf be expect to reach million tonne per annum around to of total jet fuel consumption meeting likely demand in just five year require an additional million tonne of capacity what be the investment require to reach even that relatively modest goal the wef pitch it at somewhere between billion and billion globally if that do not give our legislative autopilot the warning terrain terrain pull up then it should do new clause be unaffordable whether back by public or private finance and be afraid it be doom to fail it be certain that the vast input cost will result in massively high cost for passenger and air freight support the vital new clause which would force an assessment of the economic impact of this bill which fear will be nothing short of devastating some might piously accept few flight to the costas or little less airfreighted kenyan mangetout on the dinner table but make air travel ruinously expensive will have implication for thousand of job million globally in not only aviation but tourism many flight be not indulgence but lifeline we be an island nation and many community within the uk be entirely reliant on air link will britain so long the pioneer of aviation with history stretch back to the first schedule international passenger flight and the first jet airliner be foremost in saf probably not for mandate saf be easy than produce it especially in country with power price as exorbitant as ours energy bill in dumfries in my constituency be four time what they be in dumfries in virginia in the united states and they be cheap still in china we need lot of power to make saf many question its green credential when so much carbon be generate in its production amendment be bid to explore the serious issue around saf derive from either organic or synthetic source much be make of an reduction in greenhouse gas use saf source from waste fat and oil feedstock but as we have hear those basic building block be in limited supply that issue be also address in though not solve by new clause use crop as feedstock may not reduce greenhouse gas at all and there be huge implication of turn prime agricultural land and billion of gallon of water over to produce crop for fuel rather than food again britain be at disadvantage america vast corn belt might get involve but the british bioethanol industry be warning to we for it be not able to survive on current target for the content in road fuel other amendment include amendment concern themselves with how revenue certainty mechanism will operate my concern be that we risk create self lick ice cream self perpetuate system with no purpose other than to sustain itself this bill could guarantee money that simply offset the cost of manufacture saf which be itself make expensive by green levy would it not be well to put what money we have available into aviation excellence drive up the efficiency of jet engine and airframe aviation be already play its part in reduce its carbon footprint accord to some expert engine efficiency be already up by as much as from the early day of the de havilland comet jet liner that progress can continue although super efficient jet need superalloy to handle the extreme of temperature in their engine and those require the sort of rare earth that china be hoover up canada by the way have many of the same critical mineral might we be well off invest in those than subsidise saf if we want really big carbon saving we ought to look to the sea much of what we trade in and out go by sea and cargo ship be heavily reliant on bunker oil tar like substance with heavy emission if we want novel fuel this island nation should look once more to tennyson boundless deep where the salt cake smoke stack belch still meanwhile the wild blue yonder of the sky must not be make inaccessible simply by expensive green dogma aviation be central to our economy and our way of life whether it be deliver well over job here in the uk contribute over billion to our economy drive inbound tourism or connect community business and family the world over be proud of our world lead aviation sector in derby and many other place across the uk and while aviation be an integral part of our economy it be also one of the most challenging to decarbonise despite the scale of the challenge though we must keep push forward because as have say before and as will say again now without net zero in aviation there be no net zero full stop to ensure that future generation be able to access the opportunity that air travel can provide we need to make sure that fly be greener this bill do exactly that it will unlock the potential of uk saf by deliver the confidence and stability that saf producer need to continue to turbocharge growth as they drive forward green innovation welcome the bill as clear statement of intent that this country be absolutely serious about decarbonise the future and future proof our world lead aviation sector it be the right thing to do and we must do it chair the all party parliamentary group for the future of aviation travel and aerospace and the debate on saf have be focus of many of our meeting as cover all should declare my interest have meet with airportsuk airlines uk ads group lanzajet back british saf valero alfanar and other over the past six month also work in the aviation industry for year prior to be elect rise to speak in support of new clause to table by my colleague and new clause also encourage the government to support amendment and table by the conservatives which would strengthen and improve the bill and give we the good chance to achieve its target will tell the house why in aviation account for of global energy relate emission however when non effect be include its contribution to climate warming increase to approximately although that be small fraction of global emission it be not insignificant however in my experience few sector take their role in bring down emission and tackle climate change as seriously as aviation primarily because fuel burn and emission release be money spend as other member have already make clear decarbonise aviation and achieve net zero carbon uk aviation will require huge range of different measure measure such as operation blue skies global contrail avoidance system will reduce the density of the heat trap contrail produce by aircraft which create nearly half the overall climate warm impact continue improvement in aircraft engine and airframe efficiency be also critical and that too have be mention by other british innovation in aviation be something of which we should be incredibly proud project such as the airbus wing of tomorrow programme which see at the plant in filton in bristol this summer deliver continue improvement in carbon emission per revenue passenger kilometre that will form huge slice of the reduction in fuel consumption other innovation and scheme that be already in the mix also present opportunity for greener aviation airspace modernisation will produce more direct flight route less congested airspace and few en route delay and smart investment in capacity building have the potential to reduce landing and take off delay that burn fuel as aircraft circle airport or idle on taxiway wait for slot in the long term have confidence in our world lead aviation industry to develop true zero carbon aircraft power plant alternative such as battery hybrid and hydrogen power flight an example be zeroavia which be at the cutting edge of pure hydrogen power flight in the cotswolds and which also visit in august in the meantime however we must look to sustainable aviation fuel to reduce the carbon emission of our current technology aircraft and bridge the gap until technology can catch up this technology can deliver proportionately the great reduction in emission by saf can achieve an average of more than greenhouse gas emission saving on lifecycle basis and we can achieve twice as much energy capture by produce saf as from produce energy from waste for example third generation safs at the most exciting cutting edge of saf production could produce aviation fuel from thin air by combine carbon dioxide and green hydrogen power by renewable energy when it come to the major contributor to climate change emission around the globe almost every use of fossil fuel have readily available alternative that can be swap in for immediate use the only barrier be availability we have make huge stride in industry where we recognise the benefit not just to the economy but to society and to individual liberty and quality of life which mean that we must preserve and enhance they for future generation over the past year our train have develop from coal to diesel to electricity power we never countenance the idea that we should use our rail network less or travel less around the grow network of railway that build great britain for year instead we invest in the technology that allow we to continue to trade and travel with reduce emission and pollution our electricity generation have go from coal to gas and now to solar wind and nuclear again we do not suggest that we should phase out the lightbulb or electric kettle or the factory power by electricity that build the export that be now trade around the world we step up and become world leader in carbon free power petrol guzzle road vehicle be now be replace at an encouragingly fast rate by their hybrid and fully electric alternative and again we do not suggest the retirement of the bus that carry the people and the lorry that carry the good and serve as the backbone of britain we push forward with battery and hybrid power plant and the tightening of emission standard for fossil fuel vehicle britain have long be able to bank on its wealth of innovation and expertise we reject short termism and refuse to accept that the energy transition be zero sum game in an age of populism and dare say eco populism whatever that be it be more important than ever that we fall back on that proud tradition we should not in fact we can not give in to world view of climate action that be stunt by the blinker of zero growth miserly defeatist mindset the british people deserve well than that they can not be expect to go willingly into green future if that future be one in which they be poor or face restriction on their mobility and liberty but that be exactly what restrict the ability of our community and industry to travel and trade around the world via our global aviation network would do let be clear if do not think we could make this transition in aviation would not be take this view although share and support the healthy scepticism of many of my colleague tend to approach issue like this with yes attitude yes if we can deliver the saf require to meet the saf mandate target and the result emission reduction we must go ahead with it from everything have learn from my own experience everything have hear and see from the industry and my faith in great british innovation know we be capable of deliver that saf measure like those in this bill provide good starting point for this revolution the bill be support by all party and by uk airline and airport and it should be straightforward to pass this afternoon again we be compete to make it well be glad to see that most of we in this place recognise that the uk world lead aviation sector support over million uk job and be an enabler of key uk growth generate industry and exporter as recognise in the industrial strategy ask all member to support the burgeon domestic uk saf industry as it seek to add new job by and up to by thereby incentivise billion of pound of investment into former uk industrial heartland as mention by colleague welcome the minister to his place and thank he for finally deliver this bill follow his contribution in committee encourage the government to take on board the amendment and new clause which be sure be mean to improve this bill and make our climate change goal that bit easy to achieve greatly welcome the progress of this vital bill which will help ensure that the united kingdom take genuine global lead in the development and use of sustainable aviation fuel sustainable aviation fuel be the key to solve many of the challenge we face today and those we will face in the decade to come aviation currently account for around of the uk total emission as demand for travel continue to grow that figure will only rise unless we act now if we be to meet our net zero commitment while keep fly affordable and accessible sustainable aviation fuel must be at the heart of our strategy it offer one of the most practical and immediate way to decarbonise flight reduce our reliance on fossil fuel and secure the economic future of one of britain most successful industry that be why this bill be so essential for our environment our economy our technological leadership and the future of british aviation would like to draw attention to the million investment by exolum in the exist redcliffe bay facility in my constituency of north somerset which be already happen without the need for new clause it will be the home of the uk first independent sustainable aviation fuel blending facility when it become operational in it will underpin green fuel supply for some flight to major airport include heathrow gatwick cardiff and of course bristol my hon friend be make very powerful point will he join in thank our hon friend the member for stockton north chris mcdonald and his predecessor alex cunningham for secure the alfanar investment in that constituency and our right hon friend the member for redcar anna turley for secure investment at the wilton international centre which will lead to many hundred of secure permanent job my hon friend be of course right to highlight such advocacy in the sector welcome his contribution the exolum project be not just boost for our regional economy it be clear signal that the uk can combine its climate ambition with sound industrial strategy the production subsidy for saf introduce by this bill be therefore already very welcome and be the right step forward but production plant be only as good as their ability to get their product to market without that capability they can not attract investment or access the very subsidy that this bill rightly establish fortunately the uk be bless with an extensive aviation fuel pipeline and storage network one of the most advanced in the world company such as exolum be already use that network to deliver clean fuel across the country from my visit to redcliffe bay know that exolum have additional storage capacity that it would like to bring back into use to help deliver even more saf company at the forefront of this shift such as exolum must be support to deliver further investment at redcliffe bay in my constituency and at other site and across the national pipeline network to create new saf super highway for the uk such network would allow producer to get their fuel to market efficiently and it would secure our long term position as global leader in green aviation crucially my constituency be also home to bristol airport which have demonstrate real leadership in this sector in march almost year ahead of the government mandate begin operate flight from bristol airport use saf cut emission by an impressive however our ambition for clean flight can not stop at saf bristol airport same leadership can and should be apply to hydrogen in aviation ensure that the south west continue to lead the uk journey to green sky hydrogen be key element of the future aviation landscape and the broad energy transition as we stand at the crossroad and decide which industry and technology to support we must not overlook the infrastructure that will support hydrogen tomorrow as well as its supply chain its production and its distribution investment in hydrogen benefit both the industry of today and the industry of however that investment require certainty which only government direction and leadership can provide via road map already lay out in this bill believe deeply in the potential of hydrogen and be proud that the south west be uniquely position to take advantage of this opportunity we have world class research facility such as those have visit at the university of bath innovative small and medium sized enterprise such as hyflux in north somerset and cluster of industry already look to the hydrogen future for my constituent in north somerset this bill in its current form deliver both clean sky and sustainable future for vital industry look ahead to hydrogen in aviation the opportunity be particularly exciting for our region the research development production and infrastructure require for hydrogen fuel be rightly take root in the south west near bristol which be the home of ai in the uk where the fantastic mayor helen godwin be create job drive innovation and position we at the forefront of this emerge technology this bill be not merely climate policy it be economic strategy industrial ambition and national leadership combine sustainable aviation fuel be essential to the survival of our aviation industry but let we not allow our ambition to cease there hydrogen represent another key to unlock our sustainable future in the uk and this bill provide we with the learning we will need to make hydrogen in aviation reality be pleased to rise to speak to my new clause and amendment support the intention of the bill and want to strengthen it with my amendment which believe be essential to ensure this legislation deliver real lasting impact for our climate our economy and our position on the global stage the bill rightly seek to unlock private investment in uk sustainable aviation fuel through revenue certainty mechanism this be welcome and necessary step that give certainty to business look to invest in this world lead mechanism to decarbonise the aviation sector however if we be serious about climate leadership prevent the bad effect of climate breakdown and long term energy resilience we must do more than build framework we must prioritise the right fuel that be why my new clause focus on power to liquid sustainable aviation fuel not all saf be equal power to liquid saf be the clean most sustainable option we have in my opinion it be make from renewable electricity and capture carbon and it do not rely on limited or environmentally questionable feedstock such as use cook oil or palm derivative it be future proof and it be essential if we be to hit our net zero target without compromise environmental integrity the government themselves in their saf mandate guidance recognise power to liquid fuel as have the great potential the committee on climate change have say that we need twh of synthetic fuel by to stay on credible path to net zero the potential be there but it will remain untapped unless we take deliberate action to bring this industry to life new clause be simple but strategic it would require the secretary of state to use the power under the bill to prioritise enter into at least one revenue certainty contract with power to liquid saf producer where do so will allow project to reach final investment decision by the end of be not ask for handout be ask for the government to show the leadership need to de risk the first mover just as other country be do across europe and north america without that certainty no bank will lend and no project will proceed new clause would send clear message that the uk be open for clean aviation self reliance and energy security thank my hon friend for give way he be make some very persuasive point support the intention of the bill and push for these fuel be absolutely the right thing to do but do he agree that we must also keep focus on the wide opportunity for example in hydrogen battery electric system and next generation fuel if the uk be to be leader in this technology thank my hon friend for his intervention and wholeheartedly agree we in the uk have the capability to be leader in these technology and we must take collective approach on green energy for both environmental and economic gain we need certainty for private capital to flow in and the delivery of long term taxpayer return amendment look at the saf mandate itself it require review within month of the sub target for power to liquid fuel to assess whether it be ambitious enough and whether it reflect the urgency of the climate challenge and the pace of international competition this be not about set target in haste it be about ensure our target be base on evidence consultation and real world feasibility the amendment explicitly require engagement with power to liquid producer airline expert and wide stakeholder and it require that report be lay before parliament let be clear do not stand alone in call for this more than organisation from airline and clean energy firm to researcher and investor have call on the government to prioritise ptl through the bill they have call for urgent engagement timely regulation and clear pathway to commercial scale plant in the uk by we already know the eu be move fast alongside canada and the united states with more ambition on ptl if we fall behind we will become importer of clean fuel not exporter of clean technology and we will miss the industrial opportunity star we in the face time be of the essence and we must all work together to get this right be listen very carefully to what the hon gentleman say and completely support his good intention the problem with sustainable aviation fuel be that it be perhaps five time more expensive than what we be currently pay and that stock be very limited and we have be talk about livestock feed even more difficult be completely with he on the ambition but we must also protect consumer right the right to fly at reasonable cost and the cost to the economy as with all green energy policy there must be balance be sure he will agree with that thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention and do understand his point this be transition we be move away from fuel that be kill our environment and our ability to survive on planet earth it be responsible thing to do to find way to reduce our reliance on carbon generate fossil fuel through clean alternative this may not be the final solution for aviation it might be transition future technology and innovation might allow we to stop the use of such fuel altogether more than organisation from airline and clean energy firm to researcher and investor have call on the government to prioritise ptl through the bill they have call for urgent engagement timely regulation and clear pathway to commercial scale plant in the uk by as have mention the eu canada and the united states be move fast we must not miss this industrial opportunity to take lead in progress innovative saf alternative and license that technology around the world we must act decisively not incrementally support the sustainable aviation fuel bill but believe we have responsibility to make it strong bold and more target towards the fuel that will truly deliver net zero my amendment be practical proportionate and widely support they add not cost but clarity confidence and commitment to sector that need all three if we want to lead the world in clean aviation we must lead with action not just ambition call on friend and colleague across the house to support the amendment in my name and in do so to give ptl the foothold it need to take off in the uk sustainable aviation fuel offer we route to decarbonise one of the most carbon intensive industry and to secure the future of our aviation sector in way that be compatible with our net zero goal climate change remain the great challenge of our time it be an existential threat to we our child and our grandchild and every decision make in this house must be measure against the scale and the urgency of the crisis aviation while connect people and drive our economy be contributor to the problem in it be responsible for almost million tonne of equivalent to about of the uk total emission even as emission from other sector decline aviation share be project to rise to by that be not compatible with our net zero target nor with our moral obligation to keep global temperature rise below sustainable aviation fuel be not silver bullet but it be step towards address the challenge as someone who spend almost decade work in renewable energy have see how technology innovation and the public trust must work hand in hand if we be to make lasting progress in address climate change however with innovation must come accountability which be why have table new clause and these new clause would strengthen this bill and aim to make the transition to clean flight more accountable more transparent and yes more ambitious new clause would support the secretary of state to raise sustainable fuel target in any give year and introduce duty to consider annually whether the target should be increase the secretary of state would also be require to set out what step the government will take to make any increase possible in short to ensure that the government can not forget the target it would require they to revisit review and wherever possible raise their ambition for clean flight new clause would strengthen the parliamentary scrutiny it would require the government to lay copy of each annual report before parliament and share it with the relevant select committees in both houses mean proper oversight and public accountability progress must not just be make it must be see to be make if we be go to take the public with we new clause would build on that principle of transparency and public engagement require air travel provider to report annually on their sustainable aviation fuel in way that passenger and the public can actually understand too often datum about emission and fuel use be bury in complex technical report that mean little to consumer under this proposal airline would publish both the total amount of saf use and the proportion it represent of their overall fuel consumption the hon gentleman be give very detailed speech would he agree that we already have the annual carbon budget audit which look each year at exactly those emission and be what draw to our attention the growth in this sector and why we need to focus exactly on drive down emission from the aviation sector which lead we to the saf mandate do he acknowledge that we already have mechanism for this which have help we to get to where we be today with this excellent bill thank the hon member for her intervention she manage to make detailed speech sound like backhand compliment do not disagree with her point that we have several reporting standard and my only counter argument would be that do not believe there can be too much transparency if that result in information be present in way that give the public further clarity and put great pressure on any government to speed up the transition that can only be good thing those figure must be present clearly in format that be accessible and easy to find on website and in public material that matter because whether it be demonstrate that solar and wind power low bill that carbon removal technology will provide job or that sustainable aviation fuel can cut emission we must be transparent to build public trust and belief in what we be do the power in this bill to fund the strike price mechanism to levy fine on fuel supplier who fail to pay be all welcome but they must be match by equally strong accountability to this house and the general public the amendment have propose would ensure that the government be require to review progress every year to explain how target will be strengthen and to make transparent the actual use of sustainable fuel across the aviation industry will the hon member give way the hon member be just in the nick of time so will thank the hon member for give way would like to speak to his comment and those of the father of the house about the impact on consumer in committee the government make it clear that they be alive not only to the consideration of cost and the impact on consumer but to the extreme complexity of how aircraft logistic and fuel function across global market and how aircraft be operate on day to day basis that make some of these reporting requirement extremely difficult for airline to deliver we do not want to create burden of bureaucracy that drive airline away from sustainable fuel and back towards unsustainable pure fossil source support the government position that we should stay where we be and build process that provide accountability think thank the hon gentleman for his intervention be afraid that do not agree that increase reporting burden on industry be bad thing every industry will argue that reporting be onerous the liturgy start with water company company will hide behind not have to report on the need to move forward with technology be remind that henry ford once say if ask people what they want they would say fast horse the reality be that technology will be the route to our achieve our net zero goal and this be one step on that pathway will finish new clause and would strengthen this bill strengthen public confidence and demonstrate the uk global leadership and very much hope the government will support they that bring we to the front bench contribution call the liberal democrat spokesperson this have be an informative debate on all the new clause from procedural point of view we be happy not to push new clause to division to begin draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests with regard to the synthetic road fuel provide to for constituency surgery tour last year that be not strictly relevant to sustainable aviation fuel but want to be entirely transparent about it as have be throughout this bill passage may also welcome the new minister to his place he have big pair of shoe to fill and equally want to commend the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane we do not always see entirely eye to eye for the effort and attention he put in to get this bill through the house and to his other duty in the house begin with new clause which require the secretary of state to lay before parliament report on the economic impact of the act once it be in force this amendment go to the nub of what be important do the bill enable growth or stifle it do it support our world class aviation industry or go against it more importantly do it enable our constituent to do what they have always do and fly be that on holiday on business or to visit family and friend overseas or do it hinder they in do that and do it hinder our business in bring good in and out of the country by air new clause force the secretary of state to confront the reality of the bill on multiple front it cover the impact on the uk aviation fuel industry and the uk sustainable aviation fuel supply and the impact on small medium and large producer and potential importer of sustainable aviation fuel could the hon member clarify over what period the government would do the cost impact assessment if they be to do one do he agree that the transition to any new technology require significant initial upfront investment all the trillion dollar company in the world be lose million before they become profitable be grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention will come on to some of the technological point he make early which it may surprise he to hear that be incredibly sympathetic towards on the timescale he ask for think it reasonable that when new act come into force the government should review it on yearly basis at least if not more frequently to check that it be work the point he make be valid and thank he for it last on the list of impact cover by new clause be the impact on international and domestic tourism in the uk and passenger air fare we in this house can pass all manner of law and scheme and we can mandate new thing but their impact include on the wide economy matter review like the one propose by new clause would ensure that government of all political persuasion monitor real life outcome and if necessary tweaked provision or completely change course can not for the life of understand why any government would run scared of such clause it would help they govern well in the long run the hon member will know that country right across the world be move towards saf have he review they to understand what be unique about the uk that mean that we be vulnerable while other country be able to drive ahead be these country undertake the same bureaucratic review of their own legislation and which country be he model his approach on think it be necessary for any government to review the legislation they be pass to check that it actually work do what it say on the tin and do not negatively impact real people and business go about their day to day life if he have pay attention to the debate in previous stage of this bill he will know that support move to sustainable aviation fuel will come on to that shortly when speak about other amendment think as the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed do that some technology be superior to other when it come to power to liquid but the move to those fuel be very important we have to get it right if we do not and we do not make it affordable it will not happen commend my hon friend on his speech do he agree that the conservative way be to ensure practicality over mere ideology and consumer right over government imposition of control and regulation that can do serious damage to the economy and people livelihood be grateful to my right hon friend the father of the house could not have put it well myself it be essential that whatever measure on any matter be bring forward by any government be it the current government or any future government real people life and the cost base be review regularly so that we be not make people poor or stop people from be able to do what they want be it go on holiday travel for business or move good around with that come to amendment and the cost impact on passenger the amendment would require the designated counterparty to report on the impact of the revenue certainty mechanism on passenger air fare one of the most contentious area surround the bill and indeed the government whole approach to net zero be what do it actually cost real people the amendment seek to clarify that and it give the government the opportunity in theory they should cheerfully embrace this to lock in claim that they profess to believe namely that the bill will have an impact of plus or minus on air fare the previous minister repeat that statistic time and again on second reading and in committee the new minister have the challenge today of either stick with his predecessor assertion back the amendment and lock in protection for consumer or admit that this may well be more costly to air traveller it be worth note that during the evidence stage of bill committee none of the witness be willing to affirm the government figure in fact some note that the estimate price appear low for example jonathon counsell from international airlines group state we think there be potentially some element that have not be include in that calculation but per passenger feel quite low when you think the cost of the saf itself will be near to report sustainable aviation fuel public bill committee july consumer need peace of mind that the bill will not cost they dear and will not act as financial barrier to the family holiday or any other trip so failure to back the amendment can only mean uncertainty turn to amendment which be focus on transparency the amendment would require the secretary of state to set standardise levy rate payable by all supplier of aviation fuel that must be publicise by supplier of aviation fuel on invoice to their customer valero for example one of the world large renewable fuel producer have contact the opposition argue for the amendment say that it would offer workable solution it would support the development of new saf production without significantly impact the industry as whole the amendment would apply the levy equally to all jet fuel supplier provide fair and transparent mechanism for support the broad saf industry just this week have be contact by virgin atlantic which be argue that transparency safeguard must be in place to keep cost low for consumer as organisation include the international air transport association have highlight since the mandate come into effect in january fuel supplier have be add compliance risk premium to the cost of mandated saf contribute to the price of saf and double it for some carrier that be to cover the eventuality that they do not meet the mandate target and must pay the buy out price for any miss volume virgin atlantic have argue that to prevent saf price increase far the revenue certainty mechanism must have sufficient safeguard in place to ensure transparency over cost pass through there must also be transparent process for refund in the event of over collection and all revenue generate under the rcm should be ringfence rather than go into the general taxation pot amendment look at british technology and intellectual property it would require the designated counterparty to prioritise uk base technology when enter contract as say from the dispatch box on second reading there be historical reality that we need to confront and the amendment would stop history repeat itself the historical error that refer to be this great many project support by grant from the advanced fuel fund use foreign own technology it can not be right that the british state while argue for domestic fuel security fund overseas technology when we have incredible innovator and manufacturer right here domestic fuel security must mean domestic fuel ip manufacture and supply it be important both to develop uk market for saf esaf and local production as be provide for by the bill and the mandate and to support and encourage the use of home grow technology for the manufacture of those product that not only retain revenue in the united kingdom but leverage huge amount of revenue for future export through technology licensing the amendment tackle that head on and failure to back it would be failure to back united kingdom innovator lastly amendment be on technological choice it state the term under subsection must include requirement for the producer to consider the longevity of supply and relative environmental impact when prioritise between organic and synthetic derive sustainable aviation fuel solution feel incredibly strongly about this amendment it be on matter that have champion in this house for many year in the last parliament during my time on the transport committee and since july from this dispatch box the amendment be in the name of the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr holden and it be relevant to new clause and amendment in the name of the hon member for dewsbury and batley both of which have great deal of sympathy for government of all political persuasion have profess to be technologically neutral they seldom be there be natural tendency to pick winner and loser we need to look through that lens and ask ourselves what the bill be promote and use the lever of primary legislation to enable the disappointing answer to that be the potential to bring alive saf plant use technology that have already be supersede plant that would therefore be temporary at well step up something with no longevity and with an estimate build cost of between million and billion would be no small mistake power to liquid solution otherwise know as esaf or synthetic fuel liquid hydrocarbon literally make out of air and water be surely the well and sustainable future for aviation fuel we have debate on second reading and in committee about other solution can not imagine that anyone be ready to defend grow food to burn it but equally waste derive fuel simply be not sustainable in the long term solid waste be not readily available the primary source be local authority the majority of which be on contract with energy from waste facility and incinerator that have decade to run likewise be not sure there be enough chip oil in the country to meet our aviation fuel need that leave power to liquid solution and esaf many say that it be not ready some say it be too expensive but those of we on the public bill committee hear loud and clear from zero petroleum that it be ready to scale right now it just need the green light from the regulator and with scale will come affordability amendment be in many way light touch amendment to bring this debate to the fore it do not close down other technological route but force the government to acknowledge the risk both to the environment and in term of cost when choose contract under the rcm as other speaker have say the bill can still be improve urge the minister to accept the amendment which would improve the bill and to ensure strong and affordable future for sustainable aviation fuel in our great united kingdom before turn to the amendment before we would like to thank the many hon member who have make considered and helpful contribution this legislation have be long in the making and few have be more central in bring it to fruition than my predecessor my hon friend the member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane who would like to thank personally for his effort throughout the second reading and committee stage likewise would like to thank my hon friend the members for shrewsbury julia buckley for worcester tom collins for falkirk euan stainbank for sunderland central lewis atkinson for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for north west leicestershire amanda hack for norwich north alice macdonald for carlisle ms minns for harlow chris vince and for halifax kate dearden for all their work in committee it now turn to to pick up the task and continue the work on this piece of legislation that introduce measure to support the production of saf in the uk until now there have be consensus across the house about the need to act fast get it right and drive investment into the saf industry while ensure that fly remain affordable for the british public those priority and the central aim of the bill remain clear to create market for uk saf production to progress our aim of decarbonise aviation and to create green skilled job across the united kingdom first will turn to some of the point raise in the debate the hon member for didcot and wantage olly glover ask what plan we have in place to achieve our decarb aim through the mechanism in the bill uk saf production could account for megatonne of carbon saving by that provide an attractive business case for business to scale up their exist saf effort in the uk but it go far broad than that the government other priority around airspace modernisation low and zero emission aircraft meet our uk emission trading scheme and carbon offset and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia obligation and address the non impact of aviation will also be instrumental in this work the minister mention reduction of megatonne but what be that as proportion of the current emission no piece of legislation can deal with all the emission that we be face through challenge in the aviation sector that be why we have this comprehensive package of measure to make decarbonise aviation while allow passenger to fly at an affordable rate reality the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman speak with his usual fervent passion in support of his constituent the national wealth fund stand ready to encourage investor to join we in find long term industrial future for grangemouth stand ready to invest million once an investable proposition have be identify the hon member for richmond park sarah olney raise the unfortunate closure of vivergo the government have be work with the plant to understand the financial challenge that it have face over the last decade but would like to reassure she that we do not anticipate supply issue in bioethanol provision also thank my hon friend the member for worcester for his decided and confident support for the measure in the bill the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper say that the market be too nascent but encourage he to look at the detail of the bill he will see that that be exactly the problem we be seek to solve through this legislation by allow saf producer to scale at pace and pursue those innovative technology he also speak about britain as an aviation leader the rcm be first of its kind global initiative to allow saf producer to produce the fuel we so desperately need he also encourage to sort out decarbonisation challenge in maritime draw his attention to the fact that the uk government announce million of funding to decarbonise the maritime sector only fortnight ago my hon friend the member for derby south baggy shanker have jaguar land rover within his constituency and be passionate advocate for both the automotive and aviation sector there he speak about the urgent need to encourage people to fly to enable they to access the rest of the world to see their family and to pursue business opportunity that be something that we be passionate about championing through the bill the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor be pleased to see that the bill be support across the house can only hope that he be correct in his prediction we shall see note that there be no representative from the green party here today to focus on these important measure to decarbonise aviation hon member from across the house can take from that what they will the hon gentleman be right to outline the broad work that be require to decarbonise aviation include airspace modernisation but also to talk up our fantastic uk aviation sector and the hard work that it be undertake to pursue decarbonisation my hon friend the member for north somerset sadik al hassan point to the very important fact that we be endow with key infrastructure such as pipeline pioneer by firm like exolum the research facility in his constituency to which he point and the pioneer work of bristol airport we need to develop market to facilitate that infrastructure far the cut in emission through saf be an exciting proposition indeed there be number of government amendment that would like hon member to consider government amendment allow for levy regulation to require the secretary of state to assist the designate counterparty by collect information and share it with the designated counterparty it will also allow for the regulation to be use to impose requirement on person to provide information to the secretary of state it be technical amendment that will ensure that the information require to calculate individual levy contribution be provide at sufficient frequency while not create additional administrative burden for industry government amendment allow the secretary of state to direct government own company to provide assistance for the purpose of identify to whom revenue certainty contract should be allocate the allocation process for rcm contract will be fair and transparent to give confidence to any applicant in other renewable scheme contract allocation be often carry out through an auction process the allocation process for contract for difference for renewable electricity be carry out through the national energy system operator or neso which be an operationally independent publicly own body that type of approach to allocation may also be suitable for rcm contract so the amendment will allow the secretary of state to direct body like neso to support in the allocation process the final decision on allocation however remain with the secretary of state without the amendment the same allocation process could be pursue but that would need to be do on contractual basis through procurement process which would add unnecessary cost and complexity to the process the amendment avoid those unnecessary impact therefore commend it and all other government amendment to the house would ask that new clause to which be table by the liberal democrats be withdraw they be introduce in identical form in committee and my remark will closely reflect the point my predecessor make then the amendment seek review of the impact of the revenue certainty mechanism within the next month be afraid that that be not reasonable as the revenue certainty mechanism trigger only once saf be be produce and even at pace that be some year off it will take time to build saf plant initially start with contract allocation round with saf producer therefore we will not see sufficient development in the next month to warrant review of the impact of the revenue certainty mechanism agree however that it be important to have parliamentary scrutiny to measure the impact of the act and to propose action if necessary the saf mandate already include review clause to assess the impact of the statutory instrument with the first review schedule within five year that be in line with comparable scheme with regard to new clause can reassure the house that work be be carry out at pace across government on the future of our refinery commission separate report as the new clause propose risk delay to future decision and any subsequent benefit that may be realise overall we expect low carbon fuel production to support up to job across the country and to make contribution to the economy of up to billion by commend the minister and wish he well in his new role and in all that he do the legislation extend to scotland wales and northern ireland so what discussion have be take place with the northern ireland assembly to ensure that we can see its benefit to both employment and the wide economy in northern ireland the hon member raise very important point we need to ensure that the benefit of the act be feel across the length and breadth of our united kingdom and that include engage with our colleague in the northern ireland assembly turn to new clause we do not anticipate substantial impact on saf production in the event of decline in uk bioethanol production the bioethanol market be global one and we do not currently foresee any supply issue furthermore the recommendation in new clause be already under way and duplicate measure can already be find in the saf mandate in july total of million be award to project via the advanced fuel fund that include project that use bioethanol municipal solid waste and green hydrogen as feedstock among other source the chancellor also announce in the spending review that we will continue to support saf production throughout the spending review period the saf mandate also include formal review mechanism embed in its legislation with the first review schedule to take place within five year new clause would also duplicate measure that already exist in the saf mandate the mandate award more certificate per litre to saf with high greenhouse gas saving which will encourage saf developer to continuously improve on their greenhouse gas saving this will be monitor through the formal review mechanism with the possibility to update legislation as require hope that this reassure the hon member for didcot and wantage that in many respect the concern he outline be allay by exist measure in the bill therefore urge he not to push his new clause new clause table by the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden would require the secretary of state to lay before parliament report on the economic impact of the legislation within year of it be pass such report would not show the full economic impact of these measure contract will need to be negotiate sign plant build and saf produce and sell before economic impact be release transparency on report in relation to the act economic impact can be achieve through regular update to the house therefore do not see the new clause as be effectual if he wish to evaluate the economic impact of the rcm therefore ask he not to move his new clause new clause table by the hon member for west dorset edward morello would require the secretary of state to introduce regulation require airline to make an annual report on their use of saf both in absolute volume and as percentage of overall fuel use welcome transparency on carbon emission to help consumer make informed choice however we will be provide datum on the supply of saf under the mandate include what proportion of the total aviation fuel supply be saf furthermore many airline already provide public information on their decarbonisation effort and therefore do not believe this new clause be necessary and ask the hon member not to move it new clause and table by the hon member for west dorset and the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed respectively relate to power to liquid obligation on new clause the government have already commit to keep mandate target under review the exist legislation enable the secretary of state to amend obligation under the saf mandate subject to consultation with those affected and scrutiny by parliament allow amendment to the obligation without consult appropriate party could be detrimental to our shared ambition of increase the use of saf on new clause the legislation that give effect to the saf mandate already make provision for review no later than give that the mandate have be in place for less than month and the ptl obligation do not come into effect until it would not be helpful to review early than plan therefore ask the hon member not to move their new clause amendment table by the right hon member for basildon and billericay would put requirement on the counterparty to report on the effect of the introduction of the rcm on air travel price this be speak to by the shadow minister the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith the government be commit to deliver value for money in the rcm scheme by control the scale and number of contract enter into and through the price negotiate in each contract the impact on air fare be likely to rise or fall by less than the cost of cup of coffee the cost of the scheme and the impact on ticket price will be keep under continual review passenger should also benefit from the low price generate from the low project risk and reduce cost of capital for saf producer therefore the bill and the measure in it will not limit people ability to fly give that ask the right hon member not to move the amendment turn to amendment and table by the right hon member for basildon and billericay and to amendment table by the hon member for dewsbury and batley the decision on the specific of contract allocation will be make during the contract allocation process there will be fair and transparent allocation process that evaluate the key cost benefit and risk of each project that will be develop over the come month and will be subject to consultation with stakeholder these amendment would reduce the government leverage in negotiation by set criterion in advance and would likely reduce value for money in the contract sign which be sure all of we would seek to avoid therefore ask that these amendment be not move finally turn to amendment table by the right hon member for basildon and billericay in may the government publish the response to the consultation on fund the saf revenue certainty mechanism it confirm that variable levy on aviation fuel supplier would be introduce and this be include in the content of the bill the government plan to consult imminently on the detailed design of the levy but this amendment would pre empt stakeholder response which will be consider in any design decision therefore ask the right hon member not to press the amendment hope that my response have provide the explanation and reassurance that colleague be seek the bill be crucial step towards establish saf industry in the uk and drive investment growth and job across our great country once again urge the house to give the bill its full support mr glover be it your pleasure that new clause be withdraw beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause

come across defendant who know the criminal justice system well than their antecedent their list of previous conviction be page long show multiple stint in prison use to do both prosecution and defence and remember some defendant even share with their top tip as to what might be the strong argument for bail or the good mitigation point in sentencing because they have be through the process so many time also see offender sentence to custody for the first time take their turn in what be far too often revolving door of prison sometimes they be send to prison far from home it be so common to see offender lose family tie their housing their job and any sense of purpose after week month or year they would come out have achieve nothing often with little or no money no job and little confidence or self worth compliment my hon friend on her excellent speech do she agree that improve literacy in prison be powerful tool for rehabilitation and reintegration literacy equip prisoner with essential communication and comprehension skill lay the foundation for further education and vocational training by foster reading writing and critical thinking ability inmate become much well prepare for employment opportunity within prison and upon release that not only enhance their self worth and confidence but reduce reoffende by open pathway to stable work do she agree that invest in prison literacy be an investment in safe community and more productive life my hon friend make powerful point invest in education and work be key part of prevent reoffende frustratingly without rehabilitation the alternative be return to the easy path one of crime we then see the revolving door of prison take another turn without intervention one in two prison leaver reoffend within six month of release some of offending be reoffende and reoffende cost the uk an estimate billion per year commend the hon lady on bring forward this debate when hear what she be go to speak about want to intervene first because it be an admirable subject and secondly because fully support what she be try to achieve hope that the minister will come back to she along those line do the hon lady agree that rehabilitation must take place in prison that part of rehabilitation be about give the prisoner confidence that they can do something of value and worth and that training in new skill can do more for rehabilitation than group therapy session that be the way to give an ex inmate or prisoner the opportunity to do well and that be what we should be do it be not bona fide adjournment debate unless the hon member have intervene so thank he for his intervention and his insight fully agree with he as well as have see countless example of prison have not work have meet former offender who have escape the revolve door often through work many have story like mark mark spend year in and out of prison on five separate occasion but with the support of project call jericho house in derby he be now clean stable and gainfully employ the issue of work in prison be something we have consider on the justice committee separately have recently visit prison where have the opportunity to talk to prisoner do my hon friend agree that meaningful work in prison can not only erase the boredom that can lead to drug use but give prisoner skill that they can use to find employment when they be release from prison it enable they to reintegrate into society thereby reduce the risk of reoffende agree and want to see work in prison start as early as possible not just at the end of prisoner sentence but during it be proud to stand on manifesto pledge to get offender into work that offender should work be conclusion that be intuitively obvious to have be barrister and that be also empirically support rehabilitation without get into work be rare for those who have offend and consider the impact on the rest of we working be far well than sit in cell most day be grateful to my hon friend for give way and agree entirely with what she say about the importance of meaningful work or purposeful activity in prison on that basis do she share my concern that the court backlog mean that there be thousand of prisoner on remand who be not require to do purposeful activity and be often sentence to walk out essentially go back into our community without have have the opportunity of work in prison to help with their rehabilitation thank my hon friend for her contribution and for make that powerful point that be why the government be do so much to reduce the backlog work in prison also come with host of second order benefit such as improve prisoner behaviour filling skill gap and boost the economy do not underestimate the scale of the challenge in turn around our prison nor do seek to claim that we could get all prisoner in prison start to work tomorrow pay tribute to the work of our current home secretary who when justice secretary get to grip with the crisis she inherit of prison near to complete collapse over the year of conservative government prisoner participation in education employment and vocational qualification drop sharply as the previous government be come to their end his majesty inspectorate of prison condemn the appalling neglect of how prisoner spend their time far too many be lock in cell without meaningful activity in category prison closed prison but with low security than those in category or nearly quarter of prisoner report get less than two hour unlock each day my local woman prison be hmp styal and my hon friend will be aware of the clink charity which do work in develop people skill in hospitality its ability to operate in hmp styal collapse completely because as there be such shortage of prison officer the woman be lock up for so much of the time that it be simply unable to provide the service in other prison the charity be be force to retender for contract on commercial basis it be not for profit that be set up to do that work encourage the minister wonder whether my hon friend agree to review whether contracting in the ministry of justice be really work as we need it to in that regard thank my hon friend for her contribution there be some really fantastic work be do which will come on to and it be essential that we find way of enable even more of that because time stick in prison do not improve behaviour it make it bad in the last year of the conservative government we see assault on prison staff increase by the million investment in body armour and tasers announce by the deputy prime minister in recent week show that he be give prison staff the tool they need to do their job safely but anything we can do to reduce the chance of violent incident deserve our full support that include meaningful activity such as work in prison because those on the frontline in our prison system deserve our full support prison officer at hmp ranby tell what difference it make to the behaviour of prisoner when they be do work when their day have purpose as well as the improve behaviour that work for prisoner lead to nearly fifth of the earning of prisoner who work out of prison on licence go to the prisoners earning act levy which support victim of crime we have government commit to investment and reform and take long term view of what be need for justice system that work our minister for prisons probation and reducing reoffending lord timpson be businessman who throughout his career enable offender to turn their life around and break the cycle have seek to be candid about how bad thing be in some of our prison but also want to talk about some of the brilliant work already happen which can be build on and scale up praise the hundred of employer who be point the way forward in derby we have pennine healthcare an employee own medical equipment manufacturer and its successful experience of employ prisoner have lead to its long term vision for rehabilitation focus employment opportunity for itself and potentially across the sector pennine support release on temporary licence scheme be proud to welcome the former justice minister my hon friend the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin to its headquarters in derby go with he to hmp ranby to see where pennine be establish workshop which it call project phoenix it will operate as an extension of the derby site and it will also prevent manufacturing from be offshore to competitor km away in china it could not have be more positive about the motivation and work ethic of the prisoner work for it that be practical solution to meet some of the workforce challenge face uk manufacturing at time when many employer share with the difficulty that they can have in recruit people with the skill that they need it could create pipeline of train worker who can have job that they know how to do available to they when they leave prison the difference that could make to offender chance of avoid another turn of the revolving door of reoffende be clear be the parliamentary champion for the rebuilding futures alliance the rfa whose mission be to break the cycle of reoffende by create smart pathway into work often in rail the evidence be extraordinarily compelling in show that employment reduce reoffende visit his majesty prison in hatfield in my constituency have among the high number of prison in the whole country and it be absolutely amazing the governor there have be creative and innovative in his thinking about rehabilitate the prisoner work with tempus novo by bring that charity in reoffende rate have reduce substantially give people hope and second chance that be great for their family as well which we need always to remember and it make economic sense do my hon friend agree that the government need to get behind those kind of initiative to stop reoffende that be another fantastic initiative thank my hon friend for his intervention impressively some of the partner agent and partner charity work with the rfa have achieve reoffende rate of under be tell at hmp ranby that the most popular work with prisoner be for the rail industry though sometimes prison struggle to find long term rail relate work for prisoner the rfa be work to help address that that be particularly important in sector such as rail which really need more skilled worker and be anticipate to lose worker by the rfa have tracking system that allow it to see how prisoner and placement progress the prison reform trust report that for year his majesty prison and probation service have not publish figure on the number of prisoner work in custody due to the disruption to datum quality we need more datum and we need it to be track the hon member make an important point about datum colleague of mine say that when they visit prison they ask what the reoffende rate be and the governor could not answer because reoffende rate be not be track do she agree that if prison have an incentive to watch their reoffende rate they would be more keen to make sure that the rehabilitation programme make difference and that they be not see the same face time and again the hon lady make an important point that be one of the reason that the rfa have create its tracking system to have tangible evidence of the efficacy of the work that we intuitively know must be successful in prevent reoffende the business that have meet that be utilise release on temporary licence scheme or have workshop in prison often act from really strong ethic and strong sense of social responsibility there be also economic benefit and evidence clear business case for provide work in prison thank the east midlands chamber for its work with business in this area be tell by their chief executive scott knowles that those employer that can successfully navigate the administrative burden to employ prisoner or offer placement on temporary licence frequently comment that these member of the team rapidly become their most productive team member lot of the work take place in prison be not for the private sector at all some of the work at hmp ranby be for the public sector in range of thing include building bed locker and furniture for use not just in other prison but in the wide public sector that mean that it do not have to be buy in provide significant saving to the public purse as result the success of scheme such as those that have be mention and those at hmp ranby raise an important question how can we scale up the model across more prison and employer the goal should be to reach point where upon release prisoner can return to their community anywhere in the country and find employment that build on the skill that be develop inside completely agree that all the evidence point towards the need to invest in prison training and employment programme to reduce reoffende do so be good for society and for the public purse but do my hon friend agree that we should reform the system to support short more modular learning in our prison in line with the government approach to the growth and skill levy rochester prison in my constituency run successful stonemasonry course but the length of time it month make it difficult for prisoner to complete it due to short sentence prisoner move across the prison estate and early release thank my hon friend for her intervention have range of option for people be really important but she also make it clear that short sentence can prevent rehabilitative work be do which be why it be so important that we be try to move to presumption against short sentence range of thing can be do and there need to be co ordinate effort to ensure consistency and opportunity across the prison estate perhaps that could involve ask different government departments to look at the good and service that they procure from prison to ensure that there be that option or building on the brilliant work be do on procurement to ensure that employer who provide meaningful work opportunity to prisoner see the wide benefit thereby reinforce the government commitment to rehabilitation and reduce reoffende there be popular myth that the poor the quality of prison the great the punishment but that have be well test over the last year his majesty chief inspector of prison suggest not only that purposeless prison be harmful for prisoner but that that harm could extend to wide society we can not isolate bear or humiliate someone into be rehabilitate it be far well that they be able to make amend through work the idea that give more people perhaps people who have never have it access to good work might strengthen society come naturally to as labour mp because labour be the party of work without it boredom frustration and despair can thrive work in prison benefit prisoner yes but it also work for those who risk their life and their safety as frontline prison officer and probation officer it work for company and not just because they be keen to do their part for society it can help we to meet the skill challenge that industry face to onshore manufacturing job and to create more funding for victim through the prisoners earnings act levy job or jail if we truly want to break the cycle of crime and give people in my constituency of derby north and across the country the safety and opportunity that they deserve this be how we begin congratulate my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson on secure this important debate and on her fine speech we have know each other for many year and she be one of the good advocate have come across at the bar and now in this place she be ferocious champion of justice and social justice credit to the people of derby north and an asset to our politic it be particularly apt that she bring this vital issue to the fore as it deserve far more attention and while be in this role be determined to ensure that it receive it find employment after release be one of the most effective way to support rehabilitation and break the cycle of reoffende the evidence be stark beyond argument that have job reduce the likelihood of reoffende and give that reoffende cost the taxpayer around billion year get prisoner and prison leaver work be the right thing to do not only for individual and community but for the public purse as my hon friend have mention we be debate the sentencing bill in committee next week and hope that the whole house will support the government agenda of tackle reoffende through that legislation work in prison be vital because the argument for work in prison win both the heart and the head it be about self worth for the prisoner and worth for society as whole let we be clear that must never mean offender bypass punishment for the pain that they have cause victim but they should not be leave to wallow in prison indeed many have untapped potential that our economy desperately need as my hon friend set out that be why the government be commit to improve offender access to purposeful activity and to strengthen the link between prison and employer so that more people leave prison with the skill qualification and opportunity that they need to succeed must at this point pay tribute to lord timpson for his work before he be make minister in the justice department he continue to be fine advocate for this cause deliver skill and work experience to prisoner be not always straightforward it be right that draw the house attention to recent report from her majesty inspectorate of prisons and ofsted just passing time it set out serious concern about the quantity and quality of work and attendance at work in prison it be something that and the government take seriously the problem be difficult especially in the context of the prison capacity crisis that this government inherit last summer but that do not mean we should not strive to perform well the report only motivate and this government to do more want to look forward and set out positive measure that we be take to drive improvement in the short and long term to understand the need of prisoner properly his majesty prison and probation service be now make sure that every prisoner have an individual learning and work plan during their sentencing focus on their need which might include numeracy and literacy the hon member for colne valley paul davies be fine advocate on this issue he be do great work on it in pilot project that apply across the country we must ensure that qualification to improve inmate job prospect as well as work experience and vocational training be build into sentencing simply put these issue should be right at the heart of sentencing policy and sentencing at court it be wonderful to hear the minister lay out everything that the government be do to address what be happen in our prison wonder whether he will give consideration to my amendment to the sentencing bill which apply matter that be consider after sentence to prisoner who be on remand so that they can have the same access to work and rehabilitation programme rather than be release when it be time to be sentence because they have already serve their time and then go home without any support we will absolutely consider that amendment should congratulate she on her appointment to her role in the liberal democrats that point be make in an intervention by my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth although the remand population be too big we must ensure that inmate on remand receive the service that they need youth justice be also key priority for and this issue also affect the youth estate on recent visit to wetherby young offender institute observe brilliant work by teenage boy in what they call branch work on allotment help with the recycling learn to make honey and build garden for the custody community it be genuinely heartwarme and important work that these young offender be undertake as they reach maturity my only disappointment come when learn that only of the child in the young offender institute be able to access those facility we must do more to make sure that every single offender who can do so safely have access to the skill and training that they need early today be in birmingham to see the brilliant social enterprise skill mill meet three year old who be learn skill in construction recycling and agriculture those skill mean that they will have option when they reach the age of that they would not have otherwise have good work be happen good example on the adult estate be greene king academy at hmp onley what they call the hideout be replica of greene king pub that give prisoner real world experience in hospitality city guilds qualification and genuine job opportunity on release marston brewery have similar set up in the academy at the lock inn at hmp liverpool which equip prisoner with professional catering and kitchen management skill in fact must make sure that visit the lock inn as matter of urgency will tell my private office so graduate from both scheme have already go directly into employment on release so these initiative really be successful we have the datum but we need to improve it to ensure that the evidence base be there across the prison estate the future skill programme deliver vocational training base on employer and labour market need and requirement it offer range of sector specific skill training course with guarantee job interview on release build on that and to address hmip concern about the intensity of the work experience we be trialle new working week project in five category prison include hmp ranby which be aware that my hon friend the member for derby north visit recently it be just few mile from my constituency indeed drive past it on my commute to this place and will be visit it in the come month be just think to myself that there probably be stat that show that many prisoner with great respect this be not mean to be judgmental may not be able to read or write when it come to help they find job we have to create confidence in they and enable they to say can do that can learn to read and write and can then get job that be very basic thing but it be important maybe the minister could tell we what will be do on that that be not just about working skill it be about life skill social skill and be able to connect with the person next to they completely agree and it go back to the central argument that my hon friend the member for derby north make about the innate value of work labour members and be sure hon member from across the house believe that work be good thing in and of itself it be not just about earn salary to pay the bill though that be very important it be also about build life skill and have confidence so that when someone leave prison they can enter the world and be well citizen whereas too many leave as well criminal that must be at the heart of what this government do and it will be in addition release on temporary licence be an important rehabilitative tool that allow suitably risk assess prisoner to engage in work with employer in the community that provide people with the opportunity to build relationship with employer and boost their job prospect ahead of release good example of that be the work of prisoners building homes at hmp north sea camp where prisoner be train and employ to build modular low carbon affordable home in partnership with housing provider public sector body and third sector organisation as part of the justice committee inquiry on rehabilitation and resettlement we receive evidence show that rotl use have decline particularly since covid it have not really recover from that it be great to hear the good work the minister be outline on this but urge he to continue to push for great use of rotl because it could be key aspect of rehabilitation of offender go forward absolutely we will look at the evidence that the select committee receive and we be have those conversation all the time it be important to stress know my hon friend be very aware of this that in the first year of this government we have be deal with one of the most acute crisis across the public estate and that have clearly take up the bandwidth of the government and the ministry of justice because of the difficult decision that the last lord chancellor make we be now in position where hope we can do more on this the government have also launch regional employment council which for the first time bring together business prison probation and the department for work and pensions we have extend apprenticeship across the prison estate from the open to the closed estate at hmp highpoint five cohort of prisoner be begin rail apprenticeship this year this be model we want to expand far and early result be encouraging to help build on this expansion we have announce new foundation apprenticeship which be available to prisoner they be short course than traditional apprenticeship and can be access by prisoner up to the age of it be fine point make by my hon friend the member for rochester and strood lauren edwards about the length of course clearly too often prisoner be in and out for short period we want to try to stop that fundamentally or at least amend the framework in that regard but we have to have training and service for those who be in prison for short time to support prisoner in consider their long term goal we be deliver well career advice and guidance in prison from april this year we be roll out new national career information advice and guidance contract so that again every prisoner have access to consistent high quality career advice tailor to their need and critically link to real job opportunity take together employment hub employer partnership vocational training apprenticeship and the working week project represent initiative that be move in the right direction but want to be clear that we know that the situation be not good enough and that there be lot more work to be do once again thank my hon friend the member for derby north for raise this important subject which as say do not get enough attention hope to do my bit to change that this government be commit to rehabilitation to help cut reoffende hope that she will agree that the government have build solid foundation to stabilise the prison system after the inheritance we receive last summer and have launch important initiative in our first year in office but there be much more to do and welcome her support in drive forward this vital work in the month ahead question put and agree to house adjourn
