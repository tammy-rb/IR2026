escalation of the conflict in israel and gaza we be work with partner across the wide region urge all side to de escalate tension facilitate the supply of humanitarian aid and tackle all form of extremism we be all absolutely order member must sit down again once another member be speak we can not have two member on their foot at the same time we be all heartbroken by what be happen in the

government work to get hostage free will they also work for increasingly long humanitarian pause that can build towards just and last peace my hon friend be right about try to do everything we can in the region that be why send royal navy task group to try to de escalate tension include rfa lyme bay and rfa argus those facility along with other be do everything they can to help lower the tension and certainly act as deterrent and to ensure that we can get aid into the region he will be interested to hear that we have have tonne of aid deliver so far and there will be another flight later this month there be thousand of orphan and displace family amid an ongoing humanitarian catastrophe what be the government do to ensure that unrestricted aid be reach all the people who desperately need it and importantly to ensure that israel lift the siege condition as the hon lady will know we be in favour of see pause in the action some people know call for ceasefire but would point out that there be ceasefire on october the problem be that it be break by hamas who work this carnage on the middle east we be do everything possible to help get that aid in with the royal navy taskforce infantry and other personnel in the region we now have an uplift of about personnel in the wide region who be all help to ensure that we get the aid in and across the border once we have get it to the region itself welcome the defence secretary to his place behind hamas sit iran behind iran sit russia and increasingly behind russia sit china that be the geopolitical backdrop that will define the next decade with grow authoritarianism impact on our security and our economy be it now time to increase the defence budget to my right hon friend will know that we have indeed pledge to increase defence spending to as economic condition allow this year it will probably be around so we be make good progress prior to get this role talk about my own desire to see high defence spending because we be live in much less certain world with many more variable he be right to point out iran action with hezbollah in lebanon syrian militia in iraq and houthis in yemen very much drive the situation the reality be that neither the long term security of israel nor justice for the palestinians will be find through bomb and bullet as an international community we need to be do all we can to move to an endure cessation of the violence but while we be do that can the secretary of state say how the uk armed force will be utilise their capacity to help those get aid into gaza to get much big quantity in than be happen at the moment the hon gentleman be absolutely right about the uk desire to do that and have talk about how we have deploy large increase in personnel in the region to work with various government have personally speak to most of the middle eastern government and on those call the first thing they have do be welcome our deterrent and the fact that we have bring such large amount of aid now million to help the palestinians it be not just the hostage themselves who be be hold hostage the population of gaza be be hold hostage by hamas and therefore the solution be to deal with hamas themselves call the shadow secretary of state after nearly three month it be very good to finally welcome the defence secretary to the dispatch box for the first time he reflect the deep concern about the humanitarian catastrophe in gaza and the risk of wide escalation labour totally condemn hamas terrorism we back israel right to defend itself but require it to meet its duty under international law and lift the siege condition and we want to see the break in fighting extend to get much more aid in and the hostage out we back the military deployment to the region to support wide security but with attack against us personnel rise what action be the defence secretary take to increase protection for uk personnel in the middle east first mr speaker it be good to be at the dispatch box opposite the right hon gentleman thank he as well as yourself and other for their condolence when be not able to attend the first defence question in term of protect our own personnel have ask the chief of the defence staff to review their position make reference to the additional personnel who have move to the region but do not mention that several have be move to tel aviv beirut and jordan all with the aim of protect both british military personnel and british citizen in the region we keep that matter under constant review would the defence secretary agree that over the past decade there have be an international failure to pursue palestinian peace settlement and tackle the hamas threat middle east escalation risk be not mention in the government defence command paper update nor be hamas or palestine with threat increase be the defence secretary pursue that defence plan in full include further deep cut to the british army the right hon gentleman be right to say that nobody include the israelis see what hamas be about to do come that point to the need for much great surveillance but also much wide than that the need to pursue the two state solution which be official british policy and be something that the world must do as this conflict we hope come to an end the answer to the right hon gentleman question about be able to deploy british troop and indeed asset be that when ask the question the answer come back immediately yes we can do it and there be more that we could do should we need to be satisfied that we cut our cloth in order to react to event around the world which of course come on top of what we be do in kosovo and elsewhere we will certainly make sure that we maintain the resource to carry out those important mission service accommodation what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of service accommodation for armed force personnel what step he be take to improve service accommodation for armed force personnel currently of the service family accommodation meet or exceed the government decent home standard only those property should be allocate to service family the government continue to invest significant sum to improve the quality of uk service family accommodation the defence infrastructure organisation receive an investment of million over this financial year and the next as part of the defence command paper refresh mean that the forecast million for this year be more than double last year investment in maintenance and improvement the minister will be aware that this time last year almost home of armed force personnel be affect by black mould and damp which obviously include many property that have child in they year on too many of our service personnel and their family still have this problem no matter whether it be one house or house can the minister set out how he be go to tackle this problem quickly our armed force personnel and their family deserve well than what they have be get to date the hon gentleman ask an excellent question we be aware that what happen last winter be not good enough too many home be affect particularly by damp and mould that be why we have prioritise get the investment in and it have more than double in the current financial year be pleased to confirm to he that last week set out our winter plan it show that home in the defence estate would benefit from significant work on damp and mould which be about of the total number that require that work constituent of mine who live in clive barrack at tern hill in shropshire have report that he live in rat infest accommodation sometimes with two to six soldier live in the same room as result shipping container have be place in the ground about at the end of august and kitte out like budget hotel accommodation for those soldier to live in can the minister provide any reassurance that these servicemen will be provide with somewhere appropriate to live in the near future be obviously sorry to hear about that case would ask the hon member to write to with the detail and will look into it with the dio the key thing be that wherever we be talk about whichever specific barrack or base if we be go to get on with the work we need the money there and we have get that we have put in place the extra million and as set out in the winter plan thousand of force personnel will now benefit from that work the dio be not fit for purpose and the future defence infrastructure services accommodation contract have be disaster include completely unacceptable delay in issue and check gas and electricity safety certificate no private landlord would get away with this without be sue the secretary of state have good run out at the defence committee last week and say he be potentially look at radical reform in this area can urge the minister and his boss to do precisely that to honour our service personnel and their family in way they be not be honour at present be very grateful to my right hon friend he know that share his passion for see genuine step change improvement in our accommodation that be why we have announce the spending that we have on the performance of the contractor which the dio ultimately oversee one of the important aspect of the winter plan be significant increase in staff man the telephone service so that we see well service to personnel we expect the average waiting time for one of those call to go from seven minute to second it will be very important to service personnel that when they make those call they get answer in good time the minister may be aware that early this year one of the accommodation block in hms collingwood in my gosport constituency be shut down all together because it just simply be not fit for human habitation there be also some issue with the accommodation block in hms sultan could invite the minister to come to gosport to have look at some of the accommodation on offer for our service personnel it be simply not good enough and they deserve well would be more than happy to do so call the shadow minister there be new defence secretary but it be the same old story in service accommodation with report of broken boiler black mould leaky roof and painfully long wait for repair last christmas one service family tell that they go without working boiler for three week and be force to live in hotel over christmas and new year can the minister assure that no one who serve our country in uniform will go without heating or be force out of their home this winter because of the dire state of their military accommodation be grateful to the hon member and repeat the point we recognise that performance be not good enough last winter which be why the secretary of state make it an absolute priority to get the extra investment in have do that be pleased to say that the winter plan do include boiler and heating upgrade for about home armed forces non combat incidents and jurisdictional constraints what discussion he have have with his us counterpart on increase awareness of non combat incident and jurisdictional constraint affect the armed force defence ministers have close relationship with our us colleague and discuss such issue on case by case basis thank the minister for his answer it be fast approach the sixth anniversary of captain dean sprouting be kill in road traffic accident in while on operational duty by us servicemen the us guardsman do not adhere to any standard operation procedure or health and safety regulation drive unsuitable and poorly maintain vehicle on an unnecessary journey captain sprouting death be both avoidable and preventable and it would not have occur have the us servicemen involve adhere to the regulation despite the continuous effort of his widow linda for the ministry of defence to highlight the complicated jurisdictional procedure involve in blue on blue incident linda and her boy continue to suffer the consequence on daily basis what would like to ask the minister be give that the defence minister in the lords order think the minister must have get the gist by now and be able to answer with something interruption just to help the hon member for falkirk john mc nally have to try to get through list of what be mean to be question give he long time to ask question and it be not forthcoming if do not do this will not get through the other people who wish to ask question the hon gentleman raise very complicated case and the widow to whom send my condolence be obviously keen to see the matter resolve suggest that the hon gentleman and meet to discuss the issue in appropriate detail be happy to look at an adjournment debate if that help but we have to have short question to get other people in support for veterans what step he be take to support veteran what step his department be take to support veteran the ministry of defence deliver range of service to veteran and their family include the administration and payment of armed force pension and compensation and tailor advice and assistance through the veterans welfare service defence transition services and integrate personal commissioning for veteran when veteran and their family be compensate for the detrimental impact their service have have on their life that be unjustly class as income when apply for mean test benefit render veteran and their family ineligible for welfare support under uk government control the most significant of which be pension credit as result thousand of veteran miss out on almost every year will the minister pledge his support for the royal british legion credit their service campaign and will he work with the department for work and pensions and his other cabinet colleague to ensure that compensation award to veteran be disregard when apply for mean test benefit of course the mod work with the dwp on range of issue compensation be set in the full knowledge of how it will be deal with under the benefit system in the uk by most measure the armed force compensation scheme and the war pension scheme be feel to be sound and appropriate for award significant amount of money to those who have serve our country and who unfortunately have be disadvantage as result will my right hon friend join in thank the veterans charity in north devon for their poppies to paddington operation which see wreath from the great western railway region reach paddington for remembrance day and for their incredible work to help support our wonderful veteran across the uk absolutely will and add my congratulation to my hon friend in thank the veterans charity in north devon also congratulate she on the extraordinary support she give to our veteran in her constituency and elsewhere particularly as we come out of the season of remembrance which know you be heavily involve with too mr speaker it be important to reflect on those who give so much in the service of our country call the shadow minister over the past year the number of veteran claim universal credit have increase by which be nearly third do the minister recognise that the king speech fail to help veteran in receipt of universal credit to cope with the increase cost of living cause by his government economic failure and do he far recognise that some of the long term sick who his party have be attack in the medium over the last few day be veteran with physical and mental health challenge what advice have he give his colleague about the conservative party rhetoric and about lend their full support to our veteran and all those who have serve the hon gentleman will know that universal credit be an in work benefit within the system there be allowance that we offer to our veteran that can be improve as he know that be why we have institute the quinquennial review and the independent review of veteran welfare service which we will be respond to shortly trident nuclear programme if he will make an estimate of the annual maintenance and run cost of the trident nuclear programme the ministry of defence co ordinate range of interdependent programme to support maintain and renew the nuclear deterrent the expect cost of the combine defence nuclear enterprise will be set out at supplementary estimate in february the estimate cost of trident renewal stand at the moment at billion with furth billion earmark for contingency we know that containment of nuclear material be problem for the ministry of defence and we also know from recent report that vanguard class submarine nearly have collision over the weekend our party put in freedom of information request ask about transportation of nuclear material through scotland and that be rebuff the uk government may be content to play second fiddle to the us on weapon of mass destruction but can the secretary of state explain the lack of transparency on wmd movement in scotland and justify scotland be keep in the dark be it not time to abandon this costly and dangerous bomb and get it out of scotland for good order let we help each other to get through the list please profoundly disagree about this be the time to abandon the deterrent could not think of bad time the policy of the hon gentleman party be not just to abandon the deterrent but to withdraw from nato could not think of more reckless policy to undertake in the face of russian aggression we support the deterrent and we will continue to invest in it do the minister share my relief that both main party in the house of commons support the retention and renewal of the nuclear deterrent do he also share my relief that in july when the vote be hold on whether to renew the nuclear deterrent there be massive majority of in favour of do that that send message to the scottish nationalist about how unrepresentative their view be be extremely grateful to my right hon friend for that remark be delighted that those on the labour front bench show their agreement by nod when give my previous answer be delighted that there be consensus think we all agree that particularly at this time the country need the security of deterrent to deter what would be the most aggressive threat to our nation freedom welcome the shadow minister to her place may confirm again that labour support for our nuclear deterrent which we maintain on behalf of our nato ally be total however follow report in newspaper about malfunction depth gauge on vanguard submarine at sea can the minister explain what step he have take to ensure that such an incident never happen again first be delighted to hear confirmation of labour total support for the deterrent that send very powerful message to our adversary about our national endeavour to support the deterrent and its renewal on the specific story that the hon lady mention she will not be surprised to hear that we do not comment on operational matter in respect of our submarine call the snp spokesperson this one will break the convention let also welcome the secretary of state to their position the nuclear enterprise have an uncapped budget and after the demise of be the large single public procurement project on these island for those of we on the snp benches at least that be money spend on weapon system that be design never to be use which not only bleed money from the conventional mod budget but suck it from hospital school and social care on day when the preview of the autumn statement in the financial times read stagnation nation govern the uk when there be no money can the minister advise the house what step his department be take to ensure that there be no further cut to conventional force or elsewhere because of the uncapped runaway trident budget the hon gentleman talk about budget and cost can be open about the figure that matter million that be the combined death toll in the first and second world war we have not have third world war and we be profoundly lucky and put it to the house that it be not coincidence we know from the official history of the submarine service by peter hennessy and james jinks that during the transition to vanguard contingency be make in whitehall for the possible alteration of the continuous at sea deterrent to take account of the complete breakdown of one or more hull this involve dive polaris submarine into loch long to remain there on quick reaction alert can the minister advise the house on what discussion his department be have on the contingency that we now see arise from an almost year old vanguard fleet the hon gentleman too will not be surprised to hear that we will not comment on that other than to say that we have have continuous at sea deterrent since we should all be proud of that and be delighted to see that member on both side of the house who support our union also support the nuclear deterrent raf aid flight to the middle east what step he be take to increase the number of raf aid flight to the middle east what step he be take to increase the number of raf aid flight to the middle

airlift tonne of aid to the country as have say previously want to see an end to the violence in the middle east although acknowledge that neither israel nor hamas agree to an immediate ceasefire while negotiation to deliver an endure peace be ongoing we must urgently accelerate the delivery of aid via the raf to alleviate human suffering on the ground can the secretary of state explain why within two week of the earthquake in turkey and syria nearly tonne of aid be deliver there yet since the israel hamas war break out more than month ago only tonne have be deliver by the raf can the difference be war zone when say that we have deliver to the country mean of course to egypt from there we have to get the aid across the rafah crossing which for all the reason of complexity be not always open or available there be many restriction to get that aid in but be work very hard on that the problem be not lack of resource we have put in million more than double the exist million and can assure the hon gentleman that there be further flight leave later this month for more than month we have witness distressing humanitarian disaster unfolding in gaza it be welcome that the raf be fly uk humanitarian aid to the region but so far we have see only three raf flight when will the government increase the number of flight and the amount of aid give to palestinians who have suffer so much and who deserve at the very least the basic essential to try to survive the issue be not get the aid to the region we could fly more aircraft the issue be get the aid into gaza itself and in that regard we have the problem of hamas terrorist organisation not in the least bit interested in look after the citizen of gaza and of course the problem of the rafah crossing which be open and close on fairly arbitrary basis however can assure the hon lady that we be work very hard with all the different body and government in the region to get more of that aid in as quickly as possible the capacity

thousand of people have it not be for the support of the government of pakistan and we continue to enjoy their support and co operation in our effort to bring out many thousand more as the hon lady well know because it have be well cover in the medium the government of pakistan have seek to accelerate the deportation of those whom they consider to be there illegally but our excellent team in the

consistency of support the british government have show and the way they have lead our nato ally in support of the ukrainians right from the start how be we go to maintain that lead in the face of

continue to do so have visit ukraine twice this year host ukrainian family for year in my own home and the government have set up the british lead international fund for ukraine which be on its way to deliver think nearly million of support we have also be first with tank with ammunition with long range missile and with permission and we intend to be first with this war go forward it be vital that

evidence that the operational mod guard service employment contract have have material bearing on workflow recruitment and retention however it be not possible to conduct an accurate assessment of the impact that omec have have on application from staff seek promotion because of the way application be file that say the mod guard service be encourage by the volume of application receive for vacancy

observe the risk of escalation in the region to inform decision making in the uk mod and for nothing else be my right hon friend concern about the volcanic activity in iceland at the moment the regularly use keflavik airport near reykjavik could that be interrupt by the threatened volcanic activity to the relief of people everywhere hop for christmas getaway be tell that this particular

what they should do but sadly doubt that they be about to labour party research on waste in the ministry of defence show that over billion have be squander since so when be the government go to get

department have with the foreign commonwealth and development office and the israeli government about ensure that those donation get to those most in need not do so will only escalate the conflict as have describe it be complex position on the ground to get the aid all the way through but be happy to either meet or take detail from my hon friend to ensure that those donation get where they be intend defence ministers will be aware that the situation in kosovo be deteriorate dramatically can the secretary of state give we an assurance that the current international military presence there be sufficient to counter any threat from belgrade when the supreme allied commander europe ask we for additional support for the kosovo serbian border the answer be immediately yes that weekend and we have battalion there now which be do great job that have contribute to lessening of tension and we be keep close eye on it in our conversation to ensure that we do not see the situation erupt this weekend we witness the third attack in year on commercial vessel in international water the cargo ship galaxy leader have be describe by the israeli government as british own and japanese operate what action will the minister take to prevent such act of terrorism on british vessel we be very aware of the incident that my hon friend describe the us navy have presence in the red sea and the royal navy always keep under review option to deploy there too gurkha soldier who retire before receive low pension than other british soldier will the minister update the house on the current negotiation between the uk and the government of nepal to solve that difficult issue be grateful to the hon gentleman and be see bilateral committee with veteran and the nepalese ambassador on wednesday this be an ongoing process the hon gentleman will be aware that pension scheme be extremely complicated and in many case the gurkha pension scheme and offer to transfer subsequently represent good value for many of our brave gurkha veteran be certainly in discussion with the interested party be afraid that can not offer any promise at all but nevertheless discussion be ongoing the great south west region be home to cut edge defence company such as supacat which make military vehicle for our armed force the jackal be an incredible vehicle that be be put to good use in ukraine what step be my hon friend take to ensure that more defence job come to the south west it be brilliant to see south west colleague stand up for the defence sector in their constituency and my hon friend be right about supacat it be brilliant platform in february supacat be award million contract by the mod for high mobility truck vehicle to be deliver by the end of the financial year secure job in the uk supacat already have two other direct contract with the mod for the jackal military enhancement programme which be value at total of million we must ensure that putin do not win we must co operate and help with the reconstruction of ukraine be it not time that we start seize russian state asset to help pay for the reconstruction of ukraine long time ago when the war start be transport secretary we seize quite lot of yacht and aircraft which have still not be release to ensure that they do not benefit from their closeness to putin the hon gentleman be right that over time we must keep crank up the different way by which we ensure that money be not flow to that regime and we will continue to keep that under review believe that the ability to make virgin steel be crucial to the uk defence capability do my right hon friend the secretary of state agree my hon friend make an excellent point she have be long run champion of the steel sector and its importance to her constituent of course we want smooth transition between blast furnace and electronic arc steel make technology steel remain incredibly important to the defence sector take the type almost of that be british steel that be tonne per ship that underline why it be so important that in constituency such as my hon friend we continue to support the steel report november vol the secretary of state and his predecessor rightly call out the wanton and unlawful destruction of civilian infrastructure in ukraine home hospital and school why can they not show equal uproar at what be happen to civilian in gaza there be principle in international law that country can defend itself ukraine be attack for absolutely no reason whatsoever while we call on israel both privately and publicly to protect civilian in whatever way it can hamas be use civilian as human shield and deliberately use the infrastructure on top of they to hide behind would have think that the hon gentleman could see the difference do the secretary of state agree that it be vital that his counterpart in the us administration realise that if putin do not lose in ukraine the peace and security of the whole of europe be call into question so it be in their short and medium term interest to make sure that putin be see to fail my right hon friend be characteristically correct about this but would widen that point we be talk about the security of not just europe but the indo pacific and indeed the entire world putin must not win level up with permission mr speaker would like to make statement on level up this government be commit to level up and create opportunity across all region and nation of the uk last year we set out our levelling up mission in the levelling up white paper all principally aim at tackle regional inequality because we believe that people opportunity should be the same wherever they live be it in city or town on an island or in rural or coastal community be proud to say that since this conservative government have commit over billion of local growth funding to level up through the levelling up fund the town deal the uk share prosperity fund the future high street fund and much more we be regenerate town centre and high street improve local transport fund heritage asset and boost productivity job and living standard our recently announce long term plan for town be provide long term investment for town and the money be to be spend on local people priority we have launch our investment zone programme investment zone across the uk will grow key industry of the future and increase job that include west yorkshire investment zone announce early today which will focus on life science we have also make excellent progress on freeport all freeport in england be now open for business and we have announce further four in wales and scotland as level up minister have be lucky enough to see at first hand how we be use this transformative funding to unlock the potential of local economy and improve the everyday life of people across the uk we recognise the good that this funding can do so we have embark on an ambitious plan to simplify the funding landscape for local authority lead by my right hon friend the secretary of state our simplification plan describe how this government will deliver our levelling up white paper commitment to streamline fund in three phase of reform first there will be an immediate simplification of exist fund secondly we will establish funding simplification doctrine by which central government will abide finally we will implement further reform at the next spending review we have already deliver much of the first phase for instance we have give local authority great freedom to adjust their town deal future high street and levelling up fund project we have also invite local authority to become part of the fund simplification pathfinder pilot which will give they great flexibility to move money between different fund by increase local flexibility we will reduce bureaucracy and inefficiency within the delivery process the second phase of our funding simplification plan will see the government launch new funding simplification doctrine which will change how central government give funding to local authority it be clear that funding competition can drive value for money and help identify the good project for certain programme so we will continue to deploy competition where they make sense but we also recognise that bidding into multiple competition especially in parallel can place portionate burden on local authority the new government doctrine will therefore ensure that we consider fully the impact on local authority when design new fund finally we have commit to further reform at the next spending review include give our trailblazer mayoral combined authority in greater manchester and the west midland single department style multi year settlement of course our work to give local authority the right lever to spend funding efficiently be only one part of the picture of equal importance be the funding itself as mention early since we have make more than billion available to local place as part of that across round and of the levelling up fund we commit billion to project across the country we have listen to feedback from the first two round of the fund and my right hon friend the secretary of state announce in july that we would take new approach to round as result we decide not to run another competition for this round instead we have draw on the impressive pool of bid that we be not initially able to fund through round today be delighted to confirm the allocation of the levelling up fund third and final round we be invest billion in project across england scotland and wales copy of the successful allocation have be make available in the vote office the sheer number of high quality bid be testament to the enthusiasm for level up across our country and the hard work of so many hon member in support their local area to develop strong plan for renewal from chorley mr speaker to elgin and from doncaster to rhyl these local infrastructure project will restore pride in place and improve everyday life for local people we have target funding at the place most in need as identify through our levelling up need metric we have also ensure fair geographic spread across great britain include million across six project in scotland and million across seven project in wales that mean that across all three round we have invest more than billion in scotland wales and northern ireland exceed our original funding commitment it also mean that across all three round of the fund the north east and the north west will have receive more per capita than any other region in england they be follow closely by the east midland and by yorkshire and the humber our round investment double down on two of our key levelling up mission pride in place and improve transport but we also recognise the key role that culture play in level up we invest billion on project with cultural component in round and and as part of this round we be set aside furth million for culture project to be announce in due course we want to get delivery happen quickly we will work closely with local authority to confirm that their project remain viable and we will provide ongoing support to ensure that local place be able to deliver we be commit to give local area the funding and power they need to deliver transformative change within their community we have commit more than billion of local growth funding for community the length and breadth of our country we have invest in pride in place and reverse decade of decline we be take long term decision for bright future for our country commend this statement to the house thank the minister for advance sight of his statement start by congratulate all those area that have be successful in their bid include chorley mr speaker commiseration to all those area that have miss out once again although the truth be that even the area that have win will find that this money be drop in the ocean compare with the billion cut from local government funding since only six week ago there be report that council face billion shortfall in their budget for this year alone how do today announcement help they face that existential threat at least the government appear to have finally accept that local authority be force to spend disproportionate sum in previous round to get bid prepare although we appear to have lurch from one extreme to the other this time council have not be involve in any dialogue on the bid and be possibly not even aware that their bid be be consider will the minister tell we what discussion have take place with local authority before decision be make give that the proposal be approach be couple of year old what assurance will he give we that they still reflect local priority the government methodology note say the department cap bid for regeneration project outside priority area by local authority and region do any project that meet the department threshold not get fund for that reason and which one be they please do tell we what on earth be mean by funding simplification it an elaborate way of say sorry do it apply to all government spending decision or just to this department because it have so patently fail to get grip on spending that it have to have its own doctrine be it be do to address the concern of the national audit office and the public accounts committee that billion of pound be be waste because the department have engage in programme without any understanding of its impact as the ippr north say level up have be litany of miss deadline move goalpost and dysfunction although to be fair it could have be talk about any government project when it say that do the minister accept that the new approach announce today mean that the concern level against the department be in fact valid with this late iteration how do the minister expect anyone to keep up with what this government want when they flit around so much the prime minister announce five new priority this morning be the project select in line with those priority or will they all be change again to reflect this week prime ministerial thinkin of course where do this leave the hundred of project that still have not be successful there be no mention of any future round in the statement in fact think the minister say that this be the final round of bidding so where do that leave all the place that have be unsuccessful so far what be the plan to address those community that be crumble and those high street that be empty be this the end of any hope of level up for they even in those area that have attract funding we know that these crumb from the table be not enough to reverse year of neglect street that be once burst with pride be shut down rent be rise mortgage be soar and insecurity be still bake into the workplace tackle those thing would be genuine levelling up and labour believe in give those community the power resource and flexibility to tackle such issue in the way they think well that be true way of allow people to take back control the statement offer no path ahead to deal with those issue it just rearrange the deckchair of what have go before we have be leave with fail experiment an illusion that last as long as the press release it have not go unnoticed that the number of conservative mp stand down at the next election have go past they know that after year of stagnation they do not have record to defend they be not level up they be give up the hon gentleman misjudge the mood of the house he talk about local government finance last year we give local authority an uplift of more than billion he ask whether any project be ax by the methodology that we use no they be not as say we set out the methodology online and will ensure that there be copy in the house of commons library the hon gentleman ask what conversation there be with local authority ahead of any announcement we have area team on the ground in all local authority area which confirm with council that project be still priority they also confirm with council whether project could still be deliver by the deadline no project be identify through those conversation that do not qualify this time around far to that the hon gentleman ask about funding simplification and why we be embark on that he mention the nao concern some of its concern be legitimate but we look at its report and many of the figure date from march we have spend billion on local place since march we announce the funding simplification plan in july in response to the commitment we make in the levelling up white paper to simplify the funding landscape finally the hon gentleman describe billion of levelling up funding as crumb that say it all about the labour party it do not recognise the value of anything we be invest billion in local priority and labour describe that as crumb leave it to the house to determine what it think of that be well accustomed in this place to rejection and after round and of the levelling up fund it be disappointing not to see brixham and paignton recognise however be delighted today to see that brixham harbour and the epic centre in torbay business park have be recognise with million of support which will make huge difference can the minister reassure that that money will come in good time and good order so that we have the ability to deliver as quickly as possible in our coastal community absolutely we be delighted to be fund high tech fish and chip in brixham this announcement come on top of additional funding pot that we have be able to give torbay include the levelling up partnership on which be work well with my hon friend the members for totnes anthony mangnall and for torbay kevin foster the funding will come in due course and we will work with local authority to ensure that they can still deliver the project on time and to plan call the snp spokesperson some member may have an advantage on in that they have see the detail of the allocation which have be hand just this second so will give completely constituency neutral response to the minister statement however hard the tories try to hide the truth the fact be that these day the word most people will apply before britain be broken most people support genuine levelling up who could argue with when the prime minister constituency get more than the whole of glasgow last time around and when most people think their high street be get bad rather than well we have to ask what the real agenda be will the minister confirm how much of the money he boast have be commit since have actually be spend how do it compare to the overspend on for example the scottish government have decade of experience scottish government of various political persuasion by the way in successfully allocate eu funding for example in true partnership with local authority what discussion do the uk government have with the scottish government give their statutory role in culture and transport and their role in pride in place before he make today announcement what discussion do they have with the convention of scottish local authorities to get consensus view on what scottish local authority need or be this decision just be make by somebody in ministerial office in whitehall who be as out of touch with scotland today as they will be out of office next year the hon gentleman describe be out of touch with scotland he also mention glasgow should tell he that glasgow have receive million in this round so suggest that it be he who be out of touch with scotland the government have responsibility to all people business and community across the whole united kingdom across all three round of the fund as mention in my statement we have invest billion of levelling up funding in local authority in scotland wales and northern ireland the hon gentleman should consider his argument it seem somewhat bizarre that he be frustrate at the funding that we be spend in scotland he should focus on what the cash be deliver rather than on who be deliver it be thrilled that the department for levelling up housing and communities have fund the green innovation corridor in my constituency the government have invest ten on ten of million of pound in wolverhampton which be desperately need however speed of delivery be an issue will the minister meet to discuss how the council can be encourage to deliver the project quickly commit to meet my hon friend to discuss that matter she be fantastic champion for her constituent in wolverhampton which be key place where we be see level up in action include the relocation of dluhc office to wolverhampton be pleased that we have be able to fund my hon friend project in this round and be delighted to be work with she on it call the chairman of the select committee the minister have say lot about input but what be important in the end be output and the change that be make will the minister say which indicator have show reduction in inequality between the south east and the north since this funding begin and in particular whether the productivity gap have reduce at all finally be surprised there be no mention of the trailblazer project in manchester and birmingham and their roll out to the other mayoral combine authority understand that they will be roll out but with reduced power for the rest of the combined authority will the minister tell we exactly what the situation be please do not ask we to wait for wednesday statement read about it in the financial times on saturday and if the financial times can be tell on saturday be sure this house can be tell today be very grateful to the chair of the select committee as say in my statement across all three round of the fund the north east and the north west have receive more per capita than any other region in england he ask about the specific on productivity improvement and so on and will write to he and his committee about that regard the trailblazer deal have not read the piece in the financial times but will do so as soon as the statement be finish would encourage he to wait until wednesday the mid cornwall metro be levelling up infrastructure project to upgrade railway connectivity across cornwall it will bring huge benefit both economically and socially be pleased to hear the minister say that the government be keen to get on with deliver the project ask he to use his office to work with the department for transport the treasury and cornwall council to get the final business case over the line and the funding release so that we can get on with the project absolutely there be few great champion for cornwall in this house than my hon friend and shall work with he to ensure that the business case be sign off as soon as possible and that we be able to see level up in cornwall be delighted that will be visit cornwall in the very near future to sign devolution deal be not sure whether the minister live in some parallel universe but he come to the dispatch box today to talk about the simplification of the process process that both he and the secretary of state have be implement as though it be nothing to do with they county durham have one successful bid in the first round which happen to be in bishop auckland surprise surprise the constituency of the former levelling up minister in round durham county council be ask to put in bid and spend hundred of thousand of pound of taxpayer money do so once the bid be in it be tell that they would not be consider because it have have successful one in round will the minister compensate durham county council for the money it have waste not through its own inefficiency but because he seem to chip chop and change the rule when he like the right hon member talk about the process that be own by my department as say we be embark on this ambitious funding simplification agenda purely on the basis of some of the point that he have raise local authority member of this house and the select committee be concern about the number of competition that be involve in various government fund we be address that through our funding simplification doctrine the right hon gentleman talk about durham simply say to he that the international territorial level region for the tees valley in durham have receive eight project across the round of the levelling up fund that equate to per capita in the region which be one of the high amount would ask he to welcome that bolton be open its new million institute of medical sciences which follow an early million levelling up fund investment will my hon friend confirm that the late million of funding for bolton town centre for which be very grateful be not the end of his commitment to the people of bolton it could not be the end of the levelling up commitment in bolton because of the effort of my hon friend who work so hard for his constituent be delighted that bolton be receive money in this round and will work with he to ensure that level up continue in his part of the world in his statement the minister refer to scotland wales northern ireland the north east the north west the east midland and yorkshire and the humber there be no mention of the south west how can this conservative government claim that they want to level up community when conservative run devon county council can not even level up the pothole be delighted to confirm for the hon member that the south west region have receive project across the round of the levelling up fund to total value of million that work out at about per capita thank the hon member may warmly welcome the announcement of over million to regenerate gosport historic waterfront it will drive job attract visitor and drum up huge amount of economic prosperity for the area which have such rich cultural heritage but have be overlook for so long this excellent bid be of course submit under the previous conservative lead administration the council have since change hand and it will be for the liberal democrat leadership to deliver on it this be lib dem leadership that have already pay back million of brownfield land release funding to the government because it be unable to spend it what message do the minister have for the council to ensure that the money be spend in timely way to level up gosport and drive prosperity for the region be delighted that gosport be able to receive funding in this round the funding in gosport must be spend on the project priority the council be unable to reallocate that funding to some other random lib dem project that it have in mind it have to deliver on the priority that my hon friend mention there be an adjustment process that local authority can work on with my department to ensure that challenge around inflation for example can be meet however the project aim must still be meet and shall work with my hon friend and her local authority to ensure that they be can the minister confirm that rochdale receive no funding in this round in either path can he also explain to my constituent why even if we have successful bid which we would have welcome it would have be dwarf by the cut make to health education and of course our local authority those be the thing ultimately that be destroy the quality of life in my constituency would not accept the hon member synopsis as say early we give council an uplift of billion last year to meet priority in their area can not answer the hon member question today on rochdale but shall write to he as soon as this statement be over particularly welcome the million for the chambers institute in peebles the million for walk and cycleway in clydesdale and the million for transport in dumfries and galloway but pay particular tribute to the trustee of the annan harbour action group for its compelling bid which secure million to regenerate annan harbour these be all essentially rural project do my hon friend agree that rural area across the united kingdom must be at the core of level up there be no great champion for level up in rural area than my right hon friend be delighted that we have be able to give dumfries and galloway chunk of money in this round and be sure that he will work to ensure that his local authority put it to good use be delighted to be work with he on do just that confess that be very disappointed by today announcement because we have be try to get some money for the rhondda tunnel which would be an enormous enhancement to the top end of the rhondda fawr successive government ministers have tell personally that we should apply under round and then tell the local authority that it could not apply under round two be then tell personally that we should apply under round and now it turn out that there be no such thing as round so we never have an opportunity to make bid at all of any kind whatsoever be hopeful that the minister will now say that the government be not close the door on the rhondda tunnel and that there will be another chance for we to make an application to the government for the million that we need for one of the poor area in the country understand the hon member concern to be absolutely clear have not make any such commitment to he level up be an agenda that the government be focus on this be not the end of the road for level up and would be delighted to come to rhondda not least because rhondda receive money through round of the levelling up fund total of million the minister know full well how much bingley have be neglect and let down by labour run bradford council largely because keep tell he about it bingley need regeneration and it particularly need new swimming pool so can he tell what the government will do to help bingley receive the swimming pool and the regeneration that it desperately need be afraid that the people of bingley can not trust bradford council to deliver those for they understand the plight of the people of bingley because as my hon friend say he raise it with at every possible opportunity will work with he to see what funding stream be available to tackle the mess leave behind by labour run bradford council and to fund bingley swimming pool people in northern ireland will be angry tonight that not one penny of fund that the minister describe as create opportunity across all region and nation of the uk and aim at tackle regional inequality be allocate to northern ireland he give the flimsy excuse that it be because the northern ireland executive be not up and run the northern ireland executive do not have any input into the previous round and would not have have any into this round of course they would not even have need to seek new allocation because no new application be need be this not case of blatant pathetic transparent economic blackmail to try to get the assembly up and run again without address the reason why it fall and of pour the money into key conservative marginal constituency to bolster party support share the right hon gentleman frustration that we have be unable to fund project in northern ireland this time around as indicate to he that be because of lack of an executive in northern ireland assure he that we have set aside what northern ireland allocation would have be in this round and commit to work with he and his colleague to ensure that northern ireland receive the full benefit of level up thank my hon friend for his statement have lose my voice cheer for the million for swadlincote town this be the first time in year that government money have be put into regenerate that area which be the heart of south derbyshire and thank he very much indeed have have word with the chief executive of the new labour council and will sit on the board that ensure we have spade in the ground thank the minister very much be delighted to be able to give my hon friend constituency the funding this time around she be an extremely efficient champion for the people of derbyshire and be delighted that we have be able to fund the project can be one of this government sharp critic often justifiably but today thank the minister and his predecessor the hon member for bishop auckland dehenna davison whom harass relentlessly since the round two bid for denton be reject be so pleased that today destination denton the project that we put forward will receive nearly million give that be the constituency member of parliament and be involve in put the bid together what assurance can the minister give that will be involve in ensure that the project come to fruition be grateful to the hon gentleman for his kind word we expect local authority to work with their member of parliament who be key community stakeholder in deliver the bid project adjustment request process be available to local authority if project need to be adjust because of change in inflation and so on key thing that ask for be that members of parliament be consult in that process and will ensure that the hon gentleman be consult at all turn congratulate the new minister on the energy and purpose that he have bring to the vital task of level up the country and particularly small city and large town which be largely overlook by the labour government during year of focus on metropolitan city the million award to the greyfriars and eastgate project in gloucester will deliver new shopping centre indoor market and much more besides as well as put roof for the first time in year on the beautiful century greyfriars friary that will make huge difference alongside the king quarter project that have already be fund by the local council and the government do the minister agree that if the shadow levelling up minister the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders want to see an example of give up in this country he be welcome to visit the car park buy by previous labour administration for million and later sell for that be why gloucester like the rest of the country need to keep regeneration in the right hand gloucester could not have well champion than my hon friend he be fantastic champion for it when take on this job one of my first conversation be with he about the urgent need for levelling up funding in gloucester be delighted that we have be able to fund his project this time around as he say it be important that we keep gloucester in conservative hand my goodness what con this be early this year we hear from the national audit office that of the billion allocate in the first round only billion have be spend perhaps the minister can say how much have be spend now be this not much like any other tory slogan meaningless in reality once again there be nothing for ross skye and lochaber we hear from the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell about the importance of rural area but there be nothing for the portree harbour bid which would have make such difference invite the secretary of state and his ministerial team to my constituency we will drive around and look at all the site of the project that be fund by the european union road bridge harbour sport facility that money would have come if we have stay in the european union as scotland vote to do we be miss out on billion that the eu be invest in regeneration and once again we be get nothing zip from this tory government the right hon gentleman be wrong shall write to he follow the statement on exactly how much uk share prosperity fund his area have receive and hope that when do he will come back to the chamber to update the house on the fact of the matter he ask how much money have be spend since the national audit office release the figure in march billion have be spend since then but would be delighted to come up and visit the humble crofter constituency pardon for have an unfashionable thatcherite point of view but much well than government taxpayer fund levelling up be private sector level up although thank the secretary of state for have release some money for gainsborough million of private sector level up namely for raf scampton be at risk in my constituency will the minister meet after the court case to ensure that whatever its result we get on with level up for instance the roof of the officer mess alone will cost half million pound the roof of the hangar be decay the site will not be viable unless private sector investment be unleash and the home office get on with it would be delighted to meet my right hon friend but one of the key way to unlock private investment in the greater lincolnshire area be to progress with the devolution deal shall be delighted to meet he to discuss that far what consideration have the minister give to the formation of development corporation to deliver specific project as he may be aware represent durham constituency that include one of the poor community in the country there have be failure to leverage investment into the county most notably in round but also in round and to resolve some very serious structural problem can identify lot of problem in the abc street in easington and the numbered street in horden and peterlee town centre we have two very successful development corporation may remind the minister that durham be run by coalition of conservatives lib dems and independent that be fail to deliver hear the hon gentleman plea for more development corporation we be obviously on an ambitious journey with the north east to devolve far through the new mayoral north east combined authority that will be key way to help ensure level up in his part of the world it be welcome to hear the news about torbay today take the total regeneration funding available up to million which will hopefully be match by similar amount come in from the private sector we be of course in the process of negotiate the levelling up partnership and some of the scheme in that be now be deal with via the levelling up fund what implication be there for the levelling up partnership and will there be an opportunity to re look at other scheme that can now form part of it be grateful to my hon friend for highlight just how much levelling up investment torbay be get under this conservative government we be work with the local authority as he know on the levelling up partnership and with local members of parliament and key stakeholder project have be address by this funding today but we will look at other project to fund through the levelling up partnership it be deeply frustrating to hear the minister say that round be do by review round project which mean the pencoed level crossing in my constituency be reject again that mean my constituency have receive zero levelling up funding there be wide concern in local authority across the uk that level round which may not start until the next financial year will not have continuation of funding into because the minister have say that this will potentially all end in will he confirm that any project that start next year from round funding will be fund fully for completion of project even if it go beyond the minister confirm funding for will write to the hon gentleman on the specific of his question without read my note my understanding be that round have to be spend by the end of march but shall write to he to confirm after this session welcome the minister statement and in particular the million that be announce for halesowen town

deny today will be ringfence and what sort of timescale he envisage include without restore executive for spend that will there be fresh round in northern ireland or will it too be continuation of

number of time to reflect on the cost for local authority in come up with these bid and do not think that we have have an answer yet as part of his review will he look at those significant cost know that organisation in my constituency such as clyde gateway and south lanarkshire council spend huge amount of time expertise and money pull together bid which they then think be dead now they realise that the project have second chance will he think about the total cost involve and reimburse local authority for they be grateful to the hon member for welcome this funding be sure his letter to the secretary of state have key decision make role in that we be make capacity fund available within the department to help local authority where they come up against further challenge in the delivery of

the complexity of the current system of assessment of need try as might and have look at the white paper and various other document can not find single concise explanation could the minister write to and perhaps place copy of his reply in the library to explain how the current system have get we to this position would be happy to do that but we currently operate more than different local growth fund across different department think that demonstrate the complexity that local authority and other stakeholder community group and so on must navigate to try to get cash for their area that be why

tech and the digital economy and as one of the ministers with responsibility for the digital markets competition and consumers bill when be appoint last tuesday many helpful colleague come up to to say you have be throw in at the deep end but it be blessing to have responsibility for take this legislation through the house in that vein thank my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully for his tireless work to get the bill to this stage be aware of the importance of this legislation and the sentiment across the house to deliver the bill quickly the benefit of the digital market measure in part of the bill be clear to see they will bring about more dynamic digital economy which prioritise innovation growth and the delivery of well outcome for consumer and small business the rise of digital technology have be transformative deliver huge value to consumer and business however small number of firm exert immense control across strategically critical service online because the unique characteristic of digital market such as network effect and datum consolidation make they prone to tip in favour of few firm the new digital market regime will remove obstacle to competition and drive growth in digital market by proactively drive more dynamic market and by prevent harmful practice such as make it difficult to switch between operating system turn now to the government amendment when the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake first stand in the house he state that the legislation would unleash the full opportunity of digital market for the uk that intention have not change and our amendment fully support that the government amendment to part will provide great clarity to party interact with the regime enhance the accountability of the regulator and make sure that the legislation be draft effectively and meet its aim will address each of those theme in order this new regime be novel to maximise certainty it be critical that its parameter the scope of the regulator function and the right and obligation set out in the legislation be clear therefore the government have table series of amendment to far clarify how the digital market regime will work in practice the amendment relate to how legally bind commitment provide by firm within the scope of the regime will work in practice the digital market unit ability to amend certain decision notice and how in certain circumstance the dmu may use its investigatory and enforcement power after firm be no long designate two important set of clarify amendment be worth cover in more detail the first relate to conduct requirement consumer benefit be central focus of the digital market regime the dmu must consider consumer benefit when shape the design of its intervention to reinforce that central focus we be clarify how the dmu will consider consumer benefit when impose and enforce conduct requirement amendment require the dmu to explain the consumer benefit that it expect to result from conduct requirement ensure transparent well evidence decision amendment and simplify the wording of the countervail benefit exemption while critically maintain the same high threshold draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests let take the opportunity to congratulate my hon friend the member for meriden saqib bhatti on his appointment do he recognise that it be important to be clear and for the cma and the dmu to be clear that there could be conflict between the interest of current consumer and those of future consumer therefore it be important that the interest of both be balance in what the cma and the dmu eventually decide to do my right hon friend make an important point as make progress hope he will be reassure that the regime will take both those thing into account together amendment and will make sure that consumer get the good outcome amendment make an important clarification on the role of third party in the final offer mechanism process new clause and related amendment will clarify when and how third party may make collective submission in relation to the final offer mechanism that be vital as collective bargaining can help to address power imbalance during negotiation we expect that third party especially small organisation may seek to work together when negotiate payment term and condition my second theme be the accountability of the regulator the discretion afford to the cma and its accountability to government and parliament have form large part of the debate quite rightly during the passage of the bill will take time to address that the digital market regime be flexible in its design with the cma require level of discretion to deliver effective outcome while that be common for ex ante regulation that do not negate the importance of take step to maximise the predictability and proportionality of the regulator action for that reason the government be introduce an explicit requirement for the cma to impose conduct requirement and pro competition intervention only where it consider that it be proportionate to do so that will make it clear to firm in scope of the regime that they will not be subject to undue regulatory burden firm will be able to challenge disproportionate obligation and the competition appeal tribunal will in its consideration of any appeal apply the principle of proportionality in reasonable way as it always do to complement that and to ensure consistent senior oversight and accountability of the regime amendment to require enforcement decision include the imposition of penalty to be reserve to the cma board or its committee welcome my hon friend to his position and congratulate he on his role the government amendment relate to the proportionality test for conduct requirement why do the government feel that there be need for those additional test be there concern that the cma would use the power disproportionately and if so what might such use have be thank my hon friend for his contribution to the house on these matter and for that question the aim of the amendment be to provide clarity and give certainty clarity that we will always ensure that the consumer be at the heart of what we do and certainty because that be what business always need will happily give further clarity in my closing remark to ensure robust oversight of the dmu implementation of the regime we be also require that the secretary of state approve the publication of guidance relate to part of the bill on the issue of clarity the minister know that the final offer mechanism should be an issue of last resort and before that there should be mechanism by which negotiation can take place can he assure the house that there will be mechanism to ensure that big tech firm do not drag out negotiation unnecessarily because it be not clear so far the whole mechanism be design to ensure that small firm have say in this that be why the final offer mechanism be there hope that that that give the hon member some reassurance finally the regime have the potential for significant financial penalty to be impose so we have table amendment to allow any party subject to penalty to appeal decision about the penalty on the merit rather than on judicial review principle an appeal on the merit allow the competition appeal tribunal to consider whether it be right to impose the penalty and to consider the penalty amount where appropriate it also allow the competition appeal tribunal to decide different penalty amount join the queue of people congratulate the minister on his new role which be well deserved think that be right in say that any appeal against fine from another economic regulator such as ofwat or ofgem be make to the cma on the basis of the jr standard yet we seem to be create different and arguably more complicated special deal for large tech platform can he explain the government think behind that do not think that there be as my hon friend put it special deal it be about take balanced approach to ensure that firm with penalty decision that have less direct impact on third party have the opportunity to challenge they and take view on they accord to the regime the minister be be very generous just want to understand why the approach differ from that take in identical appeal by other company against other economic regulator give the huge size of the fine it be only right that that approach be put in place to ensure the penalty be apply appropriately but it do not apply to decision that be not make by the cma the regime have the potential for significant financial penalty to be impose so we be introduce amendment to allow any party subject to penalty to appeal decision about that penalty on the merit an appeal on the merit allow the competition appeal tribunal to consider whether it be right to impose the penalty and to consider the penalty amount where appropriate it allow the competition appeal tribunal to decide different penalty amount the dmu other decision include the decision as to whether breach of the regime occur would remain subject to an appeal on judicial review principle join in congratulate my hon friend on his appointment and on this very wise amendment it be fundamental to the rule of law that people who be fin large amount of money have some proper form of appeal we must not put too much trust in unaccountable and unelected regulator my right hon friend be always thoughtful contributor to debate in this house we believe that the amendment ensure consumer benefit be at the heart of what we be do and any appeal will be carry out appropriately adopt these amendment would bring the digital market regime into close alignment with exist cma merger and market regime where penalty decision can be appeal on the merit as in those regime all other decision be appealable on judicial review principle thank my hon friend for give way again he will appreciate that we be all try to get clarity so we understand what the proposal really mean in relation to the appeal standard that he describe for case that be not specifically relate to fine he mention the proportionality addition early in his remark when it come to an appeal be we right to understand that the question of proportionality apply when the cma originally make its decision to require an intervention and do not apply to the jr standard that be use to determine an appeal it be important to be specific about that because there be those who would argue that proportionality should be part of the appeal process think the government amendment say that proportionality apply at an early stage and that when it come to consider whether the cma have behave in proportionate way in make its decision the assessment will be make by the competition appeal tribunal on jr principle be right about that agree that that be exactly what we be say be happy to provide further clarity in my closing remark critical to accountability be of course transparency the government be commit to transparency and bring forward amendment that will require the cma to set out its reason for impose or vary conduct requirement that will improve transparency around cma decision making and increase consistency with other power in the bill where similar justification be require it also reinforce the cma exist responsibility to consider likely impact on consumer when decide whether and how to intervene the third theme be to ensure the legislation be draft effectively therefore we have table further technical amendment to ensure that the bill text meet the government original intended aim they relate to the scope of conduct requirement specifically the application of the materiality threshold contain in clause the maximum penalty limit impose on individual the merger report duty and the service of notice on undertaking overseas in certain circumstance it be worth note that there be small number of cross cut amendment contain in part and of the bill that will also impact the digital market regime want to ensure that there be plenty of time for hon member to debate the bill at this important stage in its passage appreciate collaborative approach from across the house be sure that there will be many different view on some of the amendment but look forward to constructive and collaborative discussion it be true privilege to be back in the chamber once again on behalf of the opposition to open the third debate in recent month on report stage of this incredibly important bill welcome the minister to his place he be join this brief at very exciting time and look forward to work with he in the month ahead to get the bill finally over the line pay tribute to his predecessor the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully we may not always have agree on the detail but be always grateful for his collegiate and open minded approach to get the bill to good place where it need to be speak on behalf of colleague across the house when say that the bill must be pass without delay and without significant change that would water down the provision if this be do well it have the potential to create world lead regulatory framework that will update and modernise the uk competition and consumer law by promote great competition we will finally address fundamental problem in uk market so that they work well for all consumer labour have long call for measure to protect consumer enhance innovation and promote competition in digital market in order to unlock growth and level the play field for small business that could not be more important in the midst of conservative cost of living crisis people often find it difficult to get out of internet provider contract they may spend hour on the phone or communicate via bot and when they do get through to someone that person try to talk they out of what they be try to do it seem to that it would be very straightforward to require provider to have on their website simple and prominent cancel my contract button easily visible to anyone who be log in that surely would save people acre of time and huge amount of frustration my hon friend have make an important point about an issue face by all our constituent who be struggle to get out of contract that do not give value for money and subscription trap which we will discuss later this evening these be issue that should have be deal with in the bill and could have be have it be afford parliamentary priority sadly many opportunity have be miss and will need to be return to and we will be urge the government to do that in due course the conservatives have needlessly delay the introduction of the bill their focus on infighting and general chaos have prevent they from present suitable legislation the bill be first promise in parliament more than year ago and since then owe to tory delay we have fall behind our european neighbour in this vital policy area failure to act against gatekeeper to access point in the digital economy from web browser to search engine and from mobile operating system to app store and broadband contract be have huge impact on business growth and consumer price let we be clear failure to regulate and level the play field be have huge impact on consumer who ultimately pay the price this be complicated bill which have rightly receive substantial coverage in the medium since it be first publish it be only appropriate for to begin my consideration of the first group of amendment by raise particular concern about the government amendment relate to the countervail benefit exemption notably amendment and as we all know the countervail benefit exemption allow the competition and markets authority to close an investigation of breach of conduct requirement if big tech firm can demonstrate that its anti competitive conduct produce benefit that outweigh the harm these amendment change the test for the exemption from indispensability recognise competition law standard that ensure that big tech firm can not proceed with anti competitive conduct without good reason to an untested potentially ambiguous standard there be danger that this new untested standard could allow big tech firm to evade compliance and continue with conduct that harm uk business and consumer they might also inundate the cma with an excessive number of claim of consumer benefit divert its limit resource away from other essential task the minister must be realistic it be highly unlikely that anti competitive conduct on the part of regulated firm will ever have consumer benefit the amendment create an unnecessary loophole that labour colleague and find very concerning would also be grateful if the minister could clarify whether these amendment create new legal standard that could allow regulated company to evade compliance there be also the question of how the amendment will protect the cma from be inundate with claim of countervail benefit from regulated company labour be concern by these amendment and therefore urge member across the house to support amendment and table in my name which seek to undo the government mismanagement will turn now to the change in the appeal mechanism the minister know about and will have hear the concern of colleague on the conservative side on all side actually about the change in the appeal process as outline in government amendment to we have all hear the passionate call from business that have risk their reputation and market share by stick their head above the parapet to warn of the risk of water down the appeal process it be testament to their hard work that we be at this point today as colleague will be aware the government amendment would change the appeal process and standard for penalty decision to full merit only as we know penalty such as fine be the most significant deterrent to prevent short message service firm from break the conduct requirement establish by the cma although timing key concern when consider the impact of full merit on other part of the bill be not of paramount importance when it come to fine it be foreseeable that full merit appeal could allow sms firm to reduce significantly the size of penalty thus reduce their incentive to comply the minister will come to learn that collegiate sensible agreement have be common theme as the bill have progress particularly in line by line scrutiny in committee indeed we broadly welcome the government decision to maintain the judicial review standard for appeal on regulatory decision labour feel that will ensure that the competition and markets authority have the tool to act and be not bogge down in complex lengthy and costly legal wrangling which would render the new regime completely ineffective however the minister must clarify how the amendment will not impede the cma ability to keep pace with rapidly move digital market the regulator must retain the flexibility to construct remedy that target the harm to uk business and consumer stem from big tech dominant position in digital market look back on the contribution of the minister predecessor in committee we be all assure with level of certainty that there would be no change to weaken the appeal process so it be frustrating reality to see yet another turn from this government sadly we have all become more than use to their slapdash way of govern and make law as we know introduce full merit appeal for all regulatory decision would have allow complex lengthy and costly legal wrangling which would render the new regime ineffective it must therefore be clarify that the government amendment allow full merit appeal only for the level of the fine and for the decision to issue fine it must not permit review of the cma decision to create conduct requirement or implement pro competitive intervention or of the cma decision on whether conduct requirement have be breach and how to remedy that breach would therefore be grateful if the minister clarify exactly whether that will be the case be conscious of time so will push the minister to clarify number of important point government amendment give the secretary of state the power to approve cma guidance which will be critical to regulated firm particularly on how they should comply with the conduct requirement place upon they what be unclear be when and how and in what timeframe guidance must be submit to the secretary of state know that many of we would be grateful for some straightforward clarity from the minister on that issue lastly be keen to highlight labour amendment to table in my name which aim to improve the consultation right of challenger firm under the current drafting firm with strategic market status will have far great consultation right than those that be detrimentally affect by their anti competitive behaviour the amendment would give third party the ability to provide critical information for the cma consideration and feedback on its work that be vital particularly for challenger company whose growth may see they capture by the regime at future point hope that the minister will consider the merit of introduce similar amendment in the other place he would have widespread support from colleague across the house if he be to go ahead and do so we have hear the concern of members across the house about how the change have be implement so urge the minister to listen carefully to the debate as it progress and to do the right thing by work collegiately for the benefit of good legislation in rise to address the house draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests be an independent adviser in collective action be bring in the competition appeal tribunal for alleged anti competitive behaviour relate to cryptocurrency although will not address my remark to any part of the bill that might be perceive as relevant to the funding of litigation relate to such action think it right to be comprehensive in my declaration wish to couch my remark in this way be firm supporter of the need to provide effective regulation in market that be vulnerable and some would say prone to monopolistic abuse of market power it be clear that regulation be not only desirable but essential when it come to represent the interest of the consumer and that be the place from which we all need to start in the sturm und drang that have accompany some of the coverage of the bill it be perhaps inevitable that focus have be place on the interest of one sector as oppose to those of another the large scale enterprise against the small start up in all that we risk forget the essential truth of why we be legislate in this way which be first and foremost to ensure that any regulator be work in the interest of the consumer my amendment deal precisely with that issue by impose an overarching and paramount duty on the regulator and indeed the court to serve the interest of the consumer accompany with duty of expedition that underline the thrust of why have decide to speak in this debate and to table amendment much need to be do in the process of deal with competition issue which of course mean the operation of the cma and the competition appeal tribunal this debate indeed this whole process can be moment for we to reflect and to take action and ensure that the way such dispute be deal with in future will be more efficient more speedy and in the interest of the consumer ex ante regulation be very difficult it be all about predict the future indeed be glad to see my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins in the chamber he follow that market very carefully and know its ever change nature it be difficult to predict what the world will look like in six month let alone in five year it be right to remember that the basis of the bill and of today debate go back four year to the furman review which rightly set out the parameter that have lead to the development of this much need legislation in one respect the review have be somewhat pray in aid in way that be potentially misleading recommend action of the furman review speak about the ability of an affected company to appeal decision this be relevant to amendment to clause the review state to facilitate great and quick use of interim measure to protect rival against significant harm the cma process should be streamline the ability for an affected company to appeal decision or an interim measure be vital safeguard of their right and check on the quality of cma decision making appeal process need to strike balance between protect those affect by any unjustified decision and ensure that cma power can be exercise effectively to protect those who would be leave expose by underenforcement or undue delay it go on the competition framework would be improve for digital market by focus appeal on test the reasonableness of cma judgement that procedure have be appropriately follow and that decision be not base on material error of fact or law standard more closely relate to that of judicial review as read it that be an invitation to ensure that there be not completely unbridle merit base approach it be world away from suggest that somehow in this world of ex ante regulation we should be immediately narrow down the option of any court or applicant relate to potential claim on merit ex ante review work be not easy but it be not unprecedented in united kingdom regulation we have have telecom regulation for long time with the work of ofcom in police that in that area for long time the decision making and the appeal process be allow to be base on merit before reversion or narrowing down to judicial review principle indeed that be lay out for long time much long than the period envisage in my amendment in order to reflect the importance of achieve maximum clarity as early as possible do not want to see anything that create uncertainty in this market because that will lead to lack of investment and perhaps reduction of the sort of investment that we want to see domestically and internationally in this important and vital market for the future of our british digital service industry my right hon and learn friend be make an important and eloquent speech can emphasise the point that he make about certainty and return to the intervention by my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright about the importance of have clarity on what the test will be and at what stage it apply we all understand proportionality test and we certainly all understand classic judicial review test but it be important in this emerge market that people know at which stage which test apply appreciate the minister say that he will clarify that later in his speech but be not sure that the wording propose by the government give we that clarity will my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland consider what more need to be do around that what my hon friend outline be precisely what we be seek in make these argument we be not in some way the friend of big tech we be not here to represent particular sectoral interest my amendment be draft by and by senior counsel from monckton chambers include philip moser kc who regularly appear both for and against big tech in these matter think it right to seek some independent pro bono advice on the operation of competition law to make sure that in develop the law in this way we do not create entirely untested mechanism that would guess litigation to clarify the point be that we should be seek to minimise more interpretive language that will require to be test in the court that be why take slight issue with what be say by the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones whom respect very much in amendment seek to replace the word indispensable with necessary because think that be much clear term that everyone would understand and that would in itself be high threshold for the affected company in demonstrate consumer benefit in the countervail consumer benefit test think that rather than try to use and develop new language we should look back and learn from the experience of telecom regulation one of the problem in in effect hand considerable power to the new digital market unit be that the legal landscape relate to this activity be unformed unlike the landscape that underpin the competition act we do not have the advantage of year of eu and uk court interpretation that be then apply by guideline issue by the cma the right hon and learn gentleman be articulate in present the case and knowledgeable about the issue but may distil it down to an issue of fairness that everyone can understand before our very eye the landscape be change long establish title newspaper and publication be disappear and retrench thousand of journalist be lose their job be it not matter of basic fairness that people who create the content should be properly compensate the hon gentleman be right to make that point that be why in other jurisdiction we have see agreement reach between big tech and newspaper title to ensure that there be that element of fairness agree with he want to see similar fairness and equity apply across the market what and other who agree with be try to do be to ensure that in create this brave new world of energetic and efficient regulation we do not as parliament upset the balance by give too much power to particular regulator lot of we in this place have watch with concern the failure of other type of regulation in our water industry or our energy industry for example do not think anybody would deny that at time we have get regulation wrong that be why it be important that we have this debate there be people outside this place who have put pressure on we by say the bill be in perfect order there be no need for you to look at it any more great mind have think about it say to they that it be for this place to make those decision do not look kindly on comment make by the chief executive of the cma about the merit of what this place be consider while the bill be in parliament absolutely accept the independence of the cma and the important role that it play but we should not confuse independence with lack of accountability that be point that will warm to in little while when address the relationship between regulator in this case the cma and parliament at the moment that relationship be wholly inadequate be make the point that unlike the competition act there be relative lack of work out court interpretation of this bill subject matter that have lead to distinguish commentator no less than sir jonathan jones former treasury counsel make the point in evidence to the committee that in effect the dmu would be able to decide who be go to regulate set the rule that apply and then enforce those rule the phrase legislator investigator and executioner be use while that be colourful language perhaps too colourful for dry debate about competition law it be important that we reflect on the view of that former treasury solicitor and be very careful that in go down this road we be not make false comparison lot have be say about ofcom and its decision and comparison have be make but we must not forget that those ofcom decision be heavily govern by eu framework directive article of that directive say that on ex ante telecom appeal member states shall ensure that the merit of the case be duly take into account and that there be an effective appeal mechanism that be bit different from the provision in the bill simple jr type review be precisely that and no more listen with interest to the intervention make by my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright who make really good point that need answer we need to understand where proportionality come into this if the principle of proportionality be be use in the first instance that be all well and good but we need to understand how that fit with the provision of the bill whether it imply that the court deem every decision make by the dmu to be proportionate or whether there be way to challenge particular decision by say that it be not make accord to the dmu own principle act in proportionate way it seem to would be interested in my right hon and learn friend view that on the basis of the government propose wording it be more likely that firm will be able to challenge whether the cma have apply its proportionality test appropriately but the mean by which it will do so will be under jr principle on appeal rather than on merit basis it be not that proportionality be not subject to challenge but that that challenge be limit by jr principle at the appeal stage do my right hon and learn friend agree that be what we need to bottom out the primary worry that lot of we have about the jr principle be that it mean that any challenge will probably be vanishingly small which be not good for ensure that the regulator be work in the good way none of we want to encourage incontinent litigation or incontinent legislation bear in mind the importance that we place on it but sometimes challenge be essential to create great certainty there will be ambiguity there will be occasion where there need to be test we should not be frightened of that be follow what my right hon and learn friend say carefully do he agree that we have to consider the nature of this business landscape for these firm some of the big company in the world litigation be cost of do business their track record show that they use almost all ground there be to challenge any decision make by any regulator not even regulator be resource sufficiently to be able to contest those challenge and the people who seek to bring they know that they will take year and cost huge amount of money and that the business may even be close by the time resolution have be find fully take on board my hon friend concern he be right to say that which be why this should not just be about what might happen in term of raw dispute it have to be the culture of the new regulator to work with any potential subject any company that might be subject of an investigation in co operative way that raise the issue of how open the party be with each other about the basis of their assertion and of how datum be share that go right into the competition appeal tribunal itself lot of people would be surprised that the disclosure rule in the cat be not as open as one would expect they to be if one be challenge decision we have to work our way through that in order to change that attitude and reduce the amount of potential litigation by make sure that there be agreement accept that the government have move on the jr test with regard to penalty but potential problem could result from the government amendment on that there will not be change of culture there will be readiness by big tech to admit breach and then all resource will be throw into contest the penalty there we will get the litigation the real argument and the high stake money to paraphrase my hon friend we will get the actuarial calculation that it would be worth throw lot of money at litigation to reduce penalty that could be big percentage of turnover we be potentially talk about huge penalty for these company that issue do worry and hope that it demonstrate to the house why be properly sensitive about the need to make sure that we do not just open the door to abuse by another mean be huge follower of theodore roosevelt and great believer that his approach to fight the morgans and the standard oils of his day be exactly how we should operate in the monopolistic market of today and tomorrow my hon friend be right to say that this market be fast develop when the furman report be produce we be look at different world in big tech with the rise of artificial intelligence we be see it evolve far be grateful to my right hon and learn friend for give way particularly as we be on the subject of theodore roosevelt do he agree that we have to be careful when consider consumer detriment in this case the argument be not successfully make in the united states that morgan could say that he may have railway monopoly but the ticket price be relatively low and so there be no consumer detriment that be not consider to be bind argument so because the cost of an app in an app store might be low that do not mean to say that the company can get away with overcharging again be grateful to my hon friend he be right there be danger that in regulation we focus on the cost of the good or service rather than on the overall environment and quality of the market some would say that that have be particular issue in the way that regulation have operate in the water sector that be why this be good moment for all of we as house to pause and reflect on where we have go wrong with regulation in the past and how we can get it right from here on in there be some option the government can look at when deal with the jr standard have mention the importance of make sure that there be accountability but we should not just be look at the sunset option that have set out in my amendment we should look again at whether the clarification of the proportionality test could help everybody to understand precisely how the jr principle will work if we miss the opportunity on this occasion to get this right be not sure we will be do anybody any favour least of all the consumer and especially not the dmu itself which need to develop in way that be truly accountable the thrust of some of my amendment relate to the regulator accountability to this place which be why they include requirement to report regularly to parliament and to ministers new clause relate to the appointment of the senior director of the dmu which think should be do directly by the secretary of state that be not challenge to the independence of the body minister regularly appoint independent director and inspector for example and it do not undermine the integrity and quality of their role however through those amendment be seek to make the case that we should not confuse independence for lack of accountability do not use that word as way of avoid great accountability to this place that be why when it come to how such regulator will be accountable to parliament we should strengthen our own scrutiny it be matter not for the minister but for this place to amend standing orders to create either committee of this house or perhaps joint committee to summon regulator directly to account such committee could have power akin to those of the public accounts committee to allow the director of all the regulator to answer to member of parliament and to peers support select committee focus on that work could really make difference and improve the quality of that regulation that be something urge not only on my hon friend on the front bench but on the business manager who might be listen and the leader of both houses as matter of urgency in this session they should come forward with proposal to amend the standing orders to create such scrutiny structure will briefly deal with the other amendment table in my name in this part order have to get five more speaker in plus the minister as the right hon and learn gentleman will shortly have be on his foot for nearly minute this be just quick reminder that he need to give other time to speak of course have just clear my throat madam deputy speaker and by my standard this be very short speech will deal in summary with the other amendment what be seek with those amendment be to ensure that in use definition we do not end up create mission creep for the dmu want the dmu to focus on the emerge digital economy do not want it to end up deal with for example supermarket such as tesco which will increasingly use online service to allow customer to shop do not think that be the intention of those propose the bill but we need to make it clear in the bill that that sort of mission creep will not be part of how the regulator develop also want to make the point that when look at entrenched market power focus purely on size can sometimes be deceptive rather small enterprise can often have disproportionate effect on market they do not necessarily need to be big while we rightly understand that generally the big the entity or organisation the big the impact it have it be not always the elephant that make difference it be sometimes the mouse that be why focus on market power rather than size be well way of deal with effective regulation in summary want to hear from my hon friend on the front bench response to the challenge that have lay out do not seek to press the amendment to vote this evening but be sure that they will be return to in the other place surely it be in the interest not only of the people we serve but of the wide british economy that in pass such pioneer legislation which in many way put britain in different place from other jurisdiction we do not end up disincentivise the sort of investment that know be part of the prime minister aspiration to make this country world leader in artificial intelligence and machine learn safety and place where digital business will want to invest it be as simple as that that be why it be vital that in this bill we strike as perfect balance as we can because in this complex ever change market it be very difficult to predict what the future will be call the snp spokesperson my party broadly welcome the bill at its introduction and through committee and broadly speak we still do however for our liking there remain too many gap in consumer protection the bill do not include an equivalent to the eu consumer right to redress when consumer be mislead and it do not baseline the protection that we have previously which we think be serious omission many consumer find that to their cost when their travel arrangement go haywire through chaos at the channel port over the summer the bill do not do enough to tackle greenwashe as we have hear there be systemic failure to tackle drip pricing and subscription trap we be also still unclear about how the government intend to tackle the scourge of fake review although secondary legislation could be introduce the scope of the sanction that could be bring to bear against the perpetrator would inevitably be restrict rather to my surprise we have government amendment to the bill that seem rather lot to be bring in it can be gently elide over that this be government who have be listen carefully to all the argument put but to be perfectly honest think it show that this have become something of christmas tree bill it would have be well to have have much more parliamentary scrutiny in committee of some of the thing we now find come in no matter how well intentione they be number of amendment to the bill do cause concern include the series of amendment that change the mechanism for appeal the competition and markets authority decision in our view government amendment and will water down the bill effectiveness allow tech company describe under the bill as the most powerful firm and dynamic digital market to be able to challenge the cma decision if they do not believe that they be proportionate government amendment to and also have that effect since they will prevent certain appeal by big tech firm of decision make by the cma from be hold to the judicial review standard be unpersuade by the argument that we have hear so far about that we fear that in practice when decision be take that be not for whatever reason to the liking of big tech company with rather large budget to take one entirely at random we have apple which make profit and turnover yield that be big than most country gdp they will inevitably be able to tie those decision up in the court for quite some time all the while be able to secure whatever advantage they have which the cma have judge they get unfairly the cma have warn that change the appeal mechanism could lead to such set of draw out legal battle and quite an adversarial relationship with the firm that it seek to regulate which would venture be far remove from the bill original intention it be unusual that should ever pray in aid the other place in political argument but last month the house of lords communications and digital committee call on the government to maintain the jr standard for all appeal it be therefore worrying if not entirely surprising that the extensive lobbying that some of the big tech company have subject we to seem to have find the ear of the government if the uk government amendment and which seek to allow firm with strategic market status to appeal against cma decision be accept that will essentially undermine the cma job and ability to protect consumer those amendment would allow big tech firm to appeal against decision take by the regulator on significant issue such as block merger and issue fine simply on the basis of their feeling that they may not be proportionate as say they can certainly afford to spend huge amount of money on legal representation to quibble with these decision particularly if the fine or deprivation of the opportunity to make lot of money mean that they feel it be worth spend that money whatever the eventual chance of success be this be in addition to the letter that baroness stowell write to the pm last month warn that the uk government must not undermine the competition and markets authority note that these amendment would favour those with an interest in delay regulatory intervention and give great power to avoid scrutiny to the tech firm with the great resource the uk government should not be ignore these warning and we believe that this be detrimental addition to the bill this position be also back up by which in april last year in our view these amendment show that the government have do the exact opposite of stick to their gun on this be mindful of the time as be you madam deputy speaker so shall come to the amendment that believe we will be vote on later labour amendment and would enable the competition and markets authority to consider any significant benefit due to combination of factor that might result from breach of the conduct requirement we think that strike reasonable and fair balance on where we would like the outcome to be and should the amendment be press to vote the snp will be support they listen to this debate be remind of remark attribute to major united states tech investor who say that it have always amuse he that people think competition and capitalism be the same thing while competition can be great driver of economic growth the acquisition of capital and the creation of new market there be equally plenty of capitalistic enterprise that have grow wealthy on the back of lack of competition through market domination that be why this legislation be so important superficially it be tempting to look at the landscape of the digital economy and say that the fact that there be number of very big company be evidence of effective competition between those company those company include amazon apple google and meta may compete for the provision of some service but they largely dominate market where they be the central player we have hear throughout the passage of the bill that even major business seek to sell their good through say amazon as an online retail platform can not afford to have public dispute with that platform because their relationship with that company be fundamental to the success of their business major publishing company have talk about the fact that contract renegotiation with company such as amazon can come with big cost attach but that ultimately they have to do business through they cloud storage which be currently an area of investigation for the cma be go to be vital piece of business infrastructure for anyone who operate in the digital economy but again it be dominate by one or two company principally google and amazon there be only two operating system for our mobile phone device one be android which be own by google the other be apple ios system they both have app store and there be lack of interoperability between they we therefore have app store market that be actual monopoly this have be investigate by the cma and it have billion of pound of consumer detriment in overprice and variable pricing attach to it we know that these anti competitive force exist in its recent ruling on the propose microsoft activision merger the cma be right to highlight that if company that create video game that people like to play be ally to cloud system own by dominant company people might only be able to access the service if they pay that cloud provider the storage gatekeeper or guardian of that service which could have consumer detriment down the line we be already see example such as market domination and self preferencing google have be investigate by the european commission over self preferencing this be where company be not just create an easy to use service across multiple product for people but do so in way that exclude other from that market in the long run we must be concern about the consumer detriment of market power be consolidate into the hand of relatively small number of company an example that member will probably all be familiar with be the mobile mapping app market it use to be quite vibrant market with number of player in it but it be now largely dominate by two google and apple that be not to say that the interest of company be always against the consumer interest but we should be mindful of the fact that in many of these market monopolistic condition can easily be create so we should be concern about abusive market power there be already some evidence of that we also need to be concern about the likelihood of litigation be cost of do business as say early to my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland because that have be the track record of the market so far the information commissioner have be challenge consistently by tech company when it have give datum notice we need to be concern too about the challenge from company to online safety legislation in europe where the digital markets act be new we already see legal challenge and appeal on the designation of gatekeeper status for some big company last week both meta and tiktok state that they be seek to challenge the european commission on the designation of some of their service as gatekeeper service so we already see evidence of the challenge that be likely to come we have see it in the past so we should be mindful of the impact now that be principally why want to speak about proportionality which have be raise and be very important if company challenge the conduct requirement impose on it by the regulator or the regulator decision on proportionality ground what could that include do the cma merely have to demonstrate that it consider the proportionality of its action as my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright suggest think we would recognise that as be similar to the judicial review requirement or would there be ground for challenge whether the regulator have consider all the information it should have consider when reach its decision if conduct requirement be set because the regulator believe that consumer detriment arise from company behaviour could the company say well yes but the price be still very low or it be not clear what the cost to the individual consumer will be so we challenge the ground for that action in this country we do not have culture of class action law suit so one of the big complaint in the tech sector be that what often stop an individual or business take action against big platform be that even if it win it would be after lengthy legal process and the damage win would be so small that it would not have be worth do typically we do not really allow class action law suit here but they would allow different kind of approach an organisation would be able to seek redress on behalf of large number of consumer the question of how the proportionality test will be apply be very important for understand how the measure will work it will widen the ground for litigation considerably if we allow proportionality to be interpret more widely if it be not simply question of whether the cma have do what it be require to do and if the test effectively allow for through the back door an on the merit appeal process in which any number of factor can be consider that may have be think important when decide whether an action be proportionate that be particularly important up front when the regulator be set the conduct requirement as we already see in the european union the early decision will be challenge by company they may consider the cost of litigation relatively small price to pay and think that they have relatively little to lose that have certainly be the experience so far we could end up with system that quickly become unwieldy where the incentive for the regulator to take action be limited it will not have the resource to fight robustly every challenge bring it will probably decide in advance not to pursue the action because of the cost of litigation that could come back its way that be why the minister and the government be right to resist the call from many of the big tech company for full on the merit appeal system which would have bogge the whole thing down in litigation it be important to understand the government intention in introduce the proportionality test fundamental principle of proportionality apply to all eu law in this case we be write the principle into the bill obviously the eu proportionality test will no long apply here so what be the intention behind introduce such test what be the certainty we seek to give can we be absolutely certain that there will be no unintended consequence and that the test will not be use to widen the basis for appeal give that so many factor could be consider in fairly subjective test of proportionality be the definition clear enough and proof against abuse so we can be confident that the judicial review standard not wide on the merit system will be the basis of appeal too welcome the new minister to his place and congratulate he on his appointment we all recognise that this be important long overdue legislation so wish he well in pilot it through the house also declare an interest be co chair of the all party parliamentary group for the national union of journalists receive no pecuniary advantage directly or indirectly and the nuj be not affiliate to the labour party or any other party but it none the less make some valid point which wish to raise today we face immense challenge and significant technological change in the uk and indeed globally give the development of social medium and the increase use of artificial intelligence in an era of fake news there be few source of news trust more than our national regional and much love local title which have stand the test of time and have deep root in our community have participate in number of debate on the subject in westminster hall and debate on the decline of our local newspaper and the need to support they be always over subscribed it be important to be aware that professional journalism in the uk be in crisis reach plc the publisher of title include the mirror the daily star and the manchester evening news have announce third round of redundancy put at risk as many as journalist job if we do not find mean of fairly compensate establish publisher and trust source of journalism we will suffer from less diverse medium landscape job loss and the promotion of voice deliver fake news guide by hidden agenda big tech continue to exploit its market dominance in digital advertising it use news content from professional journalist without give any payment or compensation to the publisher who produce the content this bill be positive step which welcome it be welcome by the nuj journalist and publisher function media market require regulator to address the power imbalance that have emerge between major tech company and the journalism industry in recent year our establish news title and publisher be essential to democracy they scrutinise government and contribute to an informed society their content be be use to generate revenue for tech giant they the creator must be guarantee fair share of revenue without quality news content on online platform the overall standard of information that we all consume will decline it be in the collective interest of our government of all citizen of the country and even of major tech company to ensure the continued presence of quality journalism that be relevant to the part of the bill that allow the competition and markets authority to initiate final offer mechanism which be refer to by my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones support opposition amendment and for the reason she give the final offer mechanism must be use only as last resort and not by big tech company to bypass meaningful negotiation also wish to reinforce the point make by my hon friend the member for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey meaningful and fair negotiation be vital if big tech company be not to continue to exploit the current power dynamic and place undue influence on small publisher in way that do not recognise the true value of the original content that they produce british journalism be valuable and its value be quantifiable news content use by tech giant be estimate to be worth around billion year in the uk that revenue be essential to the health and wellbeing of professional journalism in the uk welcome the stance of the house of lords communications and digital committee on the timely implementation of the bill and its recommendation that the government resist pressure to weaken some of the bill measure also echo what the nuj and the news media association say about maintain the option of judicial review for appeal against regulatory decision government amendment must be clarify number of member include my hon friend the member for pontypridd have ask for this to ensure that the competition and markets authority can retain the flexibility to construct remedy for problem that arise and to keep up with rapidly change digital market especially when big tech have such monopolistic position urge the minister to uphold high threshold for exemption from penalty when tech firm breach the rule so as to prevent misuse of exemption provision by well fund company that employ expensive legal team the example of everton football club come to mind it seem to not that be an expert in these matter that it be be heavily penalise other football club in the premier league that seem on the face of it to be guilty of far great abuse have manage to avoid the penalty it be crucial that we eliminate loophole that could be exploit by big tech whether we like it or not people consume lot of their news from the big tech giant research conduct by ofcom find that facebook be the third most popular place to consume news high proportion of people go there than to the bbc or sky news channel meta recently discontinue facebook news in europe and that have potential impact on news consumption with almost half of news consumer rely on social medium it be imperative to ensure fair compensation for quality content on social medium platform look ahead the nuj seek extensive engagement with the government hope that the minister will respond to this on safeguard the future of journalism and on recognise the multi faceted threat that it face include from emerge technology such as artificial intelligence it be imperative that this legislation quickly progress through parliament so that we can safeguard the integrity of uk news title and publisher and protect they from undue influence from big tech lobbyist who wish to water down much need reform be delighted to support the amendment in the name of my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland it be important to get the balance right and not to worry too much about phantasm and fear that will not arise it be worth recall that in the the federal trade commission be on the cusp of open an investigation into ibm for its monopoly in typewriter technology be change so rapidly and an over zealous regulatory mechanism be more likely to damage and hold back innovation than advance it think of the name that have come and go over the past few year who now have blackberry we once again think of blackberry as fruit rather than mechanism for communicating or nokia telephone in the nokia make wellington boot it be probably now back to make they as its telephone have come and go and be overtake that be the thing about the sector that we be look to regulate there be competition in it it be not necessarily competition for market share at any one time it be competition of technology that be evolve fast than people be able to deal with it there be in the bill touching faith in the competence of regulator which do not share the cma to which we be about to give significant power have make fool of itself this year and not just little it have be make global laugh stock by its microsoft activision blizzard ruling in which it blunder it get it wrong all the other regulator in the world do something else and the cma have to back down the story be this be quite important that the cma be do the work of the ftc but the ftc have to meet high legal standard and therefore encourage the cma to make the bid more difficult because it think that the uk law would be easy to work around than us law that be why the amendment on the judicial review standard be so important would be in favour of full merit standard think it be very peculiar that the opposition who be always happy to go to court to obstruct the government at any opportunity to obstruct the government in carry out the will of the british people or to obstruct the government when decision be make by accountable ministers want unaccountable unelected bureaucrat to have arbitrary power which do not want they to have want they to be able to operate accord to merit what do those at the dmu have to fear be they quiver in their boot that incompetent decision will be overturn surely they should have faith and confidence in their ability to do thing properly and competently because if they do they well they will not lose there be an argument that the law be complicated yes of course the law be complicated so do we just hack down all the law and give arbitrary power to whatever regulator because when we go to court it be difficult and expensive the fundamental protection of free democratic society be the rule of law however it be suddenly think that because the tech company have bit of money though other in this field have some money too they should not have the protection that the rest of we feel entitled to rely on think this be bizarre way of look at thing and it be why think the protection should be proper and full love these company no more than anybody else it be quite an interesting conundrum that all the company we use every day google apple and so on be not belove by their consumer but be remarkably useful we seem slightly to be legislate on the basis that though they be useful they be just little bit vulgar and therefore we should be little bit snooty about they let we not be because they bring enormous benefit to our consumer to our constituent who be consumer they make life easy and more efficient and they give they the opportunity to do thing more productively and to do thing they be not able to do before yes because they do that and they provide this service they make some money at the same time be therefore very supportive of the amendment of my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon new clause and be very important because they bring accountability to the regulator and want to ensure that regulator be accountable both to ministers and to parliament it be worth bear in mind that whenever regulator get decision right it be the regulator virtue and worthiness that be praise and hold up however whenever regulator get something wrong it be the fault of the treasury bench as well as warn those on the treasury bench warn those on the opposition front bench who hope one day in the far distant future probably beyond my lifetime to be hold office that at the point at which that sad day may come they will realise that they want to get the credit for what work not just the blame for what fail that be important for all government at all time and currently we have delegate thing to all of these random body and when they bungle it be the ministers fault anyway that be why we want to have such accountability there be also what would call the tesco amendment the tesco amendment be one about which my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon and have write to ministers to say that this bill as it be currently phrase would allow tesco to be designate tesco be not by and large digital company but it have lot of digital activity people may buy their bake bean or their bath oliver biscuit from tesco online and that potentially bring tesco within scope we have have marvellous reply from the department and look at my right hon and learn friend as say this predate my hon friend the minister who do not think would have sign such letter the marvellous reply say do worry because the cma and the dmu will do this we may be give they the power but do worry your little head about it because they will do it that be bad legislation or bad structure to legislation surely we have learn in this house and let we hope that the other place have learn if we have not that when we legislate what we put in law be what we think may happen we do not put thing into law that we do not want to happen in the hope that somebody out of good will will not use that power that be bad legislation and it simply should not be in the bill an amendment have be provide and if it be not accept tonight it should be accept in the other place it fascinate after the labour party have have go at the government for sitting end early that there be only one back bench speaker from the labour party the hon member for easington grahame morris on bill run to hundred of page interruption this be so important when we be scrutinise legislation we have already have three speaker from the government benches but it be the job of the opposition to hold the government to account it be not for government back benchers to hold the government to account it be for the opposition to do so on bill of this importance only one opposition back bench speaker very admirable and very diligent one it have to be say have want to come and diligently go through it which be what we should be do interruption be that sign from the hon member for hove peter kyle on the opposition front bench madam deputy speaker we will need to pass around the smell salt if this sort of thing carry on on report we need to be go through the amendment one by one look at the detail of the bill and amendment the tesco amendment do exactly that it be look at flaw or lacuna in the bill and try to close that hole that lead to the construction of well legislation which will have well effect in the court overall think we need to make sure as my right hon and learn friend have say that we put the consumer first and foremost it should all be about that there be huge competition in the tech sector not just on market share but on the fundamental of the technology that change and evolve in way that leave company that do not keep up out of business that be not like supermarket whose share may go up or over year this be about go from have the predominant market share to hardly exist as company that be how rapidly the sector have change over recent year and indeed over recent decade so we should not be too worried about lack of competition however we should always be worried about the difficulty of the over mighty regulator that be unaccountable to this place or to ministers that be why have put my name to my right hon and learn friend amendment and why urge the government as this bill progress to keep on think hard about why we should put faith in regulator to have any low standard than full merit for any review because surely the rule of law require that people interest be properly protect and that they be not subject to arbitrary law the liberal democrats welcome many aspect of this bill we be pleased that the government be finally act on the competition and markets authority recommendation in bring forward measure to prevent the tech giant from put our digital sector in stranglehold we want to see thriving british tech sector in which start up can innovate create good job and launch innovative product that will benefit consumer strong competition framework that push back on the tech giant dominance be essential for that for too long small number of big tech firm have be allow to dominate the market while small dynamic start up company be too often drive out of the market or swallow up by the tech giant new rule design by the cma will ensure that these large company will have to refrain from some of their unfair practice and they give the regulator power to ensure that the market be open to small challenger company the liberal democrats be pleased to see change to the competition framework which will allow the cma to investigate the takeover of small but promising start up that do not meet the usual merger control threshold this change be particularly important for sector such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality while they be in their infancy the benefit of these change will filter down to the end user the consumer in the form of more choice over product and service well price and more innovative start up come to the fore while we be glad that most of the cma recommendation be in this bill we have concern about certain aspect such as the forward look designation of sms firm and the definition of countervail benefit that sms firm be able to claim the countervail benefit exemption allow the cma to close an investigation into conduct breach if an sms firm can demonstrate that its anti competitive practice produce benefit for user that outweigh the harm there be some concern that big tech may seek to exploit this exemption to evade compliance with conduct requirement and continue with unfair anti competitive practice it could also create scope for tech firm to inundate the cma with an excessive number of claim of countervail benefit divert the cma limited resource away from essential task amendment table in my name seek to strengthen the bill and to curtail the power of large tech firm to evade compliance by tighten the definition in the bill of what kind of benefit be valid the liberal democrats also have concern about several of the government amendment particularly those relate to the appeal standard as they risk water down some of the cma most powerful tool there be now real danger that powerful incumbent will use their vast resource to bog down and delay the process leave small competitor at disadvantage these amendment show that the government be take the side of these establish firm at the expense of small grow firm and at the expense of economic growth and innovation as whole the liberal democrats be keen to ensure that big tech be prevent from put the british tech sector in stranglehold we hope that the government will be robust on the defensive measure in the bill it be important that they reject any attempt to water down or weaken this bill with loophole and that they ensure there be no ambiguity that could be exploit although competition be crucial for britain tech sector we hope the government also move to tackle some of the fundamental issue hold it back such as the skill gap the shortage of skilled worker and weak investment with the leave of the house would like to address some of the point that have be make today be grateful to member across the house for their contribution to this debate and of course throughout the development of this legislation be similarly grateful for the cross party support command by the digital market measure member will find that agree with point raise on both side of the house and be confident that this bill address those point thank the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones for kindly welcome to the treasury bench for her amendment and for her commitment to get this legislation right she ask about the countervail benefit exemption and reassure she that the wording change maintain the same high threshold sms firm must still prove that there be no other reasonable practical way to achieve the same benefit for consumer with less anti competitive effect this make sure consumer get the good outcome whether through the benefit provide or through more competitive market the hon lady also ask about appeal and it be important that decision make by the cma can be properly and appropriately review to ensure that they be fair rigorous and evidence base we have consider strong and differing view about appeal from range of stakeholder and judicial review principle be the appropriate standard for the majority of decision under the regime as we have maintain with the additional clarification on the dmu requirement to act proportionately we have however align the appeal of penalty decision with appeal under the enterprise act so that party can challenge these decision on their merit to ensure that the value of penalty be suitable penalty decision have less direct impact on third party and the amendment will provide additional reassurance without affect the regime effectiveness the significant change we be make will provide more clarity and assurance to firm on the need for the dmu to act proportionately they also bring the regime in line with the relevant cma precedent party will have great scope to challenge whether the intervention impose on they be proportionate or could have be achieve in less burdensome way when financial penalty be impose party will have access to full merit review to provide reassurance that the value of the fine be appropriate the hon lady also ask about the implementation of guidance and can assure she that we be work at pace to ensure the regime be operational as soon as possible after royal assent guidance must be in place for the regime to go live and the government will be work with the cma to ensure timely implementation the secretary of state will of course review all guidance for all future iteration the hon lady also talk about amendment and which seek to replace the countervail benefit exemption with power for the cma to consider benefit to user before find breach of conduct requirement the exemption will ensure that there be rigorous process to secure the good outcome for consumer and remove it would jeopardise clear regulatory expectation and predictable outcome in turn this would make it more likely that consumer lose out on the innovation develop by sms firm such as privacy or security benefit government amendment and clarify the exemption while crucially maintain the same high threshold and clear process the hon lady also mention amendment and and the government agree that it be important that the dmu regulatory decision be transparent and that the right information be available to the public we understand that these amendment would require the dmu to send decision notice to third party that it assess to be most affect by those decision however under the current drafting the dmu be already require to publish the summary of key decision require the dmu to identify appropriate third party and send they notice would introduce significant burden on the dmu to limited benefit and argue that it would undermine the flexibility and quick pace that we expect from the dmu we believe the current drafting strike the right balance provide transparency and public accountability on dmu decision the hon member for richmond park sarah olney table an amendment seek to implement procedure to set out an exhaustive list of benefit to which the countervail benefit exemption can apply digital market be fast move and we do not want to risk consumer miss out on benefit that be not yet foresee list of acceptable type of benefit could quickly become out of date even with the procedure that she propose to permit the amendment also seek to impose six month time limit however the bill already include provision for six month deadline for conduct investigation so that time limit be not necessary be particularly grateful to my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland and other member who recently meet my predecessor and the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who be responsible for enterprise and market to discuss the appeal standard for the digital market regime thank they for their positive engagement throughout the bill passage and especially over the past few day as get to grip with the bill have great respect for my right hon and learn friend and he bring up some very interesting point and challenge he be right to put forward those challenge so that we can address they acknowledge that my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright also want clarity on proportionality although regulatory decision will be make under judicial review principle we be introduce requirement for proportionality in the dmu core regulatory tool conduct requirement and pro competition intervention at the point at which they be impose let be unequivocal and clear that we be introduce proportionality at the point of intervention so that it can be ground for appeal via the legislation on top of the procedural and legality ground commonly associate with judicial review warmly welcome my hon friend to his place as this be my first chance to do so be we now to understand that with regard to the judicial review standard proportionality will in effect be build in and that we be go beyond the principle of plain vanilla jr into the more widely understand term be right suggest that write to my right hon and learn friend and to all right hon and hon member who have raise the important question of proportionality to clarify the position we want this legislation to have clarity for consumer and certainty for business because as my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg say this be an ever change market so it be essential that we have clarity and certainty the point about proportionality extend into clause where the government have now remove the indispensability test leave bare proportionality my amendment ask for necessity test what assessment have my hon friend make of the removal of indispensability do he still think that the threshold for countervail benefit will be sufficiently high to ensure that the cma do not disapply or discontinue investigation inappropriately that be an important point and appreciate my right hon and learn friend give the opportunity to clarify it want to be unequivocal that from my perspective the threshold be still high and we have provide clarify if he require even further clarity be happy to write to he to be completely clear be grateful for what my hon friend have say so far about the application of the proportionality test but if he be to follow up with member in write with some clarity can he set out what he believe the ground for challenge would be on the basis of proportionality the intervention that the cma may make and the ruling it may give be at the end of quite lengthy process of market analysis demonstration of abuse of market power and breach of conduct requirement if those be challenge routinely and at late stage on the basis that there be ground to say that it be disproportionate it could have the unintended consequence of delay system in way that they should not be delay if hear my hon friend correctly he want letter on that this legislation be design to make sure that it be not for big company to litigate heavily to stifle the small challenger from come out and become the big company and employer of tomorrow let write to he to clarify the point far my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon have speak about accountability in my numerous conversation with he over the past few day and again today take his point he will know that want independent versatile flexible and adaptable regulator that be only right for an ever change digital market that be always innovate and change the way it operate we do not know the unicorn of tomorrow or the benefit that we can get from consumer the competition and markets authority and the dmu have responsibility to be accountable to maintain that flexibility and to have adaptability to new technology and new entrant in the market as be sure he know and respect that be why independent regulator be central part of our internationally recognise business environment we should not forget that point take the point about overreach by regulator but they be core part of what international partner and investor look at when it come to the competition regime because they know that will be innovative and will encourage further innovation in technology the cma be operationally independent from government and government will not intervene in its regulatory decision the dmu will have discretion in how it design its intervention under the regime that discretion be match with robust accountability from initial decision making to appeal there be range of check and balance throughout the regime that provide assurance hope that reassure my right hon friend there be opportunity for government parliament and stakeholder to hold the cma to account but welcome his challenge and intervention on this point because it be important be sure that this will be look at again in the other place government should always be sensitive to those challenge the digital market regime will be oversee by cma board which be accountable to parliament for all key decision key decision will be take by committee of which at least half its member will offer an independent perspective be sure that he will welcome that because as new technology and innovation emerge in the market we will need new expertise my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland make the important point that the growth and expansion of regulation in digital market be necessary but substantial the ability of this place to keep track of how the regulator use their power be increasingly important that may be beyond the work of any departmental select committee but instead require something like the public accounts committee as he suggest separate committee whose job be to focus on and scrutinise such work that be recommend by the house of lords communications and digital committee and also by the joint committee on the online safety bill do not expect the minister to give we an answer right now but if he could reflect on that need and give some guidance to the house that would be welcome my hon friend make an important point that be matter for wide discussion on accountability be happy to have that discussion with he in future as thing currently stand there be sufficient balance and check in place but be always open to have further discussion with he could the minister give some clarification on my point about fair reimbursement to the journalist and publish house that produce original content as the new minister be he prepare to meet the national union of journalists to hear its concern directly if the hon member will be ever so patient will address that point because it be important my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon talk about the dmu ex ante power which want to address because it be an important measure we propose to give the dmu ex ante power to impose obligation on designate firm because of the characteristic of digital market which make they particularly fast move and likely to tip in favour of new powerful winner we do not think that approach be appropriate for firm in other market that do not exhibit the same quality even if firm meet the turnover condition and carry out digital activity the dmu will still need to find evidence that the firm have substantial and entrenched market power as well as position of strategic significance in the activity to designate the firm the dmu will prioritise the area where there will be great benefit for market and consumer and will reflect the cma strategic steer provide by the government which be design to reflect the policy as intend think that everyone wish to achieve the same objective so do not quite understand why his majesty government do not accept the amendment of my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland which will make that clear beyond doubt will safeguard it and will tidy up the legislation will address my right hon friend point we have listen to the concern and discuss they in great detail but believe the government amendment strike the right balance between prioritise the benefit to the consumer while help the digital market to remain flexible and innovative allow for the future tech of tomorrow to be big challenger one of the great strength of the bill lie in the speed and flexibility of the toolkit to well equip the regulator to tackle fast move and dynamic digital market the amendment will maintain an effective agile and robust process and will not undermine the digital markets unit ability to intervene in timely and impactful way they will ensure that the dmu approach be proportionate and beneficial to consumer hope that we have reach good position with the members have speak about but want to turn to the point raise by my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins who be ever so eloquent about the challenge that the legislation be look to overcome and the balance that it seek be greatly appreciative of his support and the challenge he have put down in respect of the hon member for easington grahame morris the final offer mechanism which strengthen the hand of small business when they challenge those big business be design with the challenge he have put forward in mind hope that he appreciate that we recognise the traditional business model of news medium particularly print medium which have be substantially disrupt by the growth of digital the regime be design to help rebalance the relationship between major platform and those who rely on they include news publisher that could include create an obligation to offer fair and reasonable payment term for the use or acquisition of digital include news content will absolutely take up the offer to meet the nuj and hear its concern hope that this measure go long way towards appease those concern by rebalance the market and ensure that firm that have strategic market significance know that they must present much fair deal for regional print medium have long be an admirer of the contribution of my right hon friend the member for north east somerset who be ever so thoughtful we agree on effective regulation and an effective regulator but be sad to say that today we have come to different conclusion in this ever change market we know that where there be monopolistic behaviour have regulator that be adaptable and flexible provide the opportunity to nurture further competition often talk and have talk today about the unicorn of tomorrow my right hon friend the member for north east somerset and my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon talk about tesco think that we have clarify that issue but to clarify it far for firm to be designate by the dmu it have to satisfy three fundamental point it have to have digital activity it have to have substantial and entrenched market power and it have to hold strategic position in the market do not want to pre empt what the cma or dmu may do in term of tesco designate status that be not my job today at the dispatch box however hope that the test that have set out reassure member that company such as tesco will not fall under this measure because they have highly competitive market include in the online world perhaps the minister will forgive for juxtapose his reluctance to make thing clear in primary legislation when discuss this clause and what the government seek to do in part on subscription it seem to very odd to conduct subscription regulation mechanism by use primary legislation there be conflict in the logic be apply here and be sorry that have to point that out to he be sure that the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake will appreciate the pass that be just about to give he be sure that he will address that issue in his speech reiterate my gratitude to the opposition for their co operative behaviour which have be inform about by my predecessor and to right hon and hon member across the house for the challenge that they have put forward today be grateful to member across the house for their contribution and hope that they continue to work with the government we will continue to work with member as the bill progress through parliament to ensure that it drive innovation grow the economy and deliver well outcome for consumer that be what the government care about we want highly competitive market that innovate and nurture the technology company of

its passage thank in particular the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones and for feltham and heston seema malhotra for their constructive engagement and commitment to see the bill deliver quickly so that its benefit can be realise also thank my hon friend the member for weston super mare john penrose for his excellent engagement over the weekend in particular and my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland for his many important and relevant amendment the reform to the competition and consumer regime contain in part to of the bill will grow the economy and deliver well outcome for consumer and bona fide business consumer will have more choice and protection and pay low price business will operate on fair and more level playing field the reform will do that by enhance the wide competition regime strengthen the enforcement of consumer protection law and put in place new consumer right and more transparency it be simple fact that the way in which we buy product and service today very often involve digital process the opportunity that follow be vast more accessibility flexibility and choice for consumer but there be also great risk of consumer harm include for example consumer be trap in subscription contract that they no long want or purchase good that may not be up to scratch because they unknowingly rely on fake review we must ensure that consumer and their cash be protect swifter intervention to tackle bad business practice against consumer be expect to deliver consumer benefit of billion over year as uk consumer benefit from new right strong law enforcement and more competition through merger control importantly the reform will also grow the economy by boost competition well place the uk to succeed in export market it will allow the competition and markets authority to more effectively deter prevent and where necessary enforce against monopolistic behaviour that will ensure that the free market can operate effectively the government amendment to part to of the bill will provide great clarity ensure coherence with related legislation and make sure the bill measure meet their intend aim almost all the amendment be technical in nature will address they across four category competition consumer enforcement consumer right and cross cut provision first the competition measure in the bill will give the cma new power to enable it to tackle anti competitive activity swiftly and effectively mean that it can focus its work on the area of great potential harm the competition environment be complex and ever evolve we must respond carefully but decisively to change in the judicial and legislative landscape to provide certainty and to avoid any unintended detrimental consequence of wide development new clause amend the competition act so that the absolute bar on damage base agreement be rely on in opt out collective action will not apply to third party litigation funding agreement which be the main source of funding for that type of action that respond to recent supreme court judgment and effectively restore the previously hold understanding of the status of litigation fund agreement under the act accordingly it will have retrospective effect in response to recent competition appeal tribunal judgment we be specify the circumstance in which market investigation reference may be make in relation to an area that have already be the subject of market study but be not refer for further investigation at that time we be also bring forward series of amendment to ensure alignment between this bill and the energy act which introduce the energy network merger regime and to make minor correction to provision relate to that regime separately we be repeal paragraph of schedule to the act to remove redundant reference to the treaty establish the european coal and steel community to ensure that the implementation trial for market remedy introduce by the bill be as effective as possible we be introduce new power for the secretary of state to extend the scope of implementation trial in the market regime to include regulatory condition will now address the new direct consumer enforcement model that model will enable the cma to act fast and take on more consumer case on behalf of the public result in far estimate direct benefit to consumer of ten or potentially hundred of million of pound the government have table series of technical amendment to increase certainty in respect of the cma operational duty they include align the definition of business in part of the bill with that in part of chapter to ensure that any breach of unfair trading prohibition can be enforce through the regime and make provision about information sharing between public authority so that enforcer can obtain the information that they need to take enforcement action under part of the bill on appeal we be add requirement for the cma to include information about applicable appeal right in final breach of direction enforcement notice as well as empower the appeal court to send issue back to the cma for decision on certain notice we be also empower the secretary of state to update through regulation the specify maximum amount for fixed and daily penalty imposable by court or the cma when business breach formal information request move on to consumer right be sure this will interest many member across the house the purpose of the bill be simple to empower consumer to get the deal that be right for they and to increase their confidence in the product they buy and the service they use the new right on subscription trap will give consumer more control over their spending such trap have be the subject of some debate during the passage of the bill and the government be introduce amendment to remove unintended consequence welcome the introduction of consumer right on subscription which have become real minefield for many people of all age why do the government feel it necessary to have this provision in the bill and in primary legislation when if it be in secondary legislation it could have more flexibility with change circumstance we think it be sufficiently important issue and something we consult on previously we have good idea of the kind of measure we would like to put in place and we be add more flexibility my hon friend will have see some of the government amendment that have be table in response to concern raise by member of the house include my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon we want that flexibility yet we want to move on quickly with this important reform there be about billion of potential benefit to consumer through this bill commend the minister who be put forward idea that and perhaps my party feel we can subscribe to and support always ask this question because think it be important that the general public have an access point if they have question on something to do with consumer right do the government intend to ensure that there be some methodology phone call an email address or contact person who the public can contact if they have question our position be that we do not intervene in the practice of business unless there be necessity to do so we leave those channel open for decision by business in the service that they offer to consumer rather than dictate to they how they should communicate with their consumer it be absolutely right that those channel be open and freely available one important thing we be do in the bill be make it much easy to terminate contract person should be able to end contract as easily as they enter into it and that be an important part of the bill the government be bring forward series of amendment that remove the requirement for business that offer subscription contract to send reminder notice ahead of the first renewal notice in instance where there be no free trial for business that offer those contract type the amendment will see their regulatory burden decrease as they will be require to send only two reminder notice per year instead of three that also ensure that consumer do not receive too many notice at the start of their contract the requirement to send reminder notice before free or low cost trial roll over to full contract will remain in place in addition we be create new power for the secretary of state to disapply or modify reminder notice requirement in respect of particular entity or contract and amend the timeframe in which business must send reminder notice to consumer the amendment provide great flexibility and clarity on when reminder notice should be send allow for adaptability post implementation further amendment clarifie that in the event of dispute about the cancellation of contract the onus be on the consumer to prove that the method in which they send notification to cancel their subscription contract be sufficiently clear that intend to rectify the concern that business will be subject to enforcement action if consumer attempt to cancel their subscription contract through unconventional mean for example through tweet thank my right hon friend the member for calder valley craig whittaker and the hon member for gordon richard thomson for their continued engagement on second reading and in committee on the issue of whether society lottery be capture under the subscription measure as say in committee it be certainly not our intention to capture those contract we be therefore introduce an amendment to clarify that gambling contract which be already regulate under gambling law be exclude from the scope of the subscription contract measure trust that that amendment will offer they and those in the industry clarity on the matter let turn to series of technical government amendment in relation to protection for consumer saving scheme such scheme involve make deposit to save towards specified event such as christmas or back to school shopping and they be vital mean for british family to budget for those big occasion the bill be not design to capture routine advance payment for service in order to avoid possible uncertainty we be introduce amendment that will exclude contract regulate by ofcom such as prepaid pay as you go mobile phone contract as well as contract for prepaid passenger transport service such as prepay transport for london oyster card from the list of what constitute consumer saving scheme finally we be introduce two amendment to maintain the effect of the consumer protection unfair trading regulations which the bill repeal and largely restate the first relate to the application of disclosure of information provision in part of the enterprise act and the second relate to the information requirement place on trader in certain circumstance two technical amendment be also be introduce new clause to make series of recommendation relate to the recommendation make by the cma in its market study report on road fuel competitive market drive down price and offer significant mean of tackle cost of living pressure that be why we commission the cma road fuel study which lead to market study in which the cma find that competition between fuel retailer have weaken in recent year accept the recommendation of that study we be take swift action to introduce an ongoing road fuel price monitoring function within the cma to monitor development in the road fuel market the amendment provide the cma with information gather power that will allow it to operate that function effectively the power be similar to those that the cma can use during market study or investigation but specific to the road fuel sector the amendment will allow the cma to ask business involve in the distribution supply or retail of petrol and diesel for information in order to assess competition in the market and the impact on consumer the new power be support by enforcement provision include for the cma to impose civil penalty for non compliance the power will be time limited and will require review by the secretary of state after five year to consider whether the power should be extend by regulation will finish on cross cut provision that affect the digital market competition and consumer regime we be remove the eight year tenure limit for competition appeal tribunal chair enable the cat to retain experienced and skilled judge further set of amendment relate to the provision of investigative assistance to overseas authority in connection with overseas criminal competition and consumer enforcement investigation the investigative provision apply across the digital market competition and consumer regime finally some technical amendment to the general provision apply across the bill deal with matter such as commencement want to ensure that there be plenty of time for member to debate the bill at this important stage and appreciate the constructive and collaborative approach that colleague have so far take during the passage of the bill first let say how pleased be to see the minister remain in post and thank he for his collaboration during the passage of the bill it have be appreciate by those on the labour front bench be keen to highlight number of amendment table in my name that sadly have be significant government omission new clause and relate to subscription trap which frustratingly still remain in the bill have hear from the minister and be grateful for his approach but labour have pledge to end subscription trap which see consumer get stick in auto renew contract that they do not explicitly ask for follow free trial by make company end automatic renewal as default option the plan would change the current system of opt out to ensure that customer actively opt in save people money during this tory government cost of living crisis in the last year alone people in the uk spend half billion pound on subscription that auto renew without they realise and unused subscription be cost people more than million per year that be impact marginalised group and those on low income considerably more than other it could mean that those least able to absorb the cost of be in subscription trap be more likely to be in one and the impact on those people will be more acute although the government have recently make change so that company will be mandate to provide reminder to consumer before renew their subscription sadly that change do not go far enough urge colleague to support these new clause because this issue be impact people in each of our constituency the length and breadth of our island in addition amendment would address the common issue of drip pricing which impact people across the uk as colleague will be aware drip pricing be the practice of business advertise only part of the product price and then later reveal other obligatory charge as the customer go through the buying process the government promise to tackle that issue in the king speech but they have not table their own amendment on it indeed the king speech be the fourth time that this government have promise to act since and enough be enough can the minister clarify exactly why the government have choose to ignore the opportunity to right this wrong in the legislation broadly the bill be welcome by the opposition but it be well overdue it be positive step forward in create new competition in digital market that will enable the competition authority to work closely and fairly with business to ensure fair competition and to promote growth and innovation labour in particular welcome competition and consumer choice and protection as sign of healthy function market economy it be vital if we be to make the uk the good place in the world to start and grow business that digital opportunity be open for all we be committed to ensure that pro business pro worker pro society agenda be build for britain and we see consumer protection and competition law as play an integral part in that look forward to the minister response and look forward to see this bill finally progress to become an act may start where leave off when the bill hit second reading by say that it be extremely welcome and create an enormous amount of important and much need change continue to support it in principle my purpose in rise today be to speak to new clause which have table and parliamentary colleague have support those who be familiar with the kremlinology of the conservative parliamentary party will understand that the new clause do something wondrous to behold which be that it unite the breadth and every single part of the party behind one central idea well regulation should pause briefly just to say that well regulation be distinct from deregulation well regulation be not say that we want to trash standard it be say that standard of everything from environmental standard to worker right all matter but it do also matter that government of any type and stripe make sure they try to deliver those standard in the cheap and most efficient and economically logical way possible that be the difference between deregulation and well regulation it be about deliver high standard but in the most economically sensible way that be what new clause attempt to do it be worth point out that we have regime that work pretty well for about five or six year between and and it do something along those line it be call one in one out and then it be upgrade to one in two out it basically say that any new piece of legislation or regulation have to be cost for the extra cost it be add on to the british economy and before it could be introduce the minister concerned have to find an equally large amount of cost to remove from other regulation elsewhere to begin with later it be twice as much cost to remove from other regulation elsewhere that work reasonably well except that it have some loophole deliberately leave partly because it could not affect anything create in brussels when we be member of the eu and also because it do not cover thing such as the economic regulator ofgem and ofwat and so on that system change to what everyone hop would be well one in but it turn out to be an absolute disaster instead of gently but steadily bear down on the cost of regulation we see huge ballooning in cost in the first year of the new system and there be target of reduce the cost of regulation across the economy by billion or billion instead of that they increase by that amount one would have think that would have mean that the sky fall in everyone would have be horrify by that notion and this place would have be up in arm but not bit of it there be zero reaction from any party across the house because the system be lack some crucial point the crucial thing it be miss be proper accountability mechanism for when government of any kind fail to deliver on well regulation principle and on reduce the cost to wealth creation in this country and inherently therefore reduce the rate of growth in the country and the improvement in productivity that we all want to see it mean nothing happen within parliament clearly we can not leave thing as they stand and new clause be an attempt to try to put that right it would do something very simple and it come back to what have call net zero red tape which be effectively one in one out with the cost of any new piece of legislation or regulation need to be match by find countervail saving elsewhere but it would also do something else the new clause say we need to make sure that there be not just commitment from ministers but legal duty on government not just this government but all future government to make sure that everyone who be minister when they get out of bed on monday morning know they have legal duty to deliver on this that would mean that if ministers do not deliver on it they will have break the law break the law mean they be in breach of the ministerial code which this parliament and all parliaments take seriously it would be far more effective trigger mechanism for ensure proper accountability and that this measure be deliver would be the first to admit that this new clause be not perfect that be because the parliamentary clerks have rightly say hang on second this bill have scope and you can not exceed it therefore the new clause can not even though devoutly wish that it could apply the basic principle that have just be explain to the house across the entire economy would that it could as it be it can only apply those principle to the economic regulator and anything to do with competition and consumer law that be huge step forward because as mention the previous regime all exclude the activity of economic regulator and we will now enfranchise they if we agree this new clause that be worth do but the new clause be far from perfect because it can not cover the rest of the economy incidentally the relevant bit of accountancy the reporting on whether cost have be add or subtract have to devolve to the competition and markets authority under the scope of the bill when in fact perfectly respectable initial grouping the regulatory policy committee already do it it be full of clever and well intentione people and think the cma would rather it do not have to do this work if it could avoid it it would rather that other do it it be not perfect amendment but it none the less would take we big step in much need direction and establish an important principle be grateful to the minister my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who mention that we have be have extensive discussion over the weekend in an attempt to lock in these fundamental underlying principle and to find way to perhaps broaden they beyond just the scope of this bill hope that in his closing remark he will be able to come up with some comment that may allow not to press this amendment to vote fundamentally the crucial thing we have to ensure be proper independent measurement reporting and accountability on the cost of new regulation rather than anything that can be lend on by government proper consequence for ministers in any government who fail to deliver on try to reduce those cost and that no government feel like they have blank cheque on spend other people money it be stark to examine the difference in how we approach taxpayer fund spending versus regulation cost fund spending at the moment minister or official who want to spend taxpayer money have squillion different hoop that they have to jump through and rightly so there be lot of control on that spending undertake by the treasury and follow up by the public accounts committee and can see one of the senior member of that committee here today my hon friend the member for the cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown it be highly regulated and control and great attention be pay to it in this chamber however if one want to spend five or time that amount of money by increase the cost to business through regulation there be not peep much less attention be pay to those way of spend cash and that can not be right as everybody here will understand pound take in tax have the same underlying economic impact on the country rate of growth as pound take in extra cost to business we should treat both thing with equal seriousness rather than pay huge attention to one and largely blithely ignore the other while write blank cheque any regime have to fix that problem as well my hon friend engage in some self deprecation at the beginning of his speech about the scope of the new clause which co sign but think he be undersell it the consumer protection and economic regulation in the new clause go long way towards reduce the burden of red tape the second thing that be really important be that this be not about the number of regulation but their economic value that be what really place burden on business in this country will he explain how he be go to establish baseline through the new clause if this thing be to be measure properly we have to have proper baseline my hon friend be right may have be guilty of be too glass half empty rather than glass half full the new clause go very long way and enfranchise large chunk of the economy that perhaps have not be deal with properly up until now just want to go even far and cover the entire economy he be right to point out that the new clause do quite lot but it be half loaf rather than the whole loaf if can put it that way my hon friend be also right to say that the accountancy the measurement of the cost be crucial if we be try to do one in one out we have to know the cost of the thing come in so that we can know what saving we have to find elsewhere as mention the crucial thing be that we need to have an independent accounting body an independent measurement body that will require the regulatory policy committee to be make little more independent and to be give more arm length ability to set those accounting and measurement standard in way that can not be leant on by senior ministers senior mandarin or senior regulator the committee need to be able to look those people in the eye and say no this be the way it get to be like any good external auditor it need to be sufficiently at arm length to deal with that if it do so properly it will mean that any set of measurement can be rely on both by my hon friend committee and the rest of this chamber that be essential to bring my remark to close if we do not adopt the system propose in the new clause we need system that provide proper accountability for anybody who fail to hit these target proper measurement and independent accounting standard to make sure that government and regulator can not mark their own homework and proper target of some kind to make sure there be standard to which ministers must be hold hope that my hon friend the minister will be able to reassure and look forward to his remark it be pleasure to follow the hon member for weston super mare john penrose who make some very interesting argument in some of they hear echo of the argument that have be make by the opposition during my few year in this place about try to measure the effect that legislation have when it be pass amendment that seek to measure that effect routinely get knock down but there be fundamentally useful point in what he say about the need to make sure that we be not suffer from unintended consequence and that the goal we be seek be the one that result so that corrective measure can be take if they be not hansard record that on second reading be wish good luck by the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones when perhaps intoxicate by an overly friendly and useful exchange across the floor about the scourge of fake review think we might get to consensus that would allow something to appear in the bill sadly the hon member cynicism appear to have be well found there be certainly nothing about fake review in the bill that can see accept that the government might amend that in future through secondary legislation they be certainly able to do so but as say early this afternoon that inevitably restrict the scope of the sanction that can be levy for that behaviour appear to have have little more success in another area in his opening remark the minister say that when it come to additional gold plating of the rule and regulation affect charity lottery and gambling for that purpose there be risk of charitable organisation be catch up as an unintended consequence of the legislation be absolutely delighted that the government appear to have listen and have table government amendment which exclude contract for gambling that be regulate by other legislation from the new regime for subscription contract very much welcome that amendment on that basis will not seek to move amendment which stand in my name and which press to division in committee rather gruesome spectre be raise in the debate early phantasm and fear that will not arise apparently that bring neatly to new clause and which be table by the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg series of amendment that appear to be aim squarely at somewhat contest narrative surround the personal financial arrangement of somebody currently reside in very small part of jungle somewhere in australia their appearance there be set to land they fee that if the scale of that bounty be as report would surely have every private banking manager the length and breadth of london fight for their custom when most of we speak in this chamber about financial exclusion usually we be talk about lack of access to cash or about the ability to access one cash without service charge at an atm we be talk about lack of access to credit or to any kind of bank account and very much not about those suffer the privation and indignity of have to deal with bog standard current account rather than be court by coutts the hon gentleman be absolutely right that this issue have come to people attention because of nigel farage will talk about that case in moment but what have emerge be that actually quite lot of people and sometimes charity who have view that bank do not like find that they be not able to get access to bank account which nowadays be fundamentally important thing for people carry on an ordinary daily life thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention there be already multiplicity of legislation and entitlement indeed he appear to reference they in new clause that can be use to tackle such circumstance when they arise if indeed they do find it very encouraging that in draft new clause the right hon gentleman have alight on the relevant provision of the european convention on human right which provide very useful earthing point for many of the fundamental right that we hold dear and indeed be bulwark of civilised society perhaps we will see similarly stout defence of they in future debate in this chamber very much welcome new clause which will require company to comply with request for information from the competition and markets authority when it come to the pricing of motor fuel on november the cma publish its first monitoring report on the road fuel market and while of the large retailer respond to that request be give to understand that two do not from my perspective and be sure the perspective of many other wherever in this chamber they sit that be simply not acceptable be sure we can all point to large variation in the cost of petrol diesel and other form of motor fuel across our constituency sometimes in fill station that be only few mile apart or even within relatively close proximity that be certainly great source of contention for people right across my constituency so the government require retailer to provide the cma with that information be an important strengthening of its power and one that we welcome new clause and which stand in the name of the hon member for pontypridd seek to tackle subscription trap appreciate that the government have table amendment which seek to tackle these trap by issue reminder and that be welcome step forward nevertheless be bind to observe that snp members at least believe that well balance could be strike by ask consumer whether they wish to opt in to automatic renewal or to variable rate contract rather than simply get reminder about they which will inevitably end up in the recycling bin or junk mail folder even for the most attentive of consumer have to opt in would be far well and it would protect the consumer interest to far great extent than simply have the opt out option email or mail or convey in some other way in due course if those new clause be put to vote the snp will support they in the lobby hope to speak briefly as the hor for the pièce de résistance which will be the speech by my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg who have table excellent amendment although do not sign they for which apologise very much endorse and support his effort in these area these be important matter that need to be deal with and this be the right forum in which to do so wish to speak briefly in summary about provision that speak to in the first group and simply reiterate that the thrust of the new clause have table and be support in by number of right hon and hon member be all about accountability new clause seek review of the work of the competition appeal tribunal and be all about make sure that that body be function as effectively and expeditiously as possible to deal with these important matter the work of the tribunal have become progressively more scrutinised do not wish to cast aspersion on its chair or member who work extremely hard it be an impressive body which be look upon internationally for its work however there be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of many other that there be more work to be do to streamline and improve the cat process if it be increasingly to be look upon and rely upon as an important arbiter of issue relate to digital market among other thing the consumer interest duty set out in new clause be at the heart of what we be try to do here couple with that new clause seek to allow claim for damage under part of the bill and be an attempt to reframe the way in which the government be approach the provision on subscription to which have table number of amendment be grateful to my hon friend the minister and the government for have listen and move on that issue however it seem to put the cart before the horse little to not allow claim for damage but to put through exemption that would mean that if be to seek to terminate my subscription via twitter the company concern would not be liable it would be far well to have general liability in damage and not to have such prescriptive clause in the first place that would be liable to misinterpretation be offer the minister another way of look at it that would be less prescriptive have to come back to the minister on the point that make to the under secretary of state for science innovation and technology my hon friend the member for meriden saqib bhatti there be an odd juxtaposition between different part of the bill where we be tell in one breath that primary legislation be not the appropriate vehicle for prescribing procedure yet here we be prescribe in minute detail procedure relate to subscription in the bill my hon and learn friend the member for eddisbury edward timpson have make the point for and it be one we well know secondary legislation allow for great flexibility so that if new potential problem or abuse be identify in this fast grow market the government would be able to plug the hole and deal with the subscription issue my amendment seek to change the requirement on reminder so that they be issue not every six month but every month it accept that whereas have subscription but be sadly unable to watch that much tv many other enjoy subscription to various provider be on top of their subscription and know exactly what they be do we must not make an assumption that the consumer be utterly uninterested in how they spend their money these subscription will amount to lot for many family and be significant outlay for they accept that we do not want people to be trap inadvertently or market abuse but we sometimes need to reflect the reality of the situation more appropriately the amendment month requirement align the provision with what we see in other regulated sector there be nothing particularly novel about the way in which want that amendment to work absolutely support the government intent on termination right want it to be easy for consumer to leave contract the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake know the point about any mean and have seek to deal with it suggest well way as for cool off period which be deal with in my amendment to do not know whether they actually deal with the subscription trap issue clearly free or discount subscription period be legitimate and well recognise strategy that allow customer to exit we have to be careful when we place constraint on the ability to offer those period in order to attract new customer and there could be unintended consequence here the cool off period could perversely allow consumer to sign up binge watch series one of the crown and come off the subscription but then sign up and binge watch again when series two come out without have pay penny piece that be not right and it do not strike the right balance give the historical problem that provider have with people piggy backing on other subscription and enjoy service that one should reasonably be expect to pay for look at the lack of prescription on the number of time people can enter and exit cool off period we see that perverse incentive may well be create as result of the change in the bill let we not forget that we have provision on cool off period that will continue to apply ask the government to tread carefully and to focus on the great harm cause by subscription trap rather than seek to complicate the position far on implementation the government have the choice of allow commencement two month after royal assent which would be normal or lay commencement order strongly urge they to be clear about commencement order and timing because implementation be everything and this legislation potentially bring significant regulatory burden for business in the sector suggest that we not only provide for sufficient time but have sense of choreography and bring regulatory change in on common date at the beginning of october or april of any give year be absolutely with the minister in seek to get this right and to get regulation in the right place but ask he to make his imprint on the legislative calendar little less heavily and to use more flexible mechanism than primary legislation would be the first to criticise the government for excessive use of delegate legislation the principle should be that we place matter in the bill where appropriate but in world where so much be delegate and so much be not in primary legislation it seem incongruous to say the least that we be prescribe this regime in this particular way look forward my hon friend the minister response to my argument and thank he for his engagement on this issue rise to speak to amendment and in my name which would introduce take down power to ensure that unsafe or counterfeit good be remove from sale online we cover this issue in some detail in the bill committee where the problem of dangerous online sale be liken to the wild west due to the risk to individual consumer and the lack of governance be disappointed that we still do not have clarity on how the government want to tackle this grow concern because this be fundamentally about safety and the government fail in their core duty to keep people safe the minister know that unsafe product buy online have cause death in the uk we have see fire and other catastrophic damage cause by dodgy good buy online and since the committee complete its consideration coroner have specifically cite faulty bike charger in report on death the coroner report in september suggest that at least people have die and further have be injure in faulty bike and scooter blaze in the uk since alone and that be only one area of problematic online sale the coroner report go on to call for great action and say it be clear that there be an exist ongoing and future risk of further death whilst it continue to be the case that there be no control or standard govern the sale in the uk of lithium ion battery and charger and conversion kit for electric power personal vehicle there be call for the government to act in the face of further problematic item and dangerous good be sell online my amendment help to address the situation where such item be identify not everything we discuss in this place be life and death issue but this can be the minister have have many representation from organisation about the growth of unsafe and dodgy good sell online as legit the british toy hobby association and electrical safety first issue briefing that support my amendment in committee trading standard also support great mean of take action and brief in support of the amendment in committee at this time of year it be even more important to act and raise awareness because many people be buy their christmas gift online be super organised have my seven year old christmas present all safely stash away at home be pretty confident she be not watch tonight and will not be look for they although who know genuinely would not buy her gift online because be fearful about what happen to those who do trust some online site research by the british toy hobby association in show that some of child toy buy online be unsafe for child to play with and be illegal to sell in the uk that be very disturbing some of the problem it discover be counterfeit good fire safety and chemical restriction failure and packaging or part that present choke hazard they be all product that online marketplace have be tell about but have not remove from sale in committee we have more time for detailed example we have less time here so will give just one the toy crocodile story and will make it snappy in july amazon be tell about dangerous crocodile toy that be put child life at risk and be be sell widely online trading standard intervene several time and in january the office for product safety and standards also intervene but that toy range be still on sale online today five year later that be unacceptable and sadly it be not one off the opss have issue recall notice due to what it call serious risk of fire and electric shock for product that be still on sale on amazon and that be still on sale on ebay there be fundamental problem with the current regime and system my amendment seek to restore confidence the consumer organisation which have also alert mp to among other issue that it have discover the problem of energy save device that do not save energy but do present significant risk include plug with no fuse there be unity in the call for great action the chief executive of the government own office for product safety and standards say last november that there be too much evidence of non compliant product be sell by third party seller online the national audit office and the public accounts committee have also call for action my amendment be not about new regulation or new pressure on business which the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg talk about they be about enforce standard and rule for all both online and on our high street the minister when he open this section of the debate say that he want fairness and level playing field for all want that for british consumer and business as well people have misplace faith that there be level playing field and that what they see in argos and what they can buy on amazon be regulate in the same way but sadly they be not and without my amendment they will not be since committee have tidy up the amendment slightly to ensure that they include power to require the removal of item that be unsafe or counterfeit that power link to the government list of organisation in clause to ensure that the same body as be list in the bill be involve be try to help the government and try to help more generally because there be wide benefit to get this right uk high street be struggle remove unsafe good from online sale will mean that british high street shop that meet regulation will get boost as will british manufacturer who play by the rule but be undercut by import from other country that do not meet our safety and other standard my amendment be design to address all those issue and help to ensure that our standard be meet there be unity in the call for great regulation and for new sheriff or new marshal for the wild west not rhinestone cowboy sing the same old song and try to stick up for system that be fail british customer will end on consumer right do not believe in the enfeeble state which seem to be accept by some ministers we be tell that the whole take back control narrative be suppose to lead to well right for brits but we already lack right that our european cousin have french dutch irish and polish customer now all have well protection through the digital services act which have be pass by the eu since we leave it crucially with the support of amazon it be beyond shock that amazon seem to understand and support the need for change before most of the uk government do however there be glimmer of hope there be one minister who have call for action and have say that we should make the uk the safe place in the world to shop and do business online that same minister tell this house that we should go far than that and require marketplace to ensure that such product be not on their site at all report january vol agree with that minister these amendment help to deliver his aim and we be lucky that that minister be before we in this debate hope that when he get back to his foot he will reward my optimism and say that the government will act now will not push the two amendment to vote today in the hope that my take down power will be take up by the government before or during lords consideration look forward to the minister response it be pleasure to follow the hon member for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle be also grateful to the minister for his thorough engagement on these matter he have be extremely diligent helpful and as always courteous let begin by declare sort of semi interest do not think it be technically one that the standards commissioner would worry about but mr farage and both appear on television programme under the auspex of gb news at about the same time of day follow he have no financial relationship with mr farage we merely appear on gb news at similar time of day it be mr farage who bring to the attention of the public the issue of de banking it be great problem if someone bank suddenly say to they we be not provide you with any facility where do they go it be very hard to go to new bank new bank do not want people who have be de banked nigel farage become in way the poster boy for this issue highlight something that be affect people up and down the country affect charity and affect business that have be to see as constituency mp in the past people run certain type of business who find that their banking facility be withdraw without any proper answer or explanation pawnbroker who come to see have have his banking facility take away his be perfectly honest and reputable business but inevitably it deal with lot of cash which make bank nervous and when they be nervous they need to give that customer proper explanation as to why they be no long get that service the hon member for gordon richard thomson in an elegant speech tease for stand up for nigel farage as if debanking be not common problem he mention that mr farage be off in the jungle eat offal and all sort of other tasty morsel yes that have have the benefit of bring people attention to something that be affect our constituent across the country therefore do indeed draw on definition but only definition from the european convention on human right this be not sudden damascene conversion to such document it be simply that those definition be in our law and it be useful to base any amendment to bill before the house on exist law that lead as always to thank the clerks for their mastery of ensure that amendment be within scope because get the new clause into scope as my hon friend the member for weston super mare john penrose find with his excellent new clause which will come to be not particularly easy that be why in affect consumer but not business it do not go as far as would have like this matter be of such fundamental importance you may think mr deputy speaker that be not all that much in favour of the modern world and that think it would be nice if we could go round with the odd groat or perhaps sovereign to pay our way but sadly that age of specie have go you might even say that the age of specie have become specious but it be in the past everybody now need modern banking facility cash be not use anything like as much as it be and every transaction that people carry out need piece of plastic bank that it come from and telephone or some type of technology when somebody be debanke it be like the outlawries bill on which we only ever have first reading they be effectively make an outlaw in their own land they be without the normal law of the land and the ability to do ordinary thing that be why new clause to be really important and protection for people to return again to nigel farage the idea that someone should be debanke because of legal political opinion be outrageous the hon member for gordon tease for mention nigel farage but actually separatist who want to break up the nation have political opinion that in other country would be consider treason those in china who say free tibet have an independent tibet do not get lot of quarter so once we start say that someone can be debanke for hold nigel farage view what about be in favour of scottish independence would that be view that one bank might not like and might say that member of the snp perfectly legal party should not be bank with it it affect every political opinion and political opinion may be fashionable today but tomorrow it may not be we always have to consider in legislation the protection of free speech against the interest of pass fashion because we and opposition members may be affect by it in slightly different or changed environment be we not talk about slightly different thing there be highly contest narrative around the circumstance the right hon gentleman describe but my understanding be that the gentleman in question be not so much debanke as offer less account and have subsequently find somewhere he can bank satisfactorily the hon gentleman be misinformed mr farage be only offer any new bank account with natwest rather than coutts when the story become public prior to that he have not be offer any banking facility nor have he be able to find another bank that would take he on so the fact of the matter be that coutts natwest debanke he because of the extraordinary internal set of communication which have become public and lead to the resignation effectively the firing of the chief executive of natwest partly for gossip about his banking circumstance but also for the behaviour that have lead to his banking facility be take away for his political opinion that be quite clear from the information that have emerge my right hon friend new clause relate to debanking prompt by particular incident would he not accept that there be the broad issue that the pursuit of environmental social and governance goal by corporation and the pursuit of value in association with diversity equity and inclusion objective raise the same issue on much broad front than banking facility what would he recommend the government should do on that agree with my hon friend that it do go much far some time ago the bank of england issue document suggest that loan should not be give to company invest in oil and gas when we need oil and gas for the foreseeable future think that this politicisation of banking be quite wrong and esg be not fulfil the fiduciary duty of investor to provide the good return to their client we should look at that can clarify that when the right hon member talk about bank outlaw and dodgy cash he talk about high street bank and not arron banks be talk about the banking system generally and be say that it be important that people should have banking facility regardless of their political view it be important that russian oligarch may be sanction that be legitimate thing for government to do but that require the rule of law want to touch briefly on some of the other amendment to which have attach my name once again agree with my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland on new clause and put the consumer first must be the essence of what we be try to do to my absolute horror have discover that agree with he on turn some of these measure into secondary legislation skeleton bills be dreadful thing we get awful legislation come into the house on which there be no detail at all because it will all be decide by ministers later such bills should be deprecate the house of lords be good at push back on they this house less so skeleton bills be bad idea except there be place for secondary legislation and that be it for some utterly random reason government who have bring forward extraordinary skeleton bills some of which could mention and have mention in the chamber on occasion have bring forward every last detail on something that in its essence will need revision and update and to meet different standard as time go by it be modest eccentricity to have put that in the bill suggest that in the other place the government look at whether that detail could be easily turn into secondary instrument with such instrument ready to come into force at the same time as the bill so there would be no delay that structurally would make for well bill be embarrassed to be speak in favour of secondary legislation because normally want to see thing in the bill if we could have promise of few skeleton bills in future would be delighted against that could not disagree more with new clause and those make real mistake dare say it they be typical socialist amendment because they do not trust people it seem to that people be sensible they know what they be do they volunteer to do it and they be free to undo it yes of course it be important that they should be free to undo it but there be cost to over regulation if we make company write all the time to say be you sure you want to do this that put up the price the profit margin for the business will not change but the price that they charge consumer will if they be constantly say do you want to leave we that will put the price up because there will be an administrative and bureaucratic cost to that and loss of business that will put up the overall cost for everybody it be legislate for inefficiency base on the idea that consumer be stupid well in north east somerset consumer be very clever highly intelligent and know what they have agree to and what they have not agree to congratulate my hon friend the member for weston super mare his new clause be genius because it get to the heart of an incredibly complicated and difficult matter that no other piece of legislation that we have try have really work with even the one in one out that we have from to do not really work seem to remember read that the crown ownership of sturgeon be cancel during this period because it count as one out allow some regulation to come in no doubt cost million as we get rid of something trivial one in one out be not really there but this new clause do it on proper cost audit and look ultimately to cover everything that be absolutely the right way to go my hon friend make the superb point that whenever any type of government expenditure be involve it be look at review and refer to committee yet when regulation worth billion be involve they pass through without so much as by your leave this be really important new clause and encourage the government to do whatever they can to implement it final thought before conclude be on petrol station this be very good news why be it that the tesco in paulton be more expensive than the local service station in ubley use the local service station in ubley because it be well value for money but tesco in paulton be more expensive than the tesco on the outskirt of bristol that be very unfair on my constituent and want it to bring its price down every little help thank you mr deputy speaker we all have that image in our head now of which particular supermarket you be talk about as other hon member have say this bill be much need and will help in so many way hon member have seek to address number of vex issue in this legislation this include an attempt through our opposition amendment to address drip pricing which know as chair of the all party parliamentary group on ticket abuse be especially prevalent in the primary and secondary ticketing market in these market customer often have to wait until the payment screen to see complete price breakdown in the secondary market customer be often draw in by google pay ad to professional look site such as viagogo which be sell ticket for many time their face value and engage in illicit business practice initial price while eye watering be present but there be no breakdown of the exact amount for service charge or vat the consumer be leave in the dark about what they be actually pay for until it be time to pay usually after have navigate many more time waste page on the website and almost lose the will to live and the power of rational thought even then the price be often still estimate when the customer eventually hit buy now after feel that they will lose the ticket if they do not make the decision quickly lot of customer still get nasty surprise when the payment confirmation email come in and they see the actual amount that have be take from their bank account or credit card move on more broadly to the competition and markets authority be aware that the cma make its recommendation on tackle abuse in the ticketing market to the government in august which the department for culture media and sport then sit on for over month before make an outright rejection of they principally these recommendation call for strong law to tackle illegal ticket resale and this bill could and should have be and could still be the perfect place to introduce those power be therefore very disappointed that the government be still resist these modest call from the body set up to regulate our market support effort in the bill to ensure healthy competition online but why not extend it to tackle online ticket tout site such as viagogo have be allow to grow and gain monopoly over ticket resale while be accuse of benefit from the illegal bulk buying of ticket and the wholesale speculative selling of ticket that they simply do not have this include viagogo seller attempt to sell thousand of festival ticket that they have not purchase and do not have the title to as well as something know as the golden circle an online rent bot group illegally buy mass of ticket for the upcoming tour of beyoncé and taylor swift even when artist such as swift actively speak out against tout and take measure to protect their ticket from end up in the hand of tout instead of fan body such as the cma need to be empower to address this abuse however some tory back benchers be today seek to tie the hand of the cma by force through new clause which would require the cma to spend more time on compile economic impact report than on protect business and consumer new clause would reduce the cma from be our strong statutory enforcement agency to toothless information collation and report write quango surely these report should be compile by body such as the regulatory policy committee not by the statutory enforcement agency do not know whether the hon lady hear my early remark but let reassure she that new clause would not reduce the cma just to that it would still have all its other power in fact the total number of staff employ by the rpc to do this at the moment be relatively small also mention that if the minister be able to come up with alternative way of deliver fully independent and therefore much more objective way of do the rpc job perhaps by strengthen the rpc would be delighted to accept that instead agree be sure that would be much well way definitely do not think that the cma should have to do what the new clause be seek to do have it on good authority that professional tout now number anywhere from and in all the time have be campaign and speak on this issue which be get on for year those number be in the ten the fifty and the hundred it shock to know that we be now try to deal with this level of professional tout they be attack everywhere from stadium gig to local venue and increasingly football game they should not be able to tout ticket for football game but they do yet accord to home office figure the yearly arrest of football ticket tout have be decrease drop from in to only in the season in my opinion the lone conviction of just two tout nearly four year ago which we discuss with the minister in the last debate on this bill be not strong enough deterrent especially as it rely on outdated legislation such as the companies act and the fraud act rather than the purpose build consumer rights act which be substantially involve in or the digital economy act appreciate the effort in the bill to protect consumer online and can see that there be measure in the bill to be welcome but for ticket touting and the widespread fraud that come with it must be properly address and regulatory body must be fully empower to tackle these site will leave my remark there when first announce this bill the prime minister promise that it would clamp down on greenwashe and bring misleading environmental claim under the umbrella of consumer protection law but the reality seem to fall far short of that something to which we should perhaps have become accustomed when contemplate the gap between this government environmental rhetoric and their lack of concrete action while the bill allow for consumer redress if commercial practice result in their being mislead confused or misinformed the measure it contain certainly do not amount to the robust action on greenwashe that the prime minister lead we to believe would be forthcoming have therefore table two amendment that would go some way towards deliver on the promise that he make as multibillion pound persuasion industry advertising have an enormous influence on which company we trust on our lifestyle choice and on the purchase we all make we be all expose to thousand of advertisement on more or less daily basis to protect consumer from misinformation and harm advertising must be properly and fairly regulate however we currently have an advertising regulation system that be slow opaque and in short fail the uk advertising standards authority be not an independent regulator it be self fund by the advertising industry any complaint that the asa handle about misleading or harmful advertising be essentially therefore mark its own homework the asa motivation to fairly regulate be wholly undermine by its close proximity to the industry it should be hold accountable my amendment seek to address the regulatory gap as matter of urgency it would create regulator that be independent transparent and one that can take timely action thus well protect consumer from mislead messaging by polluter and other harmful commercial actor think consumer want action they be increasingly concerned about the role of company in produce waste pollution and environmental harm and ignore human right yet in response these same company turn to advertising to try to clean up their image and shore up their social licence to operate new evidence report in the financial times show that shell one of the world top polluter be estimate to have spend million on advertising in much of that advertising be aim at young generation who be perhaps more vulnerable to mislead claim mislead green advertising and greenwashing be on the rise the asa response have be to update its minimal environmental guidance to advertiser and to rule against just tiny number of advert for shell hsbc and other high carbon advertiser for make mislead green claim those ruling be often slow and be often make well after the damage have be do time consume complaint have largely be bring by civil society organisation concern with the impact of advertising and greenwashe on consumer wellbeing and their right but it should not be leave to those organisation to have to try to enforce misleading advert and to ensure that those advert do not go unchecked we need robust regulatory framework and it be disappointing that the government do not use the opportunity afford by the bill to deliver one the asa celebrate its slim count of investigation into polluter advertising while whole sea of greenwash escape its notice and seep into consumer consciousness only of advert report to the asa over environmental concern see any formal action in while thousand go unreported and therefore see no action at all this be drop in the ocean we simply can not afford this lack of effective advertising regulation to continue my amendment be small but essential step if we be to stop the most polluting advert from promote our own environmental demise my other amendment be it be another small but essential step this time towards tackle the way in which the advert to which we be expose to every day be themselves fuel the climate crisis the uk advertising industry be responsible for million tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emission in to put that another way advertising be responsible for the equivalent of just under third of the carbon footprint of every single person in the uk no wonder that from the world health organisation and the house of lords environment and climate change committee to the un environment programme and the committee on climate change there be universal agreement about the need to regulate the advertising of high carbon product high carbon clearly mean fossil fuel flight and suv would argue that it also probably mean fast fashion most meat and dairy and the bank fund the like of bp and shell therefore back the many campaign for ban on high carbon advertising and for interim measure such as car advertisement with mandatory content about the benefit of active travel and public travel as have be do in france in the meantime and in the absence of government prepare to act in line with the climate science and other evidence demand my amendment would bring consideration of net zero emission by into the consumer protection regime envisage by the government let say few word about why that be rather than the intergovernmental panel on climate change be clear that limit global temperature to require that the whole world reach net zero by deadline that have be directly translate into domestic target but the un secretary general for example be among many who have call for develop country to commit to net zero much soon by when we look at the uk own historic responsibility and indeed our financial mean that put we into the category of rich country that in the interest of fairness should be go fast and far give the rate at which we be eat through our remain carbon budget for accord to some scientist month far and fast in term of the uk translate to we achieve zero emission by much close to or thereby give country in the global south long to cut their emission this idea be actually enshrine in climate law around the idea of common but differentiated responsibility but sadly it be more respected in the avoidance rather than in the implementation of course that timeframe be undoubtedly hugely challenging it will require scale of social and economic transformation far surpass what we have see to date hence the need for action across the board include in relation to the advertising industry and consumer law specifically amendment would signal that achieve net zero by be in the collective interest of consumer and it would help protect consumer from any detrimental effect arise from commercial practice that do not fully reflect the need to stay within that limit mislead advertising be unfairly influence consumer who want to do the right thing to protect the environment it be delay climate action just when we need to shift consumption pattern towards low carbon alternative it be far flood consumer with advert that normalise and glamourise high carbon product and way of living something the regulator with its limited remit can not currently act upon and which the current limited understanding of consumer collective interest do not encompass the scale and urgency of the climate and nature crisis be such that they should be factor into every single piece of legislation my two amendment be design to do exactly that by deliver on the promise the prime minister make about greenwashe and by deliver on what every shred of evidence tell we about the impact of that advertising on our precious environment and therefore on consumer long term collective interest it be pleasure to follow the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas she be if may say so the conscience of the chamber in relation to net zero and environmental issue she always give we helpful reminder of the importance of those issue for all of we across this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland it have be incredibly encouraging to hear the comment make thus far by all member on all side of the house it be also great to see the intention of the bill which lie solely around the consumer and consumer right and protection the minister very helpfully set the scene in way we can all adhere to and agree with if the hon member for weston super mare john penrose put forward some of his amendment maybe the government will also support they if they do we will have no need to divide the house the new consumer protection measure in the bill be intend to apply to the whole of the uk consumer protection policy be devolve to northern ireland and reserve for scotland and wales it be my understanding that as result consent will be require for northern ireland it would be helpful if the minister could confirm what discussion he will have or have have with northern ireland departments to ensure that they can be implement as soon as possible read through the bill and the amendment and new clause that have be table be ever mindful that the government do have power in new clause for instance sectoral enactment be in place for the water and sewerage services northern ireland order the gas northern ireland order and the electricity northern ireland order there seem to be methodology whereby decision for northern ireland can be make again as an northern ireland mp think it be important that we understand what the implication be and how the process will work for we wish to refer to new clause and also to new clause which be table by the shadow minister and which seem to be perfectly amenable suggestion very much welcome the minister commitment in his opening speech to address the issue of fuel price number of right hon and hon member have refer to that matter clearly there be something wrong if the fuel price on one side of newtownards in my constituency be different from that on the other side but it be even more wrong if one of the major store have price at certain level yet far up the road that same store have different price it really be quite hard to comprehend how that can happen wish to highlight the subscription issue which many member have refer to today have be make aware of two example that wish to put on the record in hansard believe that these issue be be address the minister refer to that in his opening speech the fact be that we be now live in an online world be afraid that be not one of those who can do that make that admission here in this chamber but most people be involve in that world it be world where there be almost always an opportunity for subscription payment even newspaper now offer an online subscription service to get premium access to certain article these service be good if they be use correctly hear story from one of my member of staff one of her subscription be with an online clothing company which charge month for she to get access to clothe at significantly cheap rate at the start of the month for four day only there be an opportunity to skip the month and not pay the payment the issue quite simply be that if people forget to skip the month they be charge that there be something wrong with that no reminder be send by the company so this be smart way for company to make more money as be forgetful be human error again be keen to get the minister idea on whether this legislation address that issue prompt and reminder be key aspect of the clause on subscription the government estimate that subscription contract cost consumer billion year be pleased that the bill will put requirement on business to send reminder notice to consumer if subscription be due for renewal there be some good thing in the bill include on automatic renewal subscription another issue be that with many company there be no way to cancel subscription online refer to this matter briefly in my intervention on the minister at the start of the debate such cancellation must be do over the phone some constituent have tell that the phone process can be frustratingly long as it can take hour to get through to the call handler it be bit like when we phone department on behalf of people unless someone phone through to minister office they join queue that can take five or minute even when it be an mp many phone line be open only from be to pm monday to friday where do that leave consumer who work full time and who may not be available during the day to seek the answer that they need their only free time might be at weekend know that the minister always respond to our question which and many other greatly appreciate so would be interested to hear what he think to conclude be pleased that the bill address so many of the issue that our constituent experience but these matter must continue to be highlight think we have all mention some example ask the minister to engage regionally with northern ireland departments to ensure that the law around consumer right apply to northern ireland at the same time as they do to the mainland look forward to hear about that in due course and also about how we can all take advantage equally of the issue that have be raise in the house tonight so that across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we can all be equal citizen equal under the law and equally subject to the law thank right hon and hon member for their contribution to the debate and for their ongoing engagement first let speak to the amendment table by the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones who have thoroughly enjoy our engagement over the week that we have be study the bill new clause would impose requirement on trader to ask their customer whether they want their subscription to renew automatically every six month when they sign up to subscription contract if they do not choose this auto renewal option the contract would end after six month unless the customer expressly ask for it to continue new clause would apply equivalent requirement to contract that renew automatically after free or low cost trial the government agree that consumer must be protect from get trap in unwanted subscription however we do not think the new clause would deliver this in the right way and such an approach could end up inconvenience many consumer for example if consumer have not initially opt into an auto renewing contract but later decide that they want to keep the subscription they would have to repeatedly communicate that they want to continue their subscription or risk its unintentionally lapsing that risk could be multiply across each subscription they hold the new clause would also impose undue additional cost on business as my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg rightly state all regulatory cost end up be bear by consumer so we must approach regulation with extreme care the government approach strike the balance of protect consumer without compromise the benefit of roll subscription and the convenience they provide on amendment the government recently consult on tackle the practice of drip pricing and we will shortly set out the next step follow an assessment of the response it would be premature to amend the bill in advance of that turn to my hon friend the member for weston super mare john penrose agree with the instinct behind his idea to control the cost of red tape and regulatory burden in new clause and with many of the point make about this issue in his government commission report on competition policy and the subsequent month update that he publish suggest that together we can do well than what be set out in the new clause he too know that as my right hon friend the member for north east somerset say all regulation be ultimately pay for by consumer it be absolutely right that we look to minimise regulation and that we also recognise that the good form of regulation be competition which be what we be here to promote in his power to the people report my hon friend the member for weston super mare recommend one in two out solution it will be interesting to see where we can go with that everybody certainly on the government benches be concerned about regulation and the increase burden on business however if we look at some of the regulation that we impose on business in this be from better regulation government annual regulation be put in place cover thing such as make our telecommunication more secure against foreign actor climate relate financial disclosure and make home more efficient which think most people would acknowledge we should do as well as sanction against russian oligarch and the rest those regulation be not necessarily the burden that many member might consider they to be when we look at regulation we have to decide what be the right thing to do the right thing to leave the right thing to take out and the right thing to amend we have make start by update the well regulation framework with early scrutiny of regulatory proposal by the regulatory policy committee so that its advice can be apply before legislative solution have be settle on the update framework focus on design the least burdensome policy avoid regulation completely where possible and minimise cost and administrative burden where regulation be require in parallel to our call for evidence and forthcoming consultation we be seek to change the culture of regulation in the uk to be more pro growth and business friendly new clause propose some important further measure it would create much strong accountability for any future government who fail to control red tape cost properly it would plug an important historical loophole by include economic regulator in the well regulation framework and it would provide extra independence for the accountancy sector in report on change in regulatory burden so that government can not be accuse of mark their own homework as my hon friend put it however the new clause be constrain by the scope of the bill so it can not plug all the historical gap in the well regulation framework and it make the cma successor to the rpc when there may be well way to ensure enhanced independence as result would suggest well alternative approach any regime should recognise the economic benefit as well as cost of any change to regulation account for they be complex some be indirect some be externality and some take year to manifest or come to fruition individual regulator should take responsibility for report on their activity include what they have do to support the growth of the business they regulate as well as what additional burden they have create or remove and why in each case agree that we will need to establish target and metric to monitor the success of our regulator and of government departments in promote growth there be few legitimate exception from the rpc scrutiny process such as urgent or civil emergency measure but that should not mean whole area of the economy be exempt from its scrutiny otherwise we would leave loophole that mean cost be still not scrutinise and potential benefit be ignore although the rpc be already an independent scrutiny body agree that we should find way to ensure even strong and more independent measurement and reporting of change in regulatory benefit and burden without assume that the good or only answer be for the cma to take over this function as the new clause propose finally there must be strong accountability than at present for any government who fail to control regulatory burden properly although we do not think it be right to accept the new clause as it stand accept and agree with many of the thing it try to achieve therefore invite my hon friend to work with official and to develop well strong way of achieve his four aim through mixture of potential government amendment to the bill and other measure or statement of government policy to be release publicly before royal assent where the change fall outside the bill scope hope these proposal be acceptable and that he will not press the new clause amendment which be table by the hon member for gordon richard thomson seek to exclude lottery ticket purchase from non commercial society lottery from the scope of the provision on subscription contract we agree with he on this which be why we table government amendment to that effect thank he for his contribution new clause which be table by my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland would require the secretary of state to commission review of the competition appeal tribunal process independent of the cma and the dmu be grateful for his focus on this important matter and for the legal knowledge he bring to bear the competition appeal tribunal rules which set out the tribunal procedure require the secretary of state to carry out regular review of the rule and to publish their conclusion which last happen in april new clause would unnecessarily duplicate this work turn to new clause the cma overarch objective be to promote competition for the benefit of consumer and this must shape the design of its intervention and how it prioritise its work consumer duty would overlap with that objective and be in our view unnecessary new clause would extend the right to seek damage at the competition appeal tribunal to all infringement of part the bill already provide for consumer redress in respect of some provision of part additionally the private redress provision in part include the power for public enforcer to seek enhanced consumer measure include financial redress for consumer amendment would reduce the frequency with which trader must send reminder notice we share the intention of my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon to ensure that business and consumer be not overburden by reminder notice however we believe that this amendment would negatively impact consumer by increase the risk that they end up pay long for unwanted subscription we think that require trader to send reminder every six month strike the right balance amendment would create new power for the secretary of state to make reasonable provision relate to the content and timing of reminder notice amendment and would then remove exist provision relate to such matter from clause and schedule as my right hon and learn friend recognise we have table an amendment that provide power to amend these detail through regulation enable the government to respond should evidence of consumer behaviour or operational practice indicate that adjustment be necessary amendment to would remove requirement that be design to ensure trader provide easy and accessible mean for consumer to end their subscription contract instead principle would be set out to guide the arrangement put in place by trader and relevant provision would be make in secondary legislation the government be commit to ensure that consumer be not hinder when try to leave subscription contract or when try to stop subscription renewing the hon member for strangford jim shannon also raise that point that be the objective behind these provision and it be vital that they remain in the bill it be also critical that consumer have flexibility when end their contract rather than business dictate the communication channel such as phone cancellation only we appreciate that any communication to end contract must be sufficiently clear to business as be underline by government amendment that amendment make it clear that the onus be on the consumer to prove that their communication be sufficiently clear amendment to would remove the mandatory cool off period for subscription contract it be important to retain those provision as they provide essential protection for consumer the renewal cool off period protect consumer who have sign up to trial or long term contract that be particularly important since our consultation show that many people forget to cancel those subscription before they automatically renew we understand however that some business be concerned about how the cool off period will work in practice particularly for digital streaming service this be an important issue to get right so the government will publicly consult on the return and refund rule to ensure that they be fair and practical for business and consumer that will include consult on waiver of cool off right for some product amendment and would apply two year implementation period to the subscription contract provision in the bill the government fully understand that clarity be important so that business know when the new rule will come into effect and can make the appropriate preparation that be why we will continue to engage with stakeholder to understand the impact of implement these new rule let move on to the hon member for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle he and have be walk these street for so long amendment would ban in all circumstance the marketing of counterfeit and dangerous product online which be already offence under current consumer protection and product safety law the government be commit to strengthen enforcement of these law through the reform in part of the bill and recently consult on number of proposal in the product safety review amendment would confer on public enforcer the power to require removal of such material from the internet the government have consult on this issue with proposal to extend the power to apply for online interface order to all public enforcer the government will publish their response shortly finally the public safety review include proposal specifically aim at tackle the sale of unsafe good online we will publish response in due course the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg seek to add further anti discrimination law relate to payment account provision the government have be clear about the importance of protect lawful free speech it be unacceptable for bank and payment service provider to discriminate on the basis of lawfully hold political view and other such as pawnbroker as he mention consequently the government support the spirit of the amendment but do not believe that it be necessary principally because the government have take significant action to build on exist protection to resolve this issue since the amendment be table on october the chancellor commit to amend the threshold condition that financial service firm must meet in order to be authorise and to consult on how to deliver that it will ensure that bank uphold their current legal duty include requirement not to discriminate on the basis of political opinion therefore ensure freedom of speech safeguard will also be put in place to protect consumer bank will be require to put in place safeguard to protect consumer right include free speech and regulator will be require to act when they be not comply with in addition the government announce that the legal notice period for payment service contract termination will increase to day and payment service provider will be legally require to give consumer clear tailor explanation detail why they close their account thank the hon member for washington and sunderland west mrs hodgson for all her work on the all party parliamentary group on ticket abuse she raise the point about
