oral answers to questions health and social care the secretary of state be ask vaccine damage payment scheme what assessment he have make of the adequacy of the vaccine damage payment scheme reiterate my deep sympathy to all those who have experience harm follow vaccination and to their family recognise many of the concern that campaigner have raise regard the vaccine damage payment scheme their input will shape our ongoing consideration of reform to the scheme and will keep parliament update as appropriate my constituent kelly hatfield sadly lose her father ken purnell as result of the vaccination the family receive vaccine damage payment yet the sum which have not increase since fall short of the loss trauma and long term financial impact on these family will the minister explain why that one off payment have not be inflation adjust and will she commit to review its adequacy and fairness the vaccine damage payment scheme be not compensation scheme but one off payment it be important to state that as have say we recognise that there be concern which campaigner have raise and their input be shape our ongoing consideration of reform to the scheme all vaccine in the uk be authorise by the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency which be an independent body recognise globally for its high safety standard this labour government base our decision on scientific fact unlike reform which have still not apologise for platforme dangerous anti vax conspiracy theory can only assume that it be less interested in protect people than it be in alarm folk for political advantage nhs trust performance what step he be take to help improve the performance of the most underperforming nhs trust this government have invest an extra billion in the nhs deliver million more appointment in our first year and cut waiting list by more than we be also tackle the nhs postcode lottery patient should not have to wait long for bad care because of where they live our new nhs league table shine light on the poor performer so they receive the extra support and accountability need to turn they around the good leader be be send into the most challenge trust to turn they around fail manager will have their pay dock and persistent failure will lead to restriction on board as we see in leeds this week we will not tolerate failure in telford and wide shropshire we know that the nhs have an absolute mountain to climb after year of underperformance we have begin that journey with fall waiting time increase government investment and plan for telford first ever cancer treatment unit will the secretary of state ensure that trust that show sign of improvement be back to catch up with the rest and continue their improvement particularly with investment in technology research and infrastructure absolutely my hon friend deserve real credit for championing telford and shropshire and help to get the trust the investment it need he be right that local service have not be good enough for number of year we will not turn blind eye to that failure we will do something about it there be long way to go but we have already deliver an extra appointment and cut waiting list by over at his local trust since the general election so lot do but lot more to do see the health secretary be have bust up with the chancellor over who pay his billion redundancy bill for break up nhs england will he guarantee that once he have resolve his difference with the chancellor not single penny will be take from deliver frontline health and social care service or from underperform nhs trust to pay for make staff redundant the hon gentleman should not believe everything he read in the newspaper make no apology for try to cut unnecessary bureaucracy in large national organisation to redeploy saving to frontline service his government really should have take leaf out of our book the secretary of state need look no far than homerton university hospital in hackney for good performance it have manage to increase productivity by over what be he do to support great leader who deliver great progress and to make sure that they have the funding they need to continue with that be delighted to meet my hon friend only recently to hear about the really impressive productivity gain be make at her local trust be keen to learn more we need to incentivise and reward leader for that kind of outstanding performance and we also need to get some of that good practice to some of our poor performing trust oxford university hospital trust be one of just three trust that do not provide givinostat for duchenne through the early access programme last week attend roundtable at which one of my constituent alex advocate on behalf of his son ben who be not get the treatment we discuss lesson learn from the early access programme will the secretary of state meet duchenne uk and the all party parliamentary group on access to medicine and medical device so that we can share those lesson with he have have the privilege of meet some of the campaigner and particularly the young people affect by that cruel condition and understand the hon gentleman frustration know that the medication be be put through the national institute for health and care excellence process and hope that that will deliver positive outcome would be delighted to keep he apprise of progress can just suggest to members that their supplementary question should relate to the tabled question that would be helpful call the shadow minister with report of over billion in cost for integrate care board redundancy and the chief executive officer of nhs england warning that service could have to move to plan could the secretary of state set out what plan be we be absolutely committed to deliver the transformation that we have outline and we be work with icb leader and nhs leader to do that in timely way those saving will deliver well value for money and enable we to redeploy resource to the frontline where they belong thank the secretary of state for his answer but waiting list have rise for three successive month now doctor be on strike gps be in formal dispute with the government and the icb be cut of their staff and do not have billion to pay for it all while the nhs year plan have be publish but with no delivery chapter when will the secretary of state come to the house with the delivery plan for the nhs year plan not only have the conservatives fail to get in the news but they have clearly not be read it either there have be no doctor strike in the nhs since before the summer and we have sit down with resident doctor and their new leadership to try to avert future strike action the hon gentleman be right to point out that the action take by the previous committee unnecessary and irresponsible as it be have impact on waiting list in the last few month as have high level of demand than anticipate say that by way of explanation by the way not by way of excuse be determined to make sure that we hit our target as outline in the government plan for change and think he will find that in the come month we will be back on track and well on course to achieve something that the conservatives fail to do when they have the chance maternity and neonatal care what step his department be take to improve maternity and neonatal care be deeply concerned by the state of maternity care that we inherit in the nhs that be why have ask baroness amos to chair an independent investigation into nhs maternity and neonatal service family deserve truth and justice there must be accountability for failing and service must improve be commit to do whatever it take to provide patient and baby with safe comfortable and dignified care should also inform the house that this week have announce an inquiry into failing at the leeds teach hospital trust be work with the family affect to agree on chair and term of reference and will keep the house update on next step pregnancy can be worrying time for any expectant parent and know they can access their gp to see person face to face be hugely important that be deny to my constituent hayley johnson who sadly go on to lose her baby evelyn when she be deliver in an emergency at week and six day due to huge misdiagnosis give over the phone with regard to maternity support specifically what be the minister do to ensure that excellent maternity care be deliver in local community so that that never happen to another family and that when the very bad do happen and parent be suffer the loss of baby the support also extend to bereavement counselling thank my hon friend for the work she be do to campaign for well support in this space and for raise these tragic case not just today but in her powerful contribution to last week debate she be right to say that gps be critical for support woman during pregnancy provide compassionate physical and mental health care and signpost relevant service which be why continuity be important be happy to report to she that in term of mental health and bereavement support record number of woman access specialist community perinatal mental health service or maternal mental health service in the month to july but clearly there be much more to do we have announce million package for bespoke perinatal mental health and parent infant relationship support as part of the continuation of the family hub and start for life programme but as we hear in last week debate although lot have be do there be so much more to do safe maternity care depend on adequate staffing and we on these benches have be call for well recruitment and retention of staff in woman health service for long time now can the secretary of state outline what specific measure the government be take to address the shortage of midwife and specialist neonatal nurse across england we need to make sure that there be well staffing and that we have the right people in the right place should just caution the house though because in recent year there have be an increase in staffing but not corresponding increase in the quality of care so we have to make sure we be look at this issue in nuanced way it be about have the right staff in the right place at the right time to deliver safe maternity and perinatal service and that be exactly what we will do call the liberal democrat spokesperson our maternity ward be in state of crisis with death and injury rise at an alarming rate sadly this issue be not confine to shropshire and there have be steady drumbeat of maternity scandal with review after review find consistent failing across the nhs can the secretary of state explain to and the many mother have meet who have face tragedy and unacceptable trauma why the government be cut national service development funding ringfence funding to improve maternity care by more than and why the immediate and essential action from the ockenden review into the failing at shrewsbury and telford hospital trust which be to be implement nationwide be still not in place more than three year later we really be not what we have do be devolve funding and responsibility to local level which we think be the right thing to do if may say so it be quite irresponsible to suggest that maternity funding and funding for service have be cut in the way that the hon lady describe think it cause unnecessary concern we be take into account the recommendation make by donna ockenden as well as wide range of other review and inquiry as part of baroness amos rapid investigation because like the hon member want to see rapid improvement in maternity service across the country child hospices ringfence funding whether he have make an assessment of the potential merit of increase ringfenced nhs funding for child hospice to million by child hospice provide crucial support but for too long they have face the cliff edge of annual funding cycle be really proud that we have provide certainty with three year funding settlement of million give child hospice the stability and predictability they need to plan properly and focus on care for seriously ill child and their family and love one be sure that the hon member will join in welcome the certainty that we have deliver for the sector absolutely welcome the government announcement last week that funding for child hospice will be extend for the next three year and will rise in line with inflation julia house be one such hospice that serve family in my constituency however child hospice still face challenge in access funding from local nhs body and council address workforce shortage and hold integrate care board to account for the way in which they commission child palliative care so what reassurance can the minister give that child hospice will benefit from sustainable financial support both now and in the future be delighted that julia house hospice receive from the allocation be sure that be very welcome to the staff and the family it be also worth note that of the million allocation that we make to capital funding million go to child hospice that be an increase on top of what we have just be talk about of course there be challenging time for funding but we have also provide the sector with huge amount of certainty and stability this funding be welcome but hospice such as mountbatten in my area be still make cut because of the budgetary choice that the chancellor make and icb practice this be multi year funding settlement but multi year funding settlement need to be long will the minister commit to include all hospice in long multi year funding settlement for stability in the sector find it quite extraordinary that opposition members come to this house and lecture we on the sustainability of funding give the way in which they crash the economy and leave we in dire fiscal position would have hop that the hon gentleman would welcome the fact that rather than the annual funding cliff edge that they leave for vital child hospice service we have move to three year funding settlement his criticism beggar belief new hospital programme what progress his department have make on the implementation of the new hospital programme the conservative government promise of new hospital by be fantasy there be no funding beyond last march in january we publish realistic plan that put the programme on credible and sustainable footing we be committed to deliver all the scheme in the programme and be move at pace with funding in place for design work construction activity and business case development the conservative still have not apologise for the appalling state that they leave our nhs in torbay hospital be the third old hospital in the united kingdom it have tower block wreathe in scaffold to stop bit of it fall off rather than it be under repair and it have sewage leak throughout sadly it need significant investment which have be kick into the long grass senior manager describe the situation only this week as dire will the minister meet and hospital representative to explore how we can achieve the investment to turn this round the hon member make an excellent point it be echo by lord darzi in his report about the state of our hospital and know many hon member have similar problem have visit many such hospital and would be happy to discuss the matter with he far remind he that of course the torbay and south devon nhs foundation trust have be provide with million from the estate safety fund for work at the hospital and we be absolutely committed to ensure that it will be develop in line with the programme nhs reorganisation what recent progress he have make on reorganise the nhs we be put the final nail in the coffin of the hon member party disastrous lansley reorganisation so bad that it make become an mp we be abolish the world big quango nhs england along with other body the question be why do the conservatives not do that when they have the chance yesterday meet lila sixth form student at coombe dean school who raise the issue of long waiting list for mental health service for child and young people across devon what action have be take as result of the government policy of reorganise the nhs to reduce the unacceptable delay in mental health diagnosis and treatment for child and young people particularly in constituency such as south west devon all of we as constituency mp be fully aware of the state of mental health service particularly for young people which be why my hon friend the minister for care be work at pace on our manifesto commitment to support young people particularly through school we also understand the difficulty that her icb in particular have with its financial situation something we be also target as part of our reform to ensure that icb develop service for local people in line with the expectation that we have set they likewise in york child and adolescent mental health service be just not work for child who be leave on waiting list often with no management or treatment in order really to achieve reorganisation in our nhs would our government look at local authority commission mental health service to deliver such service and to meet the holistic need of young child development and mental health wellbeing again echo comment on the state of mental health service as the hon member have do as it say in our manifesto we be commit to those extra mental health support worker in local area such as hers it be important that commissioner work closely with their local authority on mental health service and know my hon friend the minister for care be ensure that that happen as part of the reform we be undertake call the shadow minister be concerned that the disruption cause by an uncosted unplanned simultaneous reorganisation of nhs england and the icbs be affect patient care before the summer the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation recommend that the rsv vaccine should be give to those over and those in adult care home in july ask the secretary of state to confirm that this vaccine will be available in time for the winter season and he say can certainly reassure the shadow minister on this official report july vol the winter vaccine programme start three week ago why have he not deliver on his promise we have as my right hon friend have just say we have deliver on that commitment the hon member talk about the reorganisation be distraction if her party have focus taxpayer money on patient service rather than ballooning bureaucracy with cost increase both among provider and through icb we would not have inherit the mess that we do and would be able to roll out programme more effectively we have commit to do that thank the hon lady for her answer but would like she to check and perhaps update the guidance for gps and the website that continue to say that it be only available to year old who turn after september which be not all people over the age of reorganisation be affect delivery elsewhere too the secretary of state also promise that the continue roll out of fracture liaison service would be one of his first priority how many new fracture liaison service have open since the general election on the hon lady first point this government unlike the previous government do believe in expert and we follow the clinical advice that we be give on her second point as she be so keen on read our manifesto commitment the commitment be to do that by it be currently our reform to icb and provider bring nhs england inside the department of health and social care to make it more democratically accountable for taxpayer will reverse the shocking increase in funding that the previous government put into leaky bucket we be fix the foundation of the nhs we be target resource at people in line with our year plan wait time online services what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of nhs online on wait time the nhs online hospital will connect patient with clinician anywhere in england through the nhs app it will deliver up to million appointment in its first three year four time more than the average nhs trust finally bring the nhs into the digital age we be cut waiting time and provide patient with more choice and convenience the wellbeing of our nation young people remain in crisis with one in five have probable mental health condition and the number be refer to emergency mental health care continue to rise in community like mine in croydon east where young people be wait month and sometimes even year for help family be desperate for support how will nhs online help young people access the mental health support they need and what impact will it have on reduce the waiting time for child and adolescent mental health service thank my hon friend for bring this crucial issue to light early access to high quality support be critical for young people struggle with their mental health that be back by we with an extra million this year we be hire more staff expand support team in school and boost support in new young futures hub so that child can get the good possible start in life although initially not focus on camhs the scope of the nhs online hospital be personal priority for the prime minister and have the capacity to grow and we will consider incorporate it when safely able to alongside other service whatever the impact of these new online service the opposition front bench team have draw attention to the fact that waiting list in england have rise for the last three month can inform the house this morning that waiting list in scotland be come down would the minister like to explain why that be the case be so glad the hon gentleman take the time to ask that question because while we invest in digital service scotland and scottish patient be still wait for the most basic digital infrastructure while we invest record amount in scotland budget the snp excuse keep rise what he need to answer be why scottish patient be live in digital desert while patient here in england be get more and more sophisticated nhs digital service cancer diagnoses what step his department be take to reduce the time take for cancer diagnosis this government be invest an extra billion in the nhs open up community diagnostic centre at evening and weekend and deliver million more appointment to catch cancer early we be make progress more patient have already have cancer diagnose or rule out within the day target compare with the previous year lot do and lot more to do local teacher go to her gp with clear symptom of facial tumour but be tell it be simply the effect of age it take almost two year to receive confirm diagnosis include eight month lose in the system after an urgent referral do the minister agree that reduce time for cancer diagnosis must start with strengthen system to support early recognition and follow up so that no one be leave wait wish the minister well with her own cancer battle and thank she for bravely share her experience of live with cancer thank my hon friend for her question and her well wish we be take cancer detection seriously in general practice and there be work to do it be why we have recently launch jess rule which be patient safety initiative that mean when patient return three time with worsen or undiagnosed symptom gps must reflect review and rethink that could include second opinion episodic continuity of care or order additional test wish her constituent the very good and offer she my sympathy in her diagnosis the government claim that they wish to reduce nhs waiting time but have write confirmation from the government that they have slash funding for community diagnostic centre the consequence of labour funding cut mean that brand new facility such as those at queen mary hospital in sidcup for which secure million of funding from the last conservative government can now open only two day per week will the minister urgently review that funding cut so that more patient in bexley and across the uk can get their diagnostic quick thank the hon gentleman for his question but think he might be mistake we be open more cdc than ever before have lose count of the amount of cdc we have be invite to open and we be make sure that people have access to diagnostic in their community from hospital to community with the most access that there have be for some year employer national insurance gps what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the increase in employer national insurance contribution on general practice thank to the decision take by the chancellor at the budget we be invest an extra billion in general practice the big increase in decade that funding have allow we to recruit an extra gps agree contract for the first time in four year and introduce online access do the hon member welcome that investment or would she cut it gps surgery across the weald of kent include in woodchurch and charing tell how much they struggle with rise staff cost and the national insurance increase in last year budget put huge pressure on they alongside the investment that the hon gentleman just mention what discussion have he or his colleague from the department of health and social care have with treasury colleague about protect gp partnership from further ni burden in the upcoming budget again find it extraordinary that conservative members have the brass neck to ask those kind of question they create the mess and now they be criticise we it be bit like the arsonist heckle the firefighter patient satisfaction in general practice have rise from last year to this year and the proportion of patient report difficulty contact their practice have fall from in july to in may we be just get start and do not hear the hon lady welcome the investment acute myeloid leukaemia what step his department be take to support people with acute myeloid leukaemia this government be commit to improve survival for blood cancer include acute myeloid leukaemia we be raise awareness deliver more research and improve early diagnosis blood cancer be the third big cancer killer and the fifth most common cancer in the uk that be why we be committed to develop national cancer plan with patient at its heart cover the cancer plan from referral and diagnosis to treatment and ongoing care have consult with key stakeholder and patient group confirm that that plan will be publish early in the new year thank the minister for her response my constituent ruth wake who live in brewood be tragically diagnose with acute myeloid leukaemia in january last year she have go through chemotherapy and stem cell transplant and while she have make good process and be in remission sadly the stem cell transplant have fail after nine and half month under the current rule if it fail in under year she can not have second stem cell transplant know the pressure that the minister be under in term of her time but my constituent have so little time could she look at this particular case and also look at guideline from the national institute for health and care excellence which be write over year ago science and treatment have move so rapidly and wonder if the minister could look at both those point thank the right hon gentleman for his question and offer my good wish to his constituent ruth in her treatment thank he for bring her story to my attention really do appreciate perhaps more than most the urgency of the matter although be unable to comment on individual case understand that one of my ministerial colleague will be write to the right hon gentleman directly on this matter in the very near future this week we learn about the incredible result of the galleri trial which allow the early identification of many tumour by look at dna circulate in the blood indeed be volunteer in this trial will the secretary of state join in recognise the central importance of medical research absolutely the new progress particularly around circulate tumour dna be really interesting and we be move forward with more investment in research so that we can bring forward more such treatment patient access to gps what recent step he have take to increase access to gp appointment what step his department be take to improve patient access to gps we strengthen the nhs front door with billion for general practice the big cash increase in over decade we promise to recruit an extra gps in our first year we recruit patient be now able to request appointment online which be huge step towards deliver our manifesto commitment to end the am scramble great western park have add home to didcot in my oxfordshire constituency and valley park which be under construction will add more however the new gp surgery promise in remain barren patch of land and exist facility can not cope the integrate care board be supportive but progress have stall due to nhs england involvement do the secretary of state agree with that integrate care board should have the authority to direct primary care funding and will he meet to help to unblock the new gp surgery my constituent desperately need let come back to the hon gentleman after have find out what have go wrong in this case as he point out icb be responsible for commission planning secure and monitor gp service within their health system through delegate responsibility from nhs england and capital be allocate to icb on basis that take account of annual population growth can understand his frustration and that of his constituent so let find out what have go wrong and come back to he after year of conservative government poor access to gps be something that we have come to know well in certain area of my constituency of sherwood forest in hucknall demand for gp appointment be overwhelming to the point that one practice have have to close its online system promise of super healthcare system be make by the previous government but never deliver meanwhile local ashfield independent politician have disgracefully use this as political football do the secretary of state agree with that there have be far too much talk and not enough action and that it be now time that both the integrate care board and ashfield district council deliver on this it be of no surprise to that my hon friend raise yet another example of conservative broken promise and the hot air that come from independent who have all the luxury of be commentator but none of the responsibility of ever have to deliver anything would be happy to meet she to look into what have go wrong here this have go on for far too many year and can well understand her frustration public private partnerships what step he be take to ensure that frontline nhs service be support follow the potential introduction of new public private partnership contract let be clear this government will always protect the nhs and have the service free at the point of use for everyone this government be determined to shift health out of hospital and into the community as set out in the year plan and neighbourhood health service will be fundamental to deliver this shift so it be right that we look at range of option to provide the good care for people across the country let reassure hon member that all proposal be subject to robust value for money assessment to ensure taxpayer get the good possible return on investment in our health service may begin by congratulate the secretary of state on his action in try to repair our cherished nhs follow year of tory destruction we must learn from past mistake the private finance initiative be huge expensive mistake an absolute disaster with billion repay for an investment of billion will the minister reassure the house that the lesson of pfi have be well learn and that they be well and truly in the past and in the dustbin thank my hon friend for his word of encouragement and congratulation assure he that lesson have be learn we will ensure value for taxpayer money in all future proposal meet regularly with gps in my constituency and they have highlight that they do not yet have clarity or certainty about the role and resource that they will have in the roll out of service from hospital to community and neighbourhood health service will the minister meet to provide that clarity to our gps and assure they that they will be at the table during that roll out it be absolutely the role of the hon lady local integrate care board to ensure that it involve all partner particularly primary care in the exciting roll out of neighbourhood health service which think they welcome be happy to discuss that far with she health service spending what step his department be take to tackle wasteful spending in the health service as well as the record investment that we put into the nhs we be ensure that we get well bang for the taxpayer buck under the conservatives for example the nhs be pay billion to recruitment firm for agency shift we have cut agency spending by third and be abolish it altogether with the saving reinveste in staff pay and treatment for patient that be just one example of how our reform agenda be good for patient and for taxpayer private finance initiative deal do huge damage to nhs budget despite receive just billion in asset nhs trust be saddle with more than billion in pfi debt most of that be still be pay back we have even see some hospital spend more on pfi debt than on medicine if they really want to cut out waste and avoid pfi style disaster will the government rule out use private finance for the new network of new nhs clinic as have be float as answer in response to my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery we will absolutely ensure that we learn the lesson of the last government failure do the minister agree that it be completely wasteful to make cancer patient who need to go for chemotherapy in carlisle on wednesday but who live in say kirkby stephen to have to travel to carlisle on the day or on the day before to get their blood take why be that because the local hospital will no long fund the local gp surgery in kirkby stephen or appleby to take their blood there be it not wrong that those gp surgery can no long provide secondary healthcare blood service in their own setting in people own community as he often do the hon gentleman highlight in his own very rural constituency some of the fundamental problem at the heart of our nhs that be why we be reform it ensure that we move hospital service from hospital into the community and develop neighbourhood health service we be also look at the financial flow in the system that lead to these sort of perverse incentive and funding arrangement which do damage to his constituent as they do to many other and to rural and coastal community that be why we highlight that in the year plan we need to see the end of such example nhs menopause treatment what step he be take to ensure that woman have access to menopause treatment on the nhs we have already make excellent progress turn commitment in the woman health strategy into tangible action we be deliver million extra appointment which include tackle gynaecology waiting list we know though that more need to be do for woman experience the menopause and on improve awareness and access to treatment menopause mandate have long campaign alongside many member in this house for the menopause to be include in the nhs health check hope to be able to say more soon but rest assure that we have hear those call early this year constituent come to speak to about shortage of the one hormone replacement therapy drug that be work for she after year of misdiagnose and ineffective treatment she tell that gps have very low awareness of menopause and often recommend alternative that cause adverse reaction leave she and many other woman pay for private advice and treatment and take time off work will the minister update the house on what the department be do to address hrt shortage and to improve training for gps so that million of woman get the support that they need thank my hon friend for highlight this crucial issue the majority of the more than hrt product be in good supply but we be aware of shortage affect certain estradiol patch and we be engage with supplier to expedite delivery wherever we can we have issue guidance to healthcare professional under the serious shortage protocol methodology to enable community pharmacist to supply alternative where appropriate furthermore we be commit to fund research into woman health and we have invest approximately million through the national institute for health and care research scheme into menopause research include study for new treatment to improve outcome for woman experience the menopause it be be report in the press this week that woman be be exploit by menopause gold rush enable by tech giant such as instagram what step can be take to ensure that woman have access to the very good of information and that misinformation on the internet be bring under control thank the hon lady for highlight this issue the good way to do that be to beef up nhs digital service as we be do to the nhs digital app so that woman and all patient can have confidence in the advice that they receive virtual wards what step he have take to support the virtual ward programme welcome the chair of the select committee back from parental leave and greatly look forward to work with she again virtual ward allow patient to get hospital level care in the comfort of their own home speed up their recovery while free up hospital bed for the patient who need they most we be roll out virtual ward far so that they become the norm for manage many condition at home early this year visit the hospital at home team at the john radcliffe hospital who run an incredible virtual ward see they deliver care to mavis who be she be so emotional and grateful for the work they do we all end up in tear imagine my disappointment that while be off we get an email from the team say that the funding for that incredible service be no long there and that they face closure this be an example of the good of the nhs we want it roll out to the rest but if the funding be not there for these nascent service to find their footing how can we ensure that good practice can be spread across the whole of oxfordshire and beyond the hon lady make very valid point this be about the shift from hospital to community which we have to drive forward in september virtual ward bed be available an increase from in september slowly but surely we be increase the number of virtual ward bed and the capability of virtual ward but there be still long way to go absolutely accept the point that the hon lady make hospital to community care what step he be take to transfer care from hospital into the community the darzi investigation find that nhs resource be too focused on hospital at the expense of community care our reform will turn the nhs into more of neighbourhood health service we have already recruit an extra more gps we be roll out extra dental appointment and we have agree new contract of investment and reform for community pharmacy as part of our year plan we will be roll out neighbourhood health centre across the country start with the place that be in the great need thank my hon friend for his answer and for the brilliant work that the whole team be do to put the nhs year plan into action transfer care into the community will give many more patient quick and easy access to specialist care when they need it however access to parkinson nurse who be worth their weight in gold remain deeply unequal too often patient be leave without nurse and have to travel long way to see specialist nurse worse still the few parkinson nurse who be available be predominantly fund by parkinson uk can the minister set out what step be be take to increase equitable access to parkinson nurse across the country thank my hon friend for that question and congratulate he on his work campaign on this issue regular support and advice from parkinson disease nurse specialist be highlight as key intervention in the national institute for health and care excellence guideline on parkinson disease in adult the forthcoming year workforce plan will support the year health plan by address workforce shortage and skill gap this will be crucial to deliver quality and accessible care for those with parkinson ironically get care out of hospital and into the community very much depend on function hospital last month meet the group chief executive officer of hull university teaching hospital nhs trust follow news that it have be place in segment of the nhs acute trust league table she acknowledge the urgent need for improvement and express clear ambition for change but she will not be able to deliver the transformation of that important hospital alone could meet the secretary of state or ministers to discuss what more can be do to support that hospital on its road to transformation and improvement thank the right hon gentleman for his question be not familiar with the detail of that case but if he would not mind write to would be very happy to take that issue forward he be right that there be mountain to climb not least because of the mess that be leave to we by the previous government but we be climb that mountain step by step the year plan be big step in the right direction it be now all about delivery and that be what we be do every day topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility since last answer question in this house the government have announce half billion pound for fair pay agreement for care worker nhs online the first ever online only hospital trust and million for child hospice we have announce an independent inquiry into maternity service in leeds introduce jess rule implement online request for gp appointment open the community diagnostic centre make the chickenpox vaccine available on the nhs and publish nhs league table lot do lot more to do we promise million more appointment and we have deliver million along with extra gps more mental health worker more doctor and more nurse and midwife the cancer diagnosis standard have be meet gp satisfaction be up and waiting list be down the brand new midland metropolitan university hospital have open in my constituency do the secretary of state agree that this be the difference that labour government make and that we be only just get start why stop there we have more home adaptation for disabled people through the disabled facility grant and more suspect cancer patient receive diagnosis on time we have more than case off the waiting list million for the first ever fair pay agreement for care worker and the big uplift in carer allowance for generation the tories do not do it and reform would undo it that be the difference that labour government make call the shadow secretary of state first it be great to be in this new role genuinely want to be part of constructive opposition but equally want to do my role in hold this government to account note the lack of detail in the secretary of state answer on reorganisation so can ask the basic again how many people will be make redundant what will it cost and who be pay welcome the shadow secretary of state to his place it be good to hear from the conservative front benchers have almost forget they exist the conservatives create complex web of bureaucracy it be bit rich to complain we be not abolish their creation quickly enough we have have number of expression of interest in voluntary redundancy across my department nhs england and the integrated care board and we be work through that as we speak again the secretary of state can not answer his answer be too vague he be very good at make promise but the fact be that he be preside over reorganisation that have stall create uncertainty for staff waiting list be up in the past three month hospice be in crisis because of national insurance contribution rise and we have have strike again despite big pay rise with the threat of more if the secretary of state want the leadership in the future perhaps he should show leadership in the nhs now and tell we not just the plan but when he will give the detail and how he will deliver on his promise to patient waiting list be low now than when labour take office and that be in stark contrast with the record of the government in which the shadow secretary of state serve waiting list increase every single year they be in charge this be the first year in that waiting list have fall that be the difference that labour government make we be only just get start as for leadership change we all know why they be call the leader of the opposition kemi kaze channel dispatches documentary recently go undercover at an ambulance centre in my constituency of gillingham and rainham it show exhausted staff work under difficult circumstance the result of year of tory neglect and mismanagement of our nhs do my right hon friend agree that after the chaos under the last government this administration will put staff and patient first will the relevant minister come to my constituency to meet healthcare provider and discuss our local challenge we know that there have be issue with the urgent emergency care response we be absolutely committed to support ambulance trust to continually improve the patient experience the urgent emergency care plan for be back by nearly million of funding be happy to discuss that far with my hon friend call the liberal democrat spokesperson every year we come here to discuss the winter crisis in the nhs but this summer see record wait at accident and emergency with more than hour trolley wait in june and july that use to be unheard of with winter loom and the potential for the permacrisis to be even bad this year what package of emergency measure be the secretary of state put in place to ensure that patient be not leave to suffer on trolley or bad in our hospital corridor this winter the hon lady be absolutely right to point out that the nhs be already run hot ahead of winter we bring forward our winter planning for this year to get ahead we be make sure that all nhs trust and system have develop plan that have be test regionally the flu vaccination programme be well under way the autumn vaccination begin on october and we be drive improvement in urgent and emergency care this will be challenging winter we be not complacent about that but we be get the system ready for it after year of watch dentist in cumbria turn their back on the nhs contract and move those patient who can afford it to private plan my constituency be now an nhs dental desert can the minister confirm when the government will publish their response to the consultation on quality and payment reform and tell we what we can expect to see in it as my hon friend will know the consultation close on august we be now consider the outcome and expect to publish response very shortly these reform will improve support for patient with complex or urgent need by well incentivising dentist to deliver this care on the nhs moya cole in heald green be shin example of hospice that do fantastic work in very tough economic situation but it should not have to rely on coffee morning and jumble sale to fund its most essential service liberal democrat research finding show that almost half of hospice in the united kingdom be plan cut this year will the government commit themselves to fund our hospice properly in the upcoming budget so that they do not need to cut the vital service that they provide do not hear the hon gentleman welcome the fact that we provide million an unprecedented amount in capital funding for hospice and million year and million over three year for child hospice we recognise that hospice benefit from be root in their community with amazing charity and philanthropy support but of course we know that the government need to do their bit as well and that be precisely what we be do be very pleased to visit noah ark child hospice in barnet last week and to speak to the chief executive who warmly welcome the stability and certainty that the three year allocation have provide after decade of under investment in our nhs under the conservatives welcome the progress that have be make on reduce waiting time under this government but there be no immediate fix just last month coffee shop at the william harvey hospital in ashford be convert into an emergency ward to treat patient will the secretary of state visit the hospital to see the continue problem with corridor care and will he update the house on what the government be do to ensure that the hospital can manage winter pressure and maintain safe high quality care be grateful to my hon friend for bring this matter to the house attention it be appal for coffee shop to be commandeer as space for the care of patient and we will not accept it be happy to look at the case that my hon friend have mention we will also be publish figure on corridor care so that we can hold the system to account and the public can hold we to account to improve the situation that we inherit the arthur rank hospice in cambridgeshire be lose in nhs funding which be force the closure of nine of its capacity do the minister believe that die patient be care for well in overstretch hospital ward than in specialist hospice and will he please not fob off with talk of capital investment this be about operational cost as have point out we be provide unprecedented level of funding for hospice but there be clearly challenging fiscal position note that in their manifesto the liberal democrats propose to spend only an extra billion on health and care whereas we have invest billion before call for more spending they should tell we what they would cut welcome the change in the gp booking system but in many case it be still very difficult to obtain gp appointment on the isle of wight large factor in that be the difficulty of recruit gps to the island will the minister assure that he will investigate all option for improve gp recruitment to coastal rural and island community like mine through million investment in the additional role reimbursement scheme we have recruit more than new gps nationwide but we recognise the inequity in funding that can exacerbate regional inequality in access to service have launch review of the gp funding formula to ensure that funding follow the need of the population the national institute for health and care research have begin review of the carr hill funding formula which will conclude in six month time hinchingbrooke hospital be one of the few hospital in cambridgeshire that be yet to have an electronic patient record system and its current level of digital maturity be at the low end of the healthcare information and management systems society scale hospital within the new hospital programme be require to be at level on the himss scale in line with the national digital capability framework what financial assistance will be give to north west anglia nhs foundation trust to facilitate an investment case so that the rebuilt hinchingbrooke hospital have modern and enterprise wide electronic patient record system the hon gentleman draw to our attention the appalling state that the nhs be leave in by the previous government we be work at pace to introduce epr across the system be sure that ministers would be happy to look at the case at his local hospital to clean up the mess that the conservative party leave behind as migraine sufferer be afflict about once week by debilitate symptom which always include partial blindness and sometimes include numbness in my finger nausea brain fog sensitivity to light and sound pound headache and even an inability to speak heartbreake for politician be very lucky though that my migraine generally only last half an hour other people can be much bad and last day what step be the minister take to improve support for migraine sufferer like at national level number of initiative support service improvement and well care for patient with migraine the get it right first time neurology programme publish national specialty report that make several recommendation to improve recognition and diagnosis of migraine by gps additionally the rightcare toolkit set out key priority for improve care for patient with migraine include correct identification and diagnosis and nhs england have

pathways clinical trial within day of take office uphold the judgment make by my predecessor we need to tread carefully and be sensitive in this space we need to take an evidence base approach to trans healthcare in our country and that be the approach that this government will take as you may be aware mr speaker reform lead lancashire county council have open consultation on the future of care home across lancashire include the proposal to close woodlands care home in my constituency of hyndburn will the minister join in urge lancashire county council not to take forward these proposal to protect much value local service and to keep care close to the community and to the amazing staff who support our resident in woodlands care home absolutely agree it have be very interesting to see

all those over and those in adult care home the secretary of state reassure this house in july that the recommendation have be accept and provision would be in place for this winter when ask about that today the secretary of state say from sedentary position that he have deliver on that promise and the minister for secondary care then confirm that however government and nhs guideline still show that availability of the vaccine have not be extend how can ensure that the record be correct first of all you can not continue the debate but you have certainly put that on the record on point of order mr speaker before begin my question mean to pay tribute to our former colleague oliver colvile who sadly pass away last night he serve as the member for plymouth sutton and devonport between and and be name by conservative home as one of minority of conservative mps not to have vote against the government which as previous whip think be exceptional he be true gentleman whose eccentricity endear he to many be sure the thought of the whole house be with his family we all remember oliver colvile very fondly he really be good mp and nice kind of guy to meet know oliver way before he come to this house we be all sadden to hear the news far to that point of order mr speaker on behalf of the government and labour members associate myself fully with the remark of the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew oliver colvile be decent man and wonderful public servant we all share that view be sure that my hon friend on the labour benches will absolutely follow his example when it come to follow the whip far to that point of order mr speaker oliver colvile be love by member from across this house as it will soon be the anniversary dinner of the lords and commons cricket team it be worth remember one of the most famous wicket ever take when oliver colvile bowl and take that wicket in india on live television watch by ten of million have never see triumph like it he will be much miss he be always love and respect in this house his brother be the famous sky cricket commentator rape gangs national statutory inquiry urgent question to ask the home secretary to make statement on the recent criticism of the statutory inquiry into the rape gang scandal as state in my previous statement to the house on september and in my letter to the home affairs committee yesterday the government remain resolute in deliver baroness casey recommendation follow her national audit of group base child sexual exploitation and abuse these crime commit by groom gang be among the most horrific imaginable baroness casey report expose more than decade of institutional inaction and we be determined to ensure that such failure be never repeat central to our response be statutory national inquiry under the inquiries act it will oversee local investigation and will have full power to compel evidence it will also be time limit to three year to ensure that victim and survivor receive answer swiftly the inquiry will examine safeguard system accountability and intersection with ethnicity race and culture identify failure and good practice the inquiry will work alongside operation beaconport national police operation the appointment of the chair be at critical stage and we hope to confirm its conclusion soon victim and survivor have be at the heart of the process with trauma inform opportunity to share their view we have engage with they on the chair appointment and the term of reference which will be shape by the chair in public consultation with stakeholder as have be widely report in the medium victim and survivor be meet prospective chair this week today in fact this process contrary to the reporting be manage not by the home office but by the independent child exploitation charity nwg network we be gather view to ensure that the perspective of victim and survivor remain central we must avoid delay as be see in the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and we be progress as swiftly as thoroughness allow misinformation undermine this process allegation of intentional delay lack of interest and widening or dilution of the inquiry scope be false the inquiry will remain laser focused on groom gang as baroness casey recommend this scandal arise because young mainly white girl be systematically gang rap and it be cover up by those in authority because the perpetrator be mainly of pakistani origin it be all the more shocking that when call for national inquiry become public in january the prime minister smear campaigner as jump on far right bandwagon comment like that be disgrace and be what lead to this scandal be cover up in the first place month later just two day before face vote in parliament the government finally agree to the inquiry but it be clear that they never want this inquiry and be force into it perhaps that be why month later the government have say nothing substantive publicly and their inquiry be descend into chaos what we have hear publicly be that victim and survivor on the liaison panel have no confidence in the government or the inquiry in the last hour alone two have resign fiona goddard resign from the panel say that the secretive conduct and condition impose on survivor by the government have lead to toxic fearful environment and there be high risk of people feel silence all over again hour later ellie ann reynolds also resign say that the remit of the inquiry have be widen to downplay the racial and religious motivation behind our abuse the minister shake her head but that be what ellie ann reynolds say fiona also raise the issue of sabah kaiser who have be act as liaison officer on behalf of nwg just two year ago ms kaiser describe call out the fact that the majority of perpetrator be of pakistani heritage as destructive distract irresponsible give those frankly appalling view and the complaint about they by survivor will the minister ensure that ms kaiser play no further role victim and survivor have also question the suitability of former police officer or social worker to chair the inquiry they do not believe that people from the profession that fail they so badly be suitable will the minister accept this feedback and appoint judge to lead the inquiry will the minister confirm that the scope of the inquiry will not be dilute as both fiona and ellie ann say be now happen and that it will focus on the cover up of the rape gang scandal because of the fact that the majority of perpetrator be of pakistani origin finally fiona say this yesterday just will be gag and control by the government while they turn this inquiry into cover up will the minister apologise to fiona and ellie ann the right hon gentleman can not have listen to my remark at all if he be suggest that the government have silence anybody the government have not handle the process it have be handle by grooming gang charity he cite and name victim of crime if the right hon gentleman have do anywhere near the level of work that have do he would know that not all victim and survivor be of the same opinion they be not one homogeneous group of people who all think the same thing who all want the same exposure and who all want their identity know have speak to fiona goddard many time and will continue that relationship with she should that be what she wish every single survivor who have be engage with there have be many will have different feeling on the subject with regard to the right hon gentleman require judge baroness casey say to the house in the home affairs committee that she do not want traditional judicial lead inquiry she be explicit about that can anyone in the house find an institution that do not fail these girl over the year that include our court which take child away from the grooming gang victim and which criminalise some of they there be no institution in our country that have not fail today will meet many of the victim and get their feedback and will continue to progress with that in mind will engage with all the victim regardless of their opinion and will listen to those who have be put in the medium and be put in panel will always listen and will speak to all of they oldham have step forward to take on local inquiry and it have be wait to understand what the move to the national inquiry mean for its work the same be true of victim and survivor whose bravery and strength in the most difficult circumstance have be truly remarkable what arrangement have be put in place to ensure that there be clear front door offer support that be fully independent of council and police force while local deep dive be clearly essential can we have an assurance that if the evidence take an investigation beyond council and police force boundary it will be follow to the full extent will not be chair the inquiry so can only say to my hon friend that the term of reference be not sure this be usual will be consult on in public that be because of the issue of bad faith and the concern about transparency the remit of the inquiry will be decide by the chair live within those term of reference have be part of various different inquiry or watch they from distance know that no stone will be leave unturned whoever chair the inquiry will feel empower to do what they think be good call the liberal democrat spokesperson it have be four month and long since the home office announce the national statutory inquiry into group base child sexual exploitation know that ministers will have want quick progress we on the liberal democrat benches do too we still have no chair no term of reference and most importantly no justice for the victim who have already wait year now two member of the victim and survivor liaison panel have step down after raise concern about shortlist chair they seem to have lose confidence in the process before it have begin the home office must listen to and act on the concern of victim know that the minister will agree and get the inquiry off the ground that be the only way to ensure that it proceed with integrity and the trust of those it be mean to serve now be the time to prioritise justice and prevention over political point scoring know that the minister will agree with on that too because this be an extremely sensitive matter particularly for the victim will the minister commit to publish the term of reference along with full detail of the inquiry budget and staffing and timeline by the end of the month if not to that deadline when will that be publish thank the hon gentleman for both his tone and his approach as per the inquiries act the term of reference have to be set and consult on with the chair the chair be be decide on have to say it be not take any long than the covid inquiry or the infected blood inquiry which think each take seven month from their announcement to the appointment of the chair do not remember huge amount of criticism or bellyache about that because we want to get those thing right actually get this right mean deal with lot of different stakeholder and victim with different view the process have to be follow that the term of reference go through the chair we have already do some of the work on the term of reference with victim group but we can not publish those we will do that publicly as say until chair be appoint will not rush that because will take note of all the feedback receive today the government have announce that they will take parental responsibility away where child be bear of rape that will protect grooming victim child in this country will no long be the only proceed of crime that criminal can have lifelong access to do the minister agree that survivor be fail for too long by conservative government who do not prioritise give they justice that party be lead by the leader of the opposition who do not mention groom when she have the power to do something about it instead survivor have have to wait for victim and activist to be on the government benches and for the fierce of advocate to be at the dispatch box thank my hon friend think she mischaracterise as the fierce of advocate because she as grooming victim with child bear of rape be the fiercest and brave could cry feel so proud that the government seek to get she elect have be campaign for the thing she have fight for with groom gang victim for nearly decade meet with ministers of the then government and nothing be do interruption the exact thing that she have campaign for be ask for repeatedly and nothing be do be incredibly proud of she as it be because of she and this government that today can say that that will change have copy of the government response to the development last night address to the home affairs committee and find the response completely unacceptable be the government seriously imply that fiona and ellie who have be disbelieve and call liar by the british state their entire life be spread misinformation about process they have be directly involve in that would be deeply damaging thing for any government to imply bad there be line in the letter about the government propose inquiry in oldham that say that the government have be in discussion with oldham council about the right approach for oldham how can that possibly be right how can the home office discuss the right approach with the very local authority be investigate it would be like the post office inquiry sit down with the post office to negotiate how it should be investigate will the minister explain how the government will restore trust right now in the process give the content of the letter that she send to the home affairs committee last night can be completely clear be suggest that will listen completely and utterly to the feedback from the victim who be on the panel and those who still be they be not spread misinformation at all but the hon member interpretation be brilliant case in point will be completely honest the conversation with oldham be do we not think it might be well for oldham just to take part in statutory inquiry it have absolutely nothing to do with the idea that oldham be tell what to do the more people on the conservative oh the hon member can hold up his letter and have smug face all he like but the fact of the matter be that there be no council in this country that will tell the inquiry where it can and can not go have say that million time from the dispatch box yet the same thing get peddle again and again know that the minister will not want to comment on individual candidate to chair the national groom inquiry however may put on record that jim gamble be highly regard police officer with long experience of deal with this matter his leadership of the child exploitation and online protection centre prove what fearless and fiercely independent figure he be with real track record of track down sick paedophile online and off do the minister agree that the chair of the inquiry must be someone who can earn the trust of those who have be let down by those in position of authority for far too long will she confirm hope that she will that the inquiry will not shy away from issue of race or class and will follow the evidence wherever it lead first and foremost absolutely confirm that that will not happen not only that but confirm that the home office have ask police force across the country to collect datum on ethnicity that be not do before will not be draw into his point about the chair it be not up to however will say that the gentleman my hon friend mention resign from previous role in this field because he think that the then government be not invest enough in tackle child sexual exploitation the victim of these crime be vulnerable child who be ignore gaslit and dismiss two victim have now resign because of the process its failure and their lack of faith in it yet hear what appear to to be an aggressive and defensive tone from the minister yes that be because of you lot she should remember that those people be watch will she listen to the victim and do she regret that those two individual have resign from the process absolutely regret that they have resign from the process funnily enough in the particular instance of one of the people have have no involvement in that process do not know who be on the panel of victim it be entirely independently manage by grooming gang charity one of my only intervention be to ensure that the name of some of the voice that think deserve to be hear be include have do that on number of occasion will of course listen to they actually be mean to be with those panel of victim hear their response right now as have say will take the feedback of anyone both publicly and should they want to speak to as have approach they be always sad when victim feel that they can not take part in process of course be there be many different victim and they have many different view there be one that we hear publicly but want to make it clear that there be many different victim and we have to ensure that all their voice be hear equally whether they be part of the process or not the minister have reiterate time and again that victim must be at the centre of an inquiry will she tell we what she intend to do to ensure that that aim be fully implement while the inquiry be ongoing that will be matter for the chair however know from the inquiry that have be involve in that be successful and victim centric that there always have to be system for support the victim both with take part in the inquiry and with the trauma that might be bring up usually those two thing be separate but will say this once again will not be the chair of this committee undoubtedly it be about ensure that victim be protect throughout the process should they want to go out and speak publicly both negatively and positively about that process would absolutely welcome that people should never be prevent from speak we have to ensure that support be available regardless of how they wish to gain it there should be nothing more precious in the eye of this parliament than the protection of child particularly those who suffer at the hand of these barbaric individual many of we be parent aunt uncle and grandparent and this cut very deep know that the minister care and be caring person but today we need decisive action give that one of the victim have walk away from the inquiry two give that two of the victim have walk away from the inquiry will the minister clearly state how she will ensure that fully independent inquiry can take place and that it prominently include victim all can say be that there be reason that can not stand in front of the victim who be mean to be get feedback from right now and definitely say when the chair will come could have just put my finger in the air and pick out some random judge we could have do that but be listen to victim feedback again have to stress that that process be not easy there be difficult dynamic within group of people and the people who we have ask to engage be deal with difficult thing so undoubtedly that be not uncomplex as anyone who have work with group of people who have be wrong sham and treat badly will know it would be lie to stand here and tell they that there be straight line and simple answer and be not willing to do that thank the minister for her continued work all victim and survivor have not have their voice hear for too long we need to ensure that that happen and be sure that the minister be do that will she confirm what resource be available to ensure that survivor be properly support through the process on system delay we know that there be still issue with court delay and ensure we go after all the perpetrator will she give an update on that and on the jay inquiry recommendation will chair an interministerial cross government group next week to push through the other recommendation baroness casey make recommendation but people rarely speak about any of the other this be not her most press one instead she give primacy to the policing relate recommendation around operation beaconport as say in my previous statement on september the work on the case that move forward be ongoing and run alongside this that be where justice will be serve in our court if only they have not be horrendously degrade so that rape victim wait for year and year think we all agree that the voice of survivor have to be at the heart of this it be worry and concern when two of those survivor do not feel as if the process be properly look after they and ensure their voice be hear will the minister commit to speak to both fiona goddard and ellie ann reynolds to try and encourage and reassure they that this be process that really will listen to their voice that opportunity have already be present to they and would be more than happy know one of they but not the other that opportunity be always available and one of they have my phone number on the idea that do not listen and have not be make myself available have try to keep the process fiercely independent of government intervention so that it can happen and victim can feel safe in that but of course feel sad that this be how it have end actually hope that this be not how it have end and will commit to make sure that this be not the end my door be always open to they in bangladeshi national be sentence in my carlisle constituency for attempt to recruit four girl age to into prostitution in his sum up the judge describe how the man conduct have corrode the foundation of decency and respect by which all right think people live their life whatever their ethnic or religious background will the minister take the opportunity to again reassure all right think people that this inquiry will look at everything to find answer include the role of ethnicity say again and again that it will not shy away from finding where they be present anybody who have do the work in this space will know that that be go to be find as the case in my hon friend constituency highlight there be absolutely no sense that ethnicity will be bury away every single time that there be an apparently needless delay even though it take seven month to put in place chair for both the covid inquiry and the blood inquiry and nobody moan about that it get use to say that we want to cover something up that be the misinformation be talk about it will not cover thing up we be take time to ensure that that can never happen the hon lady have be an outspoken champion for the victim and will continue to be so but she must be concern that two member of the panel have withdraw and we understand that one of the candidate to be chair of the inquiry have withdraw clearly there be concern across the house that institution such as the police social service council and the court be all in position where they have fail whoever chair the inquiry must therefore have full rigour over service that they may have be involve in so there be an issue of confidence can she update the house on how the inquiry will report back to the house and what scrutiny the house will have over the action of the inquiry and the term of reference thank the hon gentleman who be in unique category of always ask question that lead to further question that be pertinent an inquiry do not usually report to the house while it be ongoing but will take that away to see if there be an appetite for that all can say be that there be no institution in the country include this one here that do not have skeleton do think all politician would not be robust in this no do not think some would can guarantee that can point at people the hon gentleman include who would show absolute rigour even against his own the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse iicsa have judge lead it and it lose the confidence of the victim three people lose the confidence of the victim it take two year there be not an institution that do not fail those girl that be the whole point there be no clean skin but there be brilliant people who whistleblew and who try in every one of those institution that be essentially where we be leave with this but promise rigour in the same way that when see thing happen in here be rigorous commend the minister for her formidable personal leadership on this and be proud to sit on these benches alongside other formidable campaigner too the minister have reiterate that the inquiry must be trauma inform and know from speak to victim in my constituency just how vital it be that we be cognisant both of the initial trauma that they have experience and also of the retraumatise effect of go through the process of seek justice for themselves and other can the minister set out more about how she will ensure that this trauma inform approach be weave through the ongoing inquiry as the inquiry be set up as with previous inquiry with very vulnerable group of people such as iicsa thing will have to be put in place to ensure that people can freely give their evidence and that will have to be do in trauma inform way the twelfth of baroness casey recommendation be that all the recommendation should be fully fund by the government and this government have absolutely commit to that very much expect that when the chair be in place those conversation about exactly how that will look will begin the only thing do control suppose in any of this be that this government will pay for it the cover up continue we have prime minister who never want national inquiry we have minister who never want national inquiry and we have the labour back benchers who never want national inquiry do the minister agree that the victim of these horrific crime will never get the justice they deserve as long as we have labour government in charge it be quite impressive that the hon member say that after grooming victim have stand up and speak from these benches but have learn to expect it he talk about cover up maybe he be do it for click do not know and understand that he think he be do god work in fight this issue but the idea that it be easy to find chair or to find people who want to step forward and take part in this process give the level of bad faith and when the issue be mire in political point scoring of the type he have just do he should really question his own morality ellie reynolds have say that financial dependency have make people stay silent when they should speak and also allege that people on the panel be isolate by have contact with each other discourage the minister have be extremely clear that this be fully independent process and have not have government involvement but how do she propose to handle the very complex relationship between the concern that ellie reynolds have speak clearly about and ensure that the process retain the faith of everyone involve as have say would very much hope to hear those concern directly from ellie herself and to see what can be do only know the victim who have work with when they have be on the panel they have speak to because have personal relation with they and what can say be that there be differ view about the level of confidentiality the confidentiality be not to silence people or prevent they from speak about their own experience it be necessary because there be people in those room who have never show their face who be also victim have run an agency myself know about try to manage that can see why somebody might say that we should not seek out people outside the meeting because other might have say they do not want that but they be not go to say that in public can imagine all those thing be try to get across the idea of how complex these situation be but be more than happy to listen to ellie and see what have go wrong in the process for she and seek to make it well be absolutely happy to do that we have hear what the minister say about diverse view among victim but be she concerned that some survivor of these terrible crime have describe the process as toxic fearful environment and warn that there be high risk of people feel silence all over again what be she go to do to reverse that failure refer the hon member to my previous answer as have say number of time be go to speak to those involve and look into the process it be not process that have personally be part of and can only speak to the victim who happen to have know before if they tell that they be part of it not the other way around can not ask who be involve that be confidential by its very nature of course be go to listen to that feedback and like have say will speak to those victim involve victim must be at the heart of the grooming gang inquiry do the minister agree that get the right chair be absolutely key to ensure that that happen do she also agree that we have to avoid the scene that we see under the last government who appoint three chair who then withdraw from the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse an inquiry that take two year to start my hon friend who know have some experience of inquiry from her previous life be exactly right people do not remember it now but there be victim go out in the press complain about what be go on with iicsa it go through numerous chair there be already much bad faith in this instance both rightly and wrongly for to allow the same to happen during this inquiry would just make people shout cover up so we be try to do everything possible to ensure that the mistake make by the previous government be not make again the credibility of the national inquiry rest on place the voice experience and need of victim and survivor at its very centre can the minister show victim in wales how this inquiry will be guide by their good interest give that survivor have such grave concern that they feel they must resign from the panel to go back to the previous answer the chair of the inquiry will set the tone for the inquiry that be why we have to put in place the right chair and system for victim who want to take part in the inquiry that will care for and look after they and that be what we be work to achieve thank the minister for her response and absolutely agree that it be crucial to get this right so can she be absolutely clear that the inquiry will not be water down particularly in its focus on groom gang and ethnicity include on model of groom where groomer focus on the ethnicity of victim whether that be young white girl or even sikh girl absolutely absolutely pay tribute to the community response in my hon friend local area to recent incidence of very hideous sexual violence and put on record my love to the family and victim involve absolutely agree this be grooming gang inquiry and it will follow what baroness casey state as say in my statement it will be three year long it will not shy away and it will be grooming gang inquiry acknowledge the minister commitment to get to justice on this issue and recognise the frustration that she express because be responsible for the infected blood compensation scheme which involve meet diverse group of different charity and representative body that do not agree with one another however gently and respectfully say to she that we face credibility gap on this issue and urge she to examine how she can get ahead with the communication so that she can continue to demonstrate her commitment to get to justice frankly we as member of parliament have to come to this place when thing get into the medium and public concern be express understand her frustration but get the communication right and maintain pathway to the delivery of justice be critical do not disagree with the right hon gentleman most of what see report on anything in this space be largely inaccurate and often come with an agenda more so than in the case of the infected blood scheme although absolutely take my hat off to the job that he have to do there be balance between want to give complete and utter running commentary on very complicated thing and make sure that people feel like something be go on because nature abhor vacuum and so do misinformation the minister have hear implore she many time to move as speedily as possible to address the challenge of the victim of these awful crime but on this occasion implore she to take the right time to find the right judge it be not normal public appointment this be someone who have to command the confidence of the house the public and most importantly survivor they must leave no stone unturned and investigate everything whether that be ethnicity class related or institutional and make the minister life hard if they have to do so will the minister take the time to find the right judge and not repeat what we see with the child sexual abuse inquiry several year ago absolutely will and my hon friend give the opportunity to say that no matter who be pick there will be people unhappy with it like most politic that we deal with let we just call spade spade and stop pretend that there be perfect situation there be only the good situation we can have funnily enough in the conversation that have have with some of the prospective chair the main thing have want they to take away be the feeling that if they have to slag off all day long then that be exactly what they should do and would say the same to the victim the minister obviously feel very deeply about this issue think we all agree that anyone who be involve in these awful and horrific crime must be hold to account and we must shine light on anyone who turn blind eye and ensure that it do not happen again can the minister provide commitment that the inquiry will not be politicise particularly after multiple local authority have attempt to block investigation that be really important question because we see that happen everyone need to be investigate on this it do not matter which party they be from this be too important far be it from to speculate about where would like the inquiry to go but if have my way and be the chair would have grave concern about the area where live member will not be surprised to hear because that be where work the fact that it have labour council would not stop from want to look there in fact if the house will excuse my unparliamentary language could not give toss about order be sorry the minister feel she have to push it she be do an excellent job she do not need to push it she be well than that call alison hume thank the minister both for her statement and for the passion and rigour that she bring to her role even if sometimes she might say thing that she have to apologise for we greatly appreciate her dedication to the role actually grant the urgent question that be why we be here thank you mr speaker every survivor experience of abuse be unique do the minister agree that take the time to find the right chair will enable they to ensure that every story will be fully tell really hope so but be not go to do what other people seem to want to do in this circumstance and pretend that there be guarantee and that have some sort of magic weapon that be the process that be undertake be try to get the very good chair who be support alongside the victim who have be take part in the process get this right be both important and extremely difficult have two question for the minister if when she meet fiona and ellie ann she find that they be right and that there be something wrong what power do she have to intervene secondly will she provide assurance that the inquiry will not be staff she may be able to comment on her power and the power to influence by individual who previously dismiss the concern of survivor and campaigner as racist slur in answer to the first question have every power to intervene in the panel process but the decision make be that it should be independent of and my office and would be well handle by expert in the field when speak to those involve of course can raise thing and make decision about how this go forward very much hope that we will be draw to conclusion and that soon will have much less involvement to the right hon gentleman other question victim and survivor of this crime all have different political opinion they all have different view on the substantive they have different view about whether it should be call groom or whether it should be call group they have different view on all these thing will not stand here and say that would eliminate any victim or survivor work on this base on their political view and will continue to say that as it be many of they do not like very much imagine if just do not let the people who do not like very much have their voice hear well frankly would be guilty of cover up the minister have make it clear that woman and girl be fail by every institution and it be positive step that the failure have now be acknowledge by government and that the acknowledgment be lead to action after year of inaction but in scotland we have have absolutely no acknowledgment or action what advice would the minister give and other across scotland who be become increasingly angry that the scottish government be do all they can not just to block an investigation but to block any kind of independent scrutiny or case review of organise child exploitation first while the inquiry be in england and wales one of the victim who we have be hear about today ellie live very much in the borderland of our two great country of england and scotland there be absolutely no doubt in my mind that some of the thing that may get find in the inquiry will have finding across the border unfortunately the trafficking of young girl do not follow line on map as easily as we might think it do when we administer inquiry my hon friend should continue to work with survivor group up in scotland to push for what exactly it be that they want to see in scotland thank the minister for her answer know her heart be in this to get justice and do not think that there be any doubt about that however it be difficult to hear the news that these victim who have already be denigrate and treat as voiceless and worthless during their initial abuse have be make to feel that way once again in this inquiry and the minister will understand that it be also difficult for we to accept that this be take place on the government watch do she agree that the inquiry be not get this right will she instruct that immediate action be take to give those young woman their voice back to ensure that justice be serve and that safeguard be in place to prevent such abuse from take place on british soil ever again absolutely share the hon gentleman upset and frustration on the matter he know that when say that will do whatever can to ensure that these problem be sort out where they can be that be what we will seek to do and we will continue to try to do that what we have to do with this inquiry be not just look at what go wrong and hold people to account we have to ensure that it can not happen again say to opposition members that their relentless politicisation of the issue be no doubt make it much hard to find chair because it will be put candidate off as the inquiry get under way we must keep up progress on implement the recommendation of the jay iicsa inquiry raise concern on report during the crime and policing bill that the government proposal to implement mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse do not go quite as far as iicsa want and those concern be raise again in the other place last week by baroness grey thompson will the minister ask her colleague lord hanson to meet and baroness grey thompson to discuss how we can remedy that in way that work for everyone and that protect child the simple answer be yes my hon friend be absolutely right on his first point what we should all seek to be do throughout this be to try to grease the wheel so that we can have the good possible inquiry we should all be seek to do that while hold people to account with as much scrutiny as be need will absolutely do that and obviously have meet my hon friend number of time get mandatory reporting right be vital and much like in the survivor group there be different view on either side blackpool continue to live with the scar of charlene downes and paige chivers two young girl in blackpool who never come home and be subject to grooming will the minister confirm to my constituent that the grooming gang inquiry will be thorough and comprehensive and commit to full and transparent investigation ensure that every avenue be examine to uncover the truth absolutely will funnily enough this morning speak to one of my hon friend constituent grooming gang victim to assure she of similar thing quite lot of this process cause quite lot of nervousness and there be need to manage lot of different people emotion but absolutely make that commitment to he as make it to one of his constituent this morning and make it to the house point of order on point of order mr speaker may invite you to examine column from yesterday hansard during the exchange about maccabi tel aviv supporter travel to aston villa in reply to my question the secretary of state for culture media and sport say she agree with about the safety of everyone walk the street but she go on to say perhaps he might make that point to the people he now associate with on his left and right because that be not what we have hear from they in the last few week official report october vol there be suggestion in that that my colleague have do something other than say that everyone should be able to walk the street safely in our society they be concern about the danger from football supporter act in hooliganistic way at the aston villa game think the secretary of state should correct what she say order jeremy come on you have certainly put your view on the record but what we will not do be continue the debate you know that as long stand member of this house who have great respect will leave it at that because you have certainly ensure that we be all aware of that correction on point of order mr speaker follow the point make by my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen despite the safeguarding minister good effort to explain whether she be involve concern the response to the urgent question that you have grant mr speaker be genuinely more confused and think that many constituent will be too despite the minister say that she be not look to provide running commentary may ask that she update the house clearly to assist on these matter so that we can avoid urgent question such as this one call the minister far to that point of order mr speaker be not sure what the hon member be confused about victim panel be set up to look at both the term of reference and the appointment of chair there be variety of different group of people some of they have do both some of they have take part in just one or the other usually depend on time and logistic as she might imagine that have be manage by an organisation call nwg have not take part in those session other than to feedback on chair the feedback on the chair appointment come to do not have to go to that but go and sit and listen usually that be the first time know who have be on the panel when they have be interview chair the process be entirely manage because of my year of experience happen to know quite lot of the people and so do speak to some of the people who be on the panel because have personal relationship with they and have support they over the year hope that clear that up thank the minister for that cyber extortion and ransomware reporting motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require company that meet specified criterion to report any cyber extortion or ransomware attack on the company to the government within specified time after the attack to make provision about the content of such report include requirement to provide information about any payment make and for connected purpose this be timely and press matter illegal activity across the nation be on the rise and cyber attack be no exception the national cyber security centre have report increase in british cyber incident deem highly significant over the past year furthermore of the incident the ncsc be call upon to assist with at least half be consider of national importance among the significant threat identify in the ncsc annual review be hostile state such as china link to co ordinate campaign involve three china base company target foreign government and critical network and iran which the ncsc assess as highly likely threat to uk entity uk it leader be understandably alarmed research from armis have reveal that of uk it leader cite china and cite russia as their top cyber security concern if that be not enough recent espionage trial have throw harsh spotlight on the scale and intent of state sponsor cyber operation the threat be undeniable we must act with urgency to safeguard uk base company and critical infrastructure before these escalating menace begin to seriously disrupt the functioning of our nation under current legislation cyber attack need only be report in limited circumstance organisation handle personal datum must report cyber attack that pose likely risk to individual right essential service operator and relevant digital service provider must disclose incident with substantial service impact and few regulated body such as the financial conduct authority and the solicitors regulation authority follow their own cyber incident reporting requirement notably there be no requirement for company to disclose when ransomware payment have be make despite the significant financial burden such payment can impose cohesity global cyber resilience report find that of company target by ransomware choose to pay with an average cost of and some reach as high as million the reality be clear cyber crime particularly extortion and ransomware have outpace exist legislation it have allow dangerous gap to emerge in our intelligence gathering gap that criminal be likely to exploit and have weaken the defence of our national critical infrastructure against these escalate threat the cyber extortion and ransomware reporting bill seek to close those gap and reinforce the uk resilience against cyber crime follow australia implementation of mandatory ransomware payment reporting regime which have so far be successful it be imperative that the uk follow suit the bill would mandate any british company register under the companies act that have an annual turnover above million or be responsible for critical national infrastructure to inform the government within hour of become victim to cyber extortion or ransomware attack with further report be require if any payment be make by the company or third party on its behalf within hour of the transaction take place we have all witness the shocking headline about major british company under siege from cyber attack result in severe disruption and million in lose revenue from to the co op harrod to jaguar land rover these attack have be crippling and yet the government currently have no legal right to know whether ransom payment be make to restore their system what if that payment be make to terrorist organisation what if it be send to hostile state it be not the fault of the company who under immense pressure and with limited option choose to pay to regain control of their operation the fault lie in the gap in our legislation gap that allow ransom payment to go unreported potentially fuel even great threat against our nation the propose threshold of an annual turnover exceed million or those responsible for critical national infrastructure have be carefully consider it capture approximately of medium sized business and all large corporation while avoid the overwhelming influx of report that low threshold would trigger due to the high number of small and medium sized enterprise in the uk national critical infrastructure comprise all sector define by the government chemical civil nuclear communication defence emergency service energy finance food government health space transport and water these criterion capture the vast majority of company whose compromise through attack or ransom payment could pose serious risk to the uk it also reflect the volume of report our resource can realistically manage while establish clear accessible threshold so that company be not force to navigate complex policy during the stress of an active attack another imperative component of this approach be the inclusion of all payment type whether monetary intellectual property exchange of gift or service or other form of benefit this broad scope will enable law enforcement to trace criminal network identify pattern and disrupt the flow of illicit fund it will help to inform well resource allocation as well as hold the potential to foster collaboration across sector that would result in fast alert and strong resilience understand that many company may have reservation regard the requirement to report incident and ransom payment it could leave they vulnerable to reputational damage from potential leak damage their business far this proposal be pro business and that be why robust legal protection would be establish to ensure that any report make to the government remain strictly confidential with no right of publication unless it be deem to be in the national interest this will give company the assurance they need to report without fear and the support they deserve to help their recovery what happen if company fail to report within hour of cyber extortion attack or neglect to submit follow up report within hour of make ransom payment quite simply it will face civil monetary penalty mandate reporting be essential to our national security and collective wellbeing non compliance must be actively discourage it be in the company interest the public interest and the government interest the absence of mandatory reporting especially for ransom payment leave dangerous blind spot in our national security when company report these payment our security agency gain vital intelligence intelligence that help we to understand who be be target how attack be evolve and where our vulnerability lie before they be exploit espionage today be not confine to spy and steal document it be digital it be silent and it be relentless the grey zone exist cyber extortion and ransomware attack be fast become the preferred weapon of hostile actor seek to destabilise our institution and exploit our vulnerability their attack be become progressively more complex often leave company with no viable alternative but to make ransom payment from individual hacker to organise criminal gang and state back attack from overseas we can not afford to fall behind in the race of technological defence and expose ourselves to increasingly sophisticated cyber extortion attack while acknowledge that the government reference the introduction of cyber security bill in the king speech it be deeply concern that despite the urgency of the threat the bill have yet to even be bring before parliament cyber criminal be not slow down and their method be not become simple on the contrary attack be grow in complexity scale and impact although recognise that sound policy require time to develop we can not afford to proceed at our current glacial pace delay only deepen our vulnerability particularly in the light of recent event we must act decisively and without hesitation to safeguard british business and protect our national security the choice before we be stark either we allow ourselves to become increasingly expose as criminal outpace our outdated legislation and other nation fortify their defence or we rise to meet the moment with urgency resolve and the protection our country demand it be time for we to send an important message we will not allow cyber criminal to continue operate in the shadow unchecked and unchallenged question put and agree to order that bradley thomas tom tugendhat alison

history of poor compliance with court order new clause no presumption of suspend sentence no the presumption of suspend sentence will not apply if the offender be be sentence for three or more offence new clause no presumption of suspend sentence no the presumption of suspend sentence will not apply if the offender have already be convict of commit the same offence three or more time new clause expiry this act expire at the end of the period of year begin with the day on which it be pass schedule to stand part government new schedule sentence with fix licence period in scotland or northern ireland consequential provision government amendment oppose the whole idea of force court to give suspend sentence when they should be send offender to prison we all know that it be hard to get send to prison in the first place and judge and magistrate do not send people to prison lightly in fact they do not send people to prison enough as far as can see so it be extremely worrying that we be to force they to send even few people to prison my amendment seek to address this issue we can not make silk purse out of sow ear so it will not be possible to transform this disastrous bill into good one all we can seek to do today be make it less bad hon member should be under no illusion the bill take sledgehammer to our justice system and will dismantle law and order in this country to call the bill sentencing bill make mockery of we all it should be call the avoid sentence bill because it be slap in the face to victim and will embolden offender who will quite literally be laugh all the way to their next crime let put on record my support for amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle dr mullan and the hon member for clacton nigel farage particularly in relation to the abolition of the sentencing council and the deportation of foreign criminal but because of time constraint will speak only to those amendment table in my name the right hon lady suggest that the bill will bring law and order into question but as former prison officer would say it be the previous government run our prison system to boiling point that nearly bring law and order crash down with few than bed space available last summer it might be poignant for conservative members to reflect little during the debate on what they do to his majesty prison service while they be in office and while be serve thank the hon lady for make that point although would point out that under the last government three prison be build hmp five wells hmp fosse way and hmp millsike which add an extra place three further prison will also be build the active management of the prison service at those level of occupation be of course hard work but that hard work be absolutely necessary and far preferable to simply take view that we will not have all those criminal in prison at all the reality be that what we be do now be much bad agree with my right hon friend this disgrace of bill will not be send people to prison and at the same time it will be let people out of prison amendment and would change the length of sentence that qualify for the get out of jail free suspend sentence to those of less than month and only before any credit be give for guilty plea sentence of month or more be obviously give for more serious offence as the bill stand understand that those for whom sentence of month would be appropriate could hit the jackpot because the credit of guilty plea will be take into account that will reduce the sentence to month therefore those people will qualify for suspend sentence under this bill sentence of those length be not give for nothing so hope the government will reflect on my amendment which would reduce the maximum sentence that have to be suspend do quick scan of my local paper to see who have get an month sentence which could now become suspend sentence they include lady who cause the unnecessary suffering of an animal and be in possession of samurai sword and lady who glass pregnant friend in the face another sentence be for coercive and control behaviour and that person also get five year restraining order they could now all get suspend sentence the bill currently state that the presumption in favour of suspend sentence need not apply if the court be of the opinion that make the order would put particular individual at significant risk of physical or psychological harm amendment and would extend that to include the public who be after all collection of individual they too deserve protect if the court be concern that an offender be likely to be danger to the public it should absolutely have the right to ensure that that offender go to prison not back into the community on suspend sentence amendment and would change the risk level for not impose an immediate custodial sentence by remove the word significant would have think that any identifiable risk should be cover we be talk about protect people live we should not be play game of russian roulette with they ironically it seem that the sentencing council have see thing similarly as it have previously list this as reason not reason to suspend sentence amendment and would mean that anyone not be send to prison as result of this change who otherwise would have be would have to be give the maximum length of suspend sentence in other word the sentence would hang over they for the long possible time and they should not be give short period as could be the case with normal suspend prison sentence new clause would ensure that those give the suspend sentence be electronically tag throughout use tag to monitor someone location out of prison could make they think twice about reoffende and if they be to reoffend it could make detection and resentence much easy other amendment concern the type of offend that we be allow to be include in this ridiculous prison avoidance legislation so many offence will be cover by this exemption that be hard to know where to start this have to be address and sincerely hope that the government will accept my amendment most people will believe that we have completely lose the plot if we allow there to be some offence for which prison sentence can not generally be hand down new clause would exclude knife crime from be one of those offence can not believe that have to table an amendment to prevent whole load of criminal who carry knife from be keep out of prison yet without my amendment that be what this bill will do do no one anywhere think through what be be propose and how it will affect public safety it would be completely disgraceful for the government ever to claim to be serious about tackle knife crime when under the bill the presumption will be that many people carry knife will no long be send to prison how will that help to prevent the loss of life on our street be grateful to my right hon friend for make that point because many of we will have example in our constituency of family who have be tragically affect by knife crime some go on to do amazing work to educate young people but at the same time it be important that where sentence have be give it be carry out and that that deterrent be in place yet again we be see the removal of deterrent by the labour government my right hon friend be absolutely right that this bill remove deterrent repeat knife offender be suppose to get mandatory immediate custodial sentence of six month minimum not guarantee effectively that they will evade prison because their sentence be month or less why would anyone think twice about carry knife if they know that they will not see the inside of cell and that the court will be powerless to send they to prison understand and appreciate the effect of knife crime we have all have case in our constituency that demonstrate the devastation that it cause do the right hon member agree that we should focus on rehabilitation and on prevent people from carry knife education on this issue be important it be the way forward in ensure that knife crime be decrease rehabilitation be key but so be prison prison for people who have commit crime be essential prison be about remove danger from society we hear lot about rehabilitation from labour members and we hear lot about recidivism the most likely spur for recidivism be let people out who will continue to do harm we will be tell by the government that those people be be let out on licence so will my right hon friend invite the minister to predict how many people will be recall while they be on licence the justice secretary have already describe that number as be too high but will it rise as result of these measure my right hon friend make his point clear the minister be listen and hope that he will answer that question in his remark people can not seriously think it be acceptable for those who commit offence involve firearm or ammunition or even those who commit terror relate offence to be eligible for suspend sentence but as thing stand those offence would be cover by the bill my new clause and would amend that ludicrous position and new clause would exclude burglar we do not see nearly enough burglar in court because of lack of detection of their crime so the one we do see in court should routinely go to prison not be spar jail as they would be under these measure new clause and would mean that those assault our dedicated police officer or emergency worker would not be eligible for suspend sentence they be eligible for they under this bill and that be an absolute disgrace when the government be in opposition they make huge noise about how those who assault emergency worker police officer and prison officer should be send to prison for example the hon member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant introduce private member bill that become the assault on emergency workers offences act under which the maximum prison sentence for assault on an emergency worker be increase from six month to year part of the problem be that all too often people do not feel that there will be justice at the end of the process when in opposition the right hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh say the attitude sadly exist across the criminal justice system that be punch or kick be somehow to be expect and accept we will never accept that people should be assault while they be do their job and we will do everything in our power to protect they official report october vol the hon member for bedford mohammad yasin say we must put legislation in place to guarantee that tough line will be take on anyone who assault an emergency worker official report april vol that be what government members say when they be in opposition but they be ensure the exact opposite now these offender will be let out on suspend sentence can not believe that government members would not join in vote for new clause would like to test the will and the temperature of the house on that matter and will not back down on that the presumption in the bill against immediate custody will also apply to those commit host of other nasty violent and sexual crime all of whom will be eligible for these get out of jail free suspend sentence if they be sentence to month or less for their crime new clause would mean that offence with mandatory minimum sentence would not be include in the bill that would alleviate the damage in some case new clause would exclude from mandatory suspension sentence that can be appeal for be unduly lenient the unduly lenient sentence scheme cover sexual offence stalk put someone in fear of violence serious harm or distress control or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship and inflict grievous bodily harm or unlawful wounding among other offence it would be nonsense for crime include among the most serious under the scheme to be deal with by way of suspend sentence instead of immediate custody how would the measure in the bill work on appeal would all sentence be overturn as be unduly lenient or would the new law trump that scheme my new clause would inject bit of common sense and avoid all these question my other amendment mainly concern the past of the offender it be bad enough that first time offender who have commit serious crime will avoid prison but it be outrageous that under the bill serial offender will be reward for reoffende new clause would mean that any offender who have commit three or more offence in the precede month would not be eligible for mandatory suspend sentence and new clause would stop they from qualify if they have commit or more offence previously people be commit multiple offence yet the government be let they off with suspend sentence eighty per cent of offender be reoffender because of the year of mess that this government be have to clear up the real travesty of justice be that there be no prison cell available for people who be convict the last government fail to build the prison place that be need this government will ensure that they exist because they will always be need it be as though the conservatives leave the tap run and be whine about the flood that they let happen be glad that the hon lady raise that point when be bring back into the cabinet office people in the left lean civil service in the ministry of justice say let let people out of prison it run too hot thankfully stand firm and say no and so do the conservative government unlike this government who have let thousand of people out of prison and be destine to do so again be afraid that this be ideological labour member do not think that more people should go to prison they think that those people should be in the community that be ideological and certainly not logical it do not support law and order in this country and it be slap in the face for victim on that point will the right hon lady give way will not new clause and would mean that offender would not be eligible for mandatory suspend sentence if they have previously be give suspend sentence or an immediate prison sentence for the same offence if an offender commit burglary now and go to prison for it and be convict of commit another burglary after the measure in the bill come into force it would be ludicrous if instead of be give long prison sentence most people would think that be fair they be give suspend sentence however the court would not have any other choice in many circumstance new clause would exclude criminal who have previously breach suspend sentence on three or more occasion from qualify for suspend sentence it could be argue that those who have breach suspend sentence once should not qualify completely agree but have decide that it should be three strike and you out people can not keep commit offence and keep get suspend sentence another strong case for three strike and you out be cover by new clause which cover offender who be convict of commit the same crime three or more time someone who commit the same crime three or more time will now get only suspend sentence these people should be get appropriate prison sentence not guarantee of no prison sentence at all new clause list poor compliance with court order as reason not to suspend sentence if court can see that criminal have not comply in the past with non custodial alternative and be therefore highly likely to breach suspend sentence it should have the option of impose immediate custody on the offender in fact that be already what current and past sentencing guideline say about consider an optional suspend sentence never mind mandatory one which criminal will have if this bill be bring into being under new clause offender be sentence in court for three or more offence at once could not expect presumption in favour of suspend sentence all the example have give come from judge and lawyer these be not possibility or scenario that have dream up they be happen now these people should go to prison and they would have do but the government be let everybody out that be why say that we will be dismantle law and order in this country if this bill go through there be nothing to stop magistrate and judge hand out suspend sentence if they think that they be appropriate but these amendment would not force they to hand they out when they be clearly not appropriate that be what the government be do they be tie the hand of the justice system the government have already make amendment to early legislation after presumably realise that they have miss something hope that on reflection and have hear about some of the disaster that be about to befall the country as result of this legislation they will do likewise today my new clause be very similar to government amendment and for example which will exclude those who be already subject to suspend sentence they have see one loophole but the bill be like colander of loophole and hope that they will see few more the government have not ensure that the bill will not apply to those on licence my new clause say that those who have be release early from prison on licence should not be eligible for presumption in favour of suspend prison sentence if they offend again really they should be lock up what the right hon lady be put forward be very logical and sensible way forward but be conscious that young people in particular can do something wrong in life and then return to the area that they come from they be subject to peer pressure and can be affect by all the thing that happen in that community sometimes they probably need help from outside the legal system have she consider that when put forward her amendment do they ensure that people get second chance and get help where they need it in the place where they live we all believe in second chance and that be where rehabilitation come into play we be possibly deal with continual offending here people have come before the court be give some kind of community sentence or be subject to tagging and still repeat their crime we do not want they to think that there be absolutely no deterrent and that they can commit crime as often as they want because they will get only tiny slap on the wrist people need to understand that their action be unacceptable there be victim and price to pay some people will understand go on the straight and narrow and go on to have good life but not as result of what be be deliver today the bill say commit crime and you will not do any time that be wrong wrong wrong it be the wrong message to send out that really should not need say but it seem that it do how on earth can it be right that someone who have be release early from prison will get second get out of jail free card that will happen under this ludicrous legislation under new clause the presumption against prison would not apply to foreign national if people come to this country and commit crime serious enough to warrant custodial sentence they should not be leave wander around our street freely as result of this bill foreign offender should be deport as protect the public be one of the main duty of government will have to repeat that several time to the government who do not seem to understand that that be major part of their duty and in the meantime those offender should be lock up while we have to put up with our own british criminal do not see why we should be lenient to those who have come to this country and commit offence do not think the public will agree with the government bill either urge all my colleague in the house of commons to think long and hard about the likely consequence of this bill and the needless victim of crime it will inevitably create anyone who allow the bill to go through without amendment to protect the public will effectively have blood on their hand as soon as someone be injure or kill by criminal who should have be in prison but be not as direct result of this terrible new legislation if the bill go ahead we should add my new clause which would insert sunset clause so that in two year time when we see what catastrophic mess this bill and this government have create we will all be glad that an end to it be in sight the importance of the sunset clause be that it relieve the monstrous contradiction we have have from the government they have present this legislation as an emergency measure because the prison be too full yet at the same time they boast about their great expansive prison build programme clearly the two be at odd with one another who will be put in these prison if this legislation persist that be why my right hon friend sunset clause be so important my right hon friend be exactly right that be why point out that the bill be all about ideology it be not about logic mention the extra prison that be start in when the previous government give billion to expand prison capacity and three of those prison have be build there be delay and it be obviously slow we be in lockdown for two year which be why they be come on board now but another three prison will be build if people be really serious about clean up our street get crime down and support victim they will not vote for this bill prison place be either here or on their way the prisons minister have say he think that only third of prisoner should be in prison and that two third of they should be out on the street that be why say that this bill be about ideology over logic and over the public as do at the start of my speech on second reading put on record the continue crisis in our prison the prison population currently stand at with usable operational capacity be prison population projection estimate that the population could rise to more than by march that be an indictment of the previous government and it give the lie to their mantra that this bill be soft on crime we will have record number of people in prison this bill be necessity and we must make virtue of that necessity welcome the principle of the bill and the reform suggest in it they be essential both to reduce the prison population and to improve the way in which the justice system deal with punishment rehabilitation and public safety the measure in the bill that derive from david gauke independent sentencing review include vary suspend sentence and short custodial sentence adopt the earn progression model for release and change to recall and licence all have their risk so the purpose of the amendment that and other member of the justice committee have table to which now turn be to reduce those risk and make practical improvement to the bill have also table two new clause relate to imprisonment for public protection prisoner who be not currently consider by the bill in my view wrongly the first amendment have table be amendment to clause which relate to income reduction order or iro these will act as financial penalty for offender who will forfeit percentage of their disposable income as form of punishment and reparation my amendment would change the definition of monthly income for the purpose of an iro so that any amount of money that be require to be pay or deduct from an offender monthly income because of other enactment such as child support maintenance payment or an attachment of earning order be not count this will ensure that iro do not impact on an offender ability to pay outstanding debt or in the case of child support maintenance to meet their obligation to support their child and family member in the community my second set of amendment relate to clause which introduce statutory requirement for court to make formal finding of domestic abuse where relevant during sentencing my amendment and introduce two procedural safeguard before court can record that an offence involve domestic abuse first the court must have indicate that it appear that the offence may have involve domestic abuse secondly the court must have give the offender and the prosecutor an opportunity to adduce evidence and make representation before come to the view that an offence involve domestic abuse the chair of the select committee be talk about indication of domestic abuse do he agree that particularly in case of domestic abuse as have hear from constituent of mine it be critical that resource be allocate through this bill to the probation service and for electronic tagging the legislation allow for it but do he agree that it be very important that the government make clear how they will adequately resource those two element so that victim of domestic abuse who will have this indicator to identify that perpetrator have commit domestic abuse and violence will be properly protect after the potential release of the perpetrator do agree with that and in moment will talk about new clause that deal specifically with tagging be rattle through my speech because have lot to get through but what be specifically talk about in relation to domestic abuse be simply the need for there to be due process that be something that think we all want to see amendment and would ensure that the requirement of clause which be important in allow police and probation service to track perpetrator of domestic abuse be carry out in manner that be as thorough and fair as possible my next amendment amendment relate to clause which amend the sentencing code to allow for the publication of the photograph and name of offender serve community sentence the explanatory note say very little about this clause but the justification in the memorandum on human right suggest that the government believe that this measure will have deterrent effect on criminal although there be little evidence for that assertion the measure engage the article right to private and family life for the individual their victim and their family some concern have be raise about how this measure can be operate safety in the modern social medium age in which photograph and name can be readily and quickly share my amendment would prevent clause from be bring into force until the secretary of state have issue code of practice to provider of probation service about how to take and publish photograph lawfully in the light of the human rights act and datum protection legislation before issue code of practice the secretary of state must consult provider of probation service lie draft before parliament and obtain the approval of both houses that would ensure proper parliamentary oversight of this measure the hon gentleman be indicate his diligence as though any evidence of that be require in table these technical but important amendment however will he deal with the fundamental issue as he have just say the criminal justice act from memory section allow criminal who be release on licence to be subject to all kind of condition but the truth be that if we let more dangerous people out more people will be recall because they will do immense amount of harm recall be go to go up as result of this legislation and many more people be go to suffer because of those who be let out early have quite lot to say about recall which will come to in moment but have reflect on this question licence be an established part of the criminal justice system as indeed be probation almost every prisoner other than handful of the most serious criminal come out of prison at some stage the issue of public safety when people be release from prison be one that this bill be try to address we may disagree on the mean to that objective but be sure we agree on the objective itself also table new clause which relate to the provision of information to parliament regard offender who be subject to electronic tagging and the operation of the tagging contract the success of the measure in this bill will rely heavily on the use of electronic monitoring primarily through the use of tag the justice committee have continually raise concern about the performance of serco the government current tagging provider as reminder on may the prisons minister reveal to we that at that point serco have receive financial penalty for poor performance every month since it take on the electronic monitoring contract on may minister have assure we that serco performance be begin to improve new clause would require the secretary of state to prepare and publish report each calendar year on the use of electronic monitoring requirement that report must include the number of electronic monitoring requirement impose each year the rate of compliance and the cost of administer those requirement each year the report must be lay before parliament this would improve transparency and allow parliamentarian to assess for themselves how successfully serco or other provider be administer tagging contract thank the chair of the select committee for give way new clause make the point that the cost of administer the electronic monitoring requirement during the year should be release do he agree that that should include the size of the fine that be impose on the provider when have ask the ministry of justice for that information it have not be able to release it think it be matter of public interest to know what the fine for the provider failure be be delighted that my friend be still take strong interest in these matter and remain on the justice committee even though he no long have his front bench responsibility we know that he have other responsibility that he wish to take on entirely agree with he it be point that we have make in committee and hope the minister have listen to it be sure that the word commercial confidentiality be use at some point but this be not about commercial confidentiality it be about we know how well electronic tagging be work which be very serious matter in the criminal justice system that be very well illustrate by the level of fine impose have table two new clause new clause and regard prisoner who be subject to imprisonment for public protection sentence it have be year since the last ipp sentence be hand down yet around people be still serve ipp sentence in prison it be now widely acknowledge that the nature of those sentence have severe consequence for those who be serve they and for their love one new clause would implement the recommendation of the previous justice committee report that there should be resentencing exercise for all ipp sentence individual and that time limit expert committee that include member of the judiciary should be establish to advise on the practical implementation of such an exercise thank the chair of the select committee for give way and for speak to his new clause it contain similar wording to the new clause table by the liberal democrats which ms nokes have indicate we may get separate vote on do that mean that the chair of the select committee will be vote with the liberal democrats and encourage his back bench colleague to do the same it mean that will listen very carefully not only to what the hon member say but to what the government say know that the government be unlikely to accept new clause because they have make their position on resentence clear nevertheless want to set out that that be the good option but be just about to talk about other option which might be more practical and which urge on the minister today the justice committee remain of the view that resentence exercise be the good and most comprehensive way to reduce the number of ipp prisoner in prison know however that the government be yet to be persuade of the merit of resentence on the balance of risk have also table new clause which would allow prisoner whose licence have not be terminate by the parole board two or three year after their first release to make an annual application for termination to the parole board this would increase the opportunity for the licence of ipp prisoner to be terminate and would reduce the amount of time those prisoner have to wait in limbo between parole board hearing in contrast to resentence this more modest amendment would enhance the process for ipp licence termination ipp termination have be the single most effective measure in permanently reduce the stain of the ipp sentence some of ipp sentence have be terminate by the parole board end the shadow of the sentence by cancel it and remove the risk of recall for those who have be deem safe by the parole board or comply with their licence for two year the new clause would build on the success of that process by reintroduce the right to apply for annual review that be remove by the victims and prisoners act at present if person ipp licence be not terminate when the parole board first consider it or if they have already have an unsuccessful review at the point when the act come into force the only option for end the licence be when it automatically expire after two year in the community without any recall equally the one off nature of the current termination process mean that victim be deprive of the opportunity to make representation between an initial decision not to terminate and an automatic termination they be simply informed that the licence have expire automatically once continuous two year period have be achieve this technical amendment would have significant effect and would in many respect put the law back to how it be previously hope the minister will look at that and respond when he reply to the debate have also table an amendment and new clause relate to recall and further release amendment to clause would give effect to recommendation of the independent sentencing review about strict criterion and threshold for recall the bill as draft do not deal with that aspect of the recommendation fix term day recall be akin to multiple short sentence which have be acknowledge as ineffective and disruptive to long term rehabilitation the amendment would put into statute the requirement for recall to be use only where there be evidence of consistent non compliance or specific and imminent risk of harm as recommend by the review new clause provide an opportunity for the current legislation for recall to be review prior to the new legislation be roll out to ensure that it be effective and adequately protect the public on another form of recall do the hon member have any sympathy with new clause table by my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey and the idea that there should be sunset on this provision however we look at the content of this bill it be bit of an experiment so we should make sure that two year on we examine it and if the circumstance require renew it we have to do something about recall and do it now the number of prisoner on recall have more than double over the seven year period from march to it be then and it be now that be significant part of the prison population rise be not go to give way again because be take too much time agree with the right hon gentleman that this be difficult process to manage that be why this bill be present on the same day that fix term recall come into operation ftr be the recent provision mandate fix term recall of day in determinate case of less than month the new day recall model recommend in the bill replicate ftr with the exception that the default recall period be extend from to day prior to this new provision be lay there have be no opportunity for the efficacy and impact of this model to be evaluate new clause would allow that evaluation to take place think be try to do the same as what he be say which be to ensure we look carefully and evaluate the effect we be into new territory here and there may be unintended consequence the sentencing review receive numerous report that offender be recall for breach such as their tag run out of power or failure to keep in touch and that breach and recall process be overly punitive and often feel to be unfair as the bill stand the legal test for recall remain unchanged as more offender will be release at an early date and the use of electronic tagging will increase there be great risk that people may be recall when there be minor problem with the tag or housing issue tighten the legal test for recall would confine their use to instance where there be evidence of consistent non compliance or specific and imminent risk of harm as recommend by the review without amendment there be real risk that the prison capacity crisis will not be adequately address and we could even see an increase in recall albeit for short period tight test would guard against unintended consequence from the overuse of day recall amendment to clause introduce the right for those be make subject to licence condition to make representation as to their necessity and proportionality that could be an important safeguard give the suite of new condition in the bill that enable wide range of restriction to be impose in the community without safeguard the use of these condition could lead to increase recall and increase pressure on the probation and prison system give offender an entitlement to make representation about licensing condition would assist in alert the authority to any unintended consequence such as where condition might impact on resettlement or other outcome include access to employment or healthcare be come towards the end but not just yet the last of my amendment be amendment to clause which concern restriction zone amendment would introduce requirement for the parole board to have oversight of new restriction zone for offender on licence restriction zone be by its nature highly restrictive and could impact on almost every aspect of an offender life include their ability to work receive medical care and see family any application to leave the zone place an administrative burden on the authority the amendment would introduce judicial oversight by the parole board of the extension of restriction zone that oversight could act as an important safeguard before such restriction be impose and may also provide an opportunity for victim to have voice in set out the potential impact on they before an independent body this be the first time that provision have be make to restrict offender to certain geographical area when release on licence without requirement for judicial oversight or due process the propose restriction be akin to control order now replace with terrorist prevention and investigation measure but without the requirement for gateway offence or judicial oversight finally have put my name to amendment table by my hon friend the member for colchester pam cox it would provide an important clarification of the power of the court to impose community sentence as an alternative to suspend prison sentence in circumstance where that may offer more effective prospect of avoid future offending or breach of licence condition it would likely be especially beneficial in keep woman out of prison to conclude repeat my support for the bill and the government approach to sentencing which be the big change in year thank the organisation work with ipp prisoner many of whom be relative and friend of those incarcerate include united group for reform of ipp and the ipp committee in action also thank the justice union parliamentary group the prison reform trust the law society and justice among other for their briefing and assistance with propose change to the bill hope the minister will consider the amendment that we have table as way to improve the bill content and bring clarity where it be need hope that he will respond to they in wind up and may even agree to adopt some of they we survive on hope call the shadow minister rise to speak in support of amendment and the other amendment that have table on behalf of the opposition regret that we have not have the opportunity to hear from important voice on these incredibly important issue through full public bill committee victim group of all different kind care deeply about the measure in this bill we not only do not get to hear from they as mps but the nature of committee of the whole house mean that we do not have the opportunity to put forward for inclusion whole range of measure that be worthy of our consideration and vote in support anyone read the amendment paper will see the richness and range of idea that just will not get the level of detailed consideration they should it would have be beneficial and we may well end up give this incredibly important bill less than hour of consideration in this house can not help but feel that the measure relate to early release be so unpalatable that the government be do their absolute good to rush this bill through the house to avoid proper scrutiny will try though to at least give some time and think to some of the amendment even if ultimately we will not be able to vote on they new clause relate to change to the unduly lenient sentence scheme at present the uls scheme allow anyone to appeal most sentence to the attorney general office if they consider they to be unduly lenient and other member of this house have make use of this scheme as have other it can and do lead to sentence be change but there be two major problem with the scheme as it operate first too many victim be unaware of the scheme and do not get long enough to make use of it at this point pay tribute to the amazing campaigner who have do so much to raise this issue katie brett secure thousand of signature to petition to change the scheme in memory of her sister sasha pay tribute to ayse hussein and other member of the justice for victims group the issue have also be raise for many year by tracey hanson who have the pleasure of meeting recently in memory of her son josh hanson who be the victim of an appalling murder know that other campaigner be similarly inclined all of they be clear about the fact that the current scheme do not work our amendment will require the crown prosecution service to notify victim and also extend the time available to appeal to up to year for victim and their family if the victim be deceased pay tribute to that campaign and in particular to my hon friend commitment to victim which know be outstanding will he acknowledge too that many of the people who suffer be suffer at the hand of repeat criminal career criminal sometimes people who have be let out on licence breach the licence condition for instance in my constituency young woman be kill by dangerous driver on licence who have be ban from drive there be many like she and my hon friend be stand for they will he therefore impress on the government that they be let out people who cause grief harm and hurt that be just not good enough as my right hon friend say we can do what we want when it come to place condition on people and expect they to behave differently but the only place where we can be sure they be not out commit further offence be prison across the board this measure will let very many serious offender out of prison early and shall say more about that towards the end of my speech in respect of the undue lenient sentence scheme the government have previously say that they will await the outcome of review of criminal appeal review that have already say that the system be work fine and for the implementation of whose recommendation we have no timetable or plan the opportunity to make that change be here and urge ministers to take it new clause relate to what be clearly unacceptable restriction on what people can say in victim personal statement often describe as impact statement this be further issue that the justice for victims group and other have raise the parent of sarah everard susan and jeremy have make it very clear that the people advise they on their statement be do their good to act in their good interest and to help secure the good possible outcome for justice for sarah but the system and the rule around this be lead to too many people like susan and jeremy be tell that they can not say what they should be allow to say glenn and becky youens also from justice for victims have the same experience when make statement about their feeling towards the vile criminal who have kill their precious daughter violet grace our new clause will ensure that the government can help victim to secure the good possible opportunity to say what it be that they want to say while recognise that the statement be still be make in court new clause be intend to close loophole that think all member agree need to be close our current sentencing law require whole life order to be pass for those who murder police or prison officer in the line of duty that be an important deterrent and enable the delivery of justice for people who put themselves in harm way deal with violent criminal should the bad happen however it be clear to that the court have not interpret the meaning of that legislation as and think most other member would have want they to in former prison officer lenny scott be murder he be murder by seriously violent criminal for do his job as prison officer lenny have bravely stand up to threat from this criminal while he supervise he in prison as he have report that he have contraband year later this despicable person come back for his revenge he be convict of lenny murder but the court decide that the whole life order tariff do not apply because he have not be actively on duty when the murder take place think that be counter to the spirit of the measure our new clause would remove the loophole so that in future if prison or police officer be murder because of something they do in their role whenever that might be the sentence will be whole life order imagine that of all the measure we be propose that will secure the great amount of cross party support not at this stage of the bill but during future stage in the lords new clause support great transparency in our justice system by ensure that sentencing remark in the crown court be available to everyone and transparency be also at the heart of new clause for too long for the wrong reason we have not be transparent about criminal background we know that political correctness lead to the vile groom gang scandal go unchallenged which should never have be allow for many decade part of the issue be that we do not have the datum and the information that would have enable we to understand what be happen and who be commit those offence why should we not have basic information about criminal that would enable we to have an honest debate about different pattern of criminal behaviour in different community and different part of the country especially when we know that if we refuse to do this if we refuse to be transparent all that we do be give fuel to the wrong people at good indifference to the need to share this data be look more and more like desire to cover up what it might reveal that have to stop and our new clause will ensure that it do new clause relate to step that the court should take to limit parental responsibility for those convict of child sex offence in the last parliament my hon friend the member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti campaign on this in support of constituent who meet ministers in that government to discuss it in the current parliament the hon member for lowestoft jess asato have join the campaign along with other member understand that yesterday the government table an amendment to the relate victims and courts bill which be due for further consideration and of course we will look closely at that to consider whether it meet the reasonable expectation of parent seek to protect their child from child sex offender new clause and also relate to child sex offender as have say will go on to talk about the wide plan to release offender early but when the government first announce those plan they make an obvious attempt to distract the medium from their actual plan by give the impression that they would introduce the mandatory chemical castration of sex offender what they have actually pledge to do be nothing of the sort we intend to deliver where they have not we want to ensure that when appropriate court can impose this and make sure that there be consequence for offender who do not comply the government have pretend to do whatever be necessary to help reduce the risk pose by child sex offender but we actually will new clause relate to our broad intention to reform the accountability of our justice system we will begin by restore accountability for the provision of sentence guideline we see that the sentencing council be intent on introduce two tier sentencing guideline and resist all attempt to prevent they from do that too many organisation have become disconnected from public accountability they think that simply put something on website or hold focus group mean that they understand what the public want and be accountable to they that be not accountability and in the come year we will set out programme of reform to ensure that while the judicial establishment retain its independence when it be vital to its successful operation it be not sit in an ivory tower separate from accountability to the wide public whom it serve let say to reform members that this new clause be good illustration of the fact that it be not enough just to be unhappy with the status quo we need proper plan to address it their new clause would abolish the sentencing council but provide for nothing to replace its function if we can not issue sentence guideline victim have no realistic basis against which to challenge short sentence new offence could be introduce without any way for the court to understand the expectation in respect of sentence support the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey relate to suspend sentence think that she do an excellent job in lay out the deep deep flaw in the government plan which agree be be drive by ideology and belief rather than reality think that her amendment in themselves demonstrate the number of way in which these measure be not sufficiently robust contain so many gap and loophole that those amendment seek to address let we be clear the court already do everything that they possibly can to avoid custodial sentence they be require by law to set the minimum sentence possible that still meet the interest of justice there be often confusion about what be describe as the impact of short sentence association be not cause but many people it seem do not understand that short sentence be frequently impose on recurrent prolific offender for whom community measure have be try and have not work by definition they be challenging cohort compare their reoffende rate with the reoffende rate for offender receive community sentence be very misleading when we do the more detailed work of compare like for like in term of offend history and other characteristic we see that the difference in reoffende rate fall back dramatically to single figure offender receive short sentence deserve to receive they very many of they be individual who assault emergency service worker as be highlight powerfully by my right hon friend the member for tatton when in opposition labour members say that that be intolerable and that deal with it be priority why should such offender escape punishment in prison be pleased that my right hon friend have draw specific attention to that with her amendment and her speech my hon friend be now come to the nub of the issue there be different view across the house there be those of we who believe that the justice system should be retributive that punishment matter and that punishment should fit crime and there be those who do not there be those who do not think that the justice system should be punitive whereas think that it should be punitive think that more people should go to jail and should go for much long not just because it be deterrent but because it signal public outrage at these heinous act that be why it matter and everyone in the house should realise it my right hon friend have frequently raise this issue and we be in violent agreement in my experience there be intellectual snobbery towards people who think there be moral value in and an ethical basis for punish people properly anyone who talk about that often get label as some bigot who do not understand pattern of criminality and all these other thing of course they be important to consider but none of these thing mean that we should not appropriately punish people it shock that that still remain not part of the statutory purpose of sentencing punish people be important and we do not consider it enough for all the reason have set out this bill be incredibly important today be incredibly important too because it be the last chance for back bench mps to decide for themselves which part of this very significant bill they will support next week we will have third reading where labour mps will have no choice but to vote for or against the entire bill we know that major part of this bill be the early release of nearly all offender the opposition be oppose to the programme as whole but it be clear that this bill be major part of the government plan to reform sentencing it would be ask lot of labour mp to ask they to consider vote against the entire programme but we be not ask they to do that our amendment give labour mps the route through which they can most justifiably say to their whip and the prime minister no can support this we be ask they to say no and to vote against the early release of rapist paedophile seriously violent criminal criminal who cause death by dangerous driving and attempt murderer we be give labour mp clear route out of do what would be absolutely unprecedented in the management of offender in our prison and deep insult to the victim of serious violent and sexual crime labour mp many of whom have get to know work with and respect will know that spend the last week try my utmost to encourage they to avoid be put in position where the whip will make they vote to release rapist paedophile and serious violent criminal early most shadow ministers would happily sit back and watch labour mps vote for something that will blight their time in parliament in the eye of their constituent but we have not do that that be because whatever damage voting for this bill might do to the electoral prospect of labour mp what be more important to be that its measure do not go through as have say before understand the frustration that mps of different party have have over decade about the resource provide to our justice system and the prison estate mention on second reading that when labour be last in power it release more than prisoner early because of the capacity issue build up during its time in office this government and the last government have operate similar programme wish that emergency release measure never have to be use and if this be very big have ever be prime minister or chancellor during these period would have take different decision but at least these measure have to be announce in the full glare of the public eye carry political price and be genuinely legislate for as response to short term emergency challenge want labour mp to be absolutely clear eyed about the fact that what we be vote on today be not short term response to prison crowding challenge it be medium to long term plan decision about how we as country want to respond to people who commit serious violent and sexual offence have never meet victim of serious violent or sexual offence who think that the present system suitably punish serious offender have never meet victim who think that we should let these sort of people out of prison early but that be what this bill will do on second reading explain the sort of offence that be include in these measure minister have say that the very bad offender will be exclude since second reading the opposition have be able to review sentencing datum to try to understand what that mean in reality it highlight disturbing truth and leave the government and any mp who vote for this bill with difficult question to answer those serve extended determinate sentence and life sentence will be exclude from the early release element of this bill whereas those serve standard determinate sentence will not prisoner on standard determinate sentence will have their prison time cut every year more than of criminal send to prison for rape be on standard determinate sentence over of criminal send to prison for child grooming be on standard determinate sentence around half of criminal send to prison for attempt murder be on standard determinate sentence hundred of criminal guilty of child rape and sexual assault include rape of child under be in prison on standard determinate sentence in total more than criminal send to prison every year for serious violent sexual and other offence be give determinate sentence if labour mps vote against our amendment every single one of those criminal will be able to get out of prison early labour mp will be vote to let rapist and paedophile out of prison early indicate dissent the minister shake his head if he want to intervene and explain why that be not the case he can no he be not go to do so let we be clear early release will not be do on retrospective basis when the measure be enact every criminal in prison at that point in time will be able to benefit from these measure include thousand of serious criminal it be very clear to that what be be say by minister anticipate that they will say the same later in defence of these plan be in danger of mislead mp as it stand labour mp will have to vote in support of the government position that the most serious offender be exclude invite mps to reflect on how the justice secretary can possibly say that any rape let alone hundred of they be not one of the most serious offence will labour mp who vote against amendment tonight be able to say to survivor of child sex abuse that they support government who want to classify thousand of child sex offence as not be the most serious offence the government have say that early release will have to be earn through good behaviour but that be simply not true appreciate that it can be difficult to always believe what mps from opposition party be say but mp do not need to take my word for it the house of commons library briefing note on this bill be there in black and white for everyone to read it say as currently draft the provision of the bill do not bring in any new criterion for people to adhere to prior to be release at the one third or halfway point or any discretionary element to release will repeat that the bill provision do not bring in any new criterion labour mp need not look any far than emergency release measure and contrast they with this permanent long term change to find evidence that the government approach be totally unprecedented the scheme and other scheme that have come before and sit alongside it have many more exclusion for example sex offender yet this permanent non emergency approach do not what minister have be tell labour mp to secure their support be not accurate which should always make back bench mp wary if the government be make inaccurate statement about measure in bill that they want mp to support because they can not face the reality of what it do then mp should think very carefully about vote for it because there be no go back they will have to defend that decision this morning email every single labour mp the library briefing note so that they could see it for themselves regardless of whether they listen to this debate ignorance will be no excuse because today will not be the end of it guarantee member that the harsh reality be that history tell we that some of the criminal whom labour mp be be ask to vote to release will almost certainly commit further serious offence at time when they would otherwise have be lock up mp will then have to explain why they vote for non emergency change that let such people out early would not be surprised if one of these case be sufficiently serious that the government amend the bill measure in future in response to public backlash there be every chance that they will make labour mp go through the lobby tonight and vote for the indefensible and then at some point pull the rug from under they appreciate that lot of labour members be new to this place and they can speak to long serve member about how it will make they look when they be force to follow line that be later withdraw have make our position clear and have set out the consequence mp vote against our amendment this evening will be vote to reduce jail time for extremely violent criminal paedophile child groomer and rapist have do as much as can to stop that happen minister be resort to say thing about the bill measure that be inaccurate to secure support from their back benchers and mps should not let they get away with it we have set out clearly how our amendment would ensure that appalling criminal do not see their punishment cut know it be difficult for back benchers to stand up to the government and say no but if we do not thousand of the bad criminal will get out of prison early labour mp now have to decide whether to vote for what victim of child abuse family member of people kill by dangerous driver victim of rape and other want victim whom many of they care about or for what the prime minister and his whip want tell the prime minister no tell the whips no and vote for our amendment tonight will try to make my remark fairly brief not because be against short sentence but because recognise that there be time pressure would like to record my support for three amendment to the bill in the form of new clause to might say that agree with virtually everything that my good friend my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter say want to place on record my thank to the minister and his team for their engagement and time both before and since second reading my intention be to support the bill but also to seek to improve it on that basis have have extensive discussion with the justice union notably the prison officer in the prison officers association probation officer in napo prison educator in the university and college union and indeed staff in the public and commercial services union have add my name to new clause table by my good friend my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson which seek to ensure that the probation service not serco or any other private company oversee this increasingly important criminal justice technology as be the case in almost all of europe the key to the success of the bill be the tremendous opportunity for this new generation of electronic tagging of offender the new clause would also ensure that it be not the responsibility of an already overstretch prison service to tag offender before release not when serco be be pay handsomely for this contract as my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick have point out such contract be award by the previous conservative government and serco as the provider have suffer considerable financial penalty would like to pose number of question to the minister which hope he can respond to either in his speech or at later date do he agree with napo and the poa that with such huge expansion of electronic monitoring envisage by the bill the safeguard set out in new clause be sorely need do he also agree that we urgently need full debate about whether we want the public or the private sector in operational control of electronic tagging pay tribute to the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts hope have say her constituency name correctly and thank the hon member for ceredigion preseli ben lake for coach in its pronunciation although it be work in progress for table new clause to which have add my name this amendment call for probation to receive clean bill of health by his majesty inspectorate of probation before any increase in pressure on the service it also provide much need power to trigger what be call prioritisation framework so if there be serious concern about particular region or unit capability probation officer can focus on high risk case instead of non essential task the hon gentleman be an old friend and appreciate his attempt to improve the bill the new clause that he support be interesting and have merit will he acknowledge though that it be not just probation service that will be put under extra pressure by this bill but that the police will be too will he invite the minister when he sum up to talk about the extra resource he can make available to lincolnshire police and other authority as well as to the probation service to implement the provision of the bill that he have bring to the committee be grateful for that intervention which think be quite sensible and support the contention hope the minister will respond appropriately when he have the opportunity do the minister agree that hm inspectorate of probation should have the power outline in new clause they be just the sort of safeguard we need in the bill before more pressure be place on the probation service we be all aware that it be really overstretch principally as result of funding cut implement by the previous government and some of the decision take before the present government come into office finally be pleased to register my support for new clause in the name of my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell who be my good friend echo the concern that he express at length on second read about the potential for exploitation by private company such as when unpaid work in london be privatise in indeed that be criticise by the international labour organisation as an abuse do the minister agree with the probation union napo that unpaid work order should always be about payback to the community that they should be run for public good not for private profit and that this safeguard should be place in the bill call the liberal democrat spokesperson as the newly appoint justice spokesperson for the liberal democrats would first like to acknowledge the hard work of my predecessor my hon friend the member for eastbourne josh babarinde and his determination to make tangible change for those that have experience domestic abuse thank the government for their constructive collaboration with he by introduce into the bill domestic abuse identifi at the point of sentencing the identifier will give victim great confidence that their abuser be be appropriately deal with in the justice system but it would be reassure if the minister confirm that this identifier will be use to ensure that those perpetrator be exclude from any future early release scheme this bill present fantastic opportunity to address the endemic challenge that plague our justice system those challenge be the result of year of mismanagement by the conservatives whose decision have underpin the record backlog of case in the crown court as well as prison overcrowding and astronomically high reoffende rate with victim consistently fail at every stage we liberal democrats have hop that this bill would begin to shift the dial towards justice system that truly protect victim and rehabilitate perpetrator and there be indeed many element that we support and that show promise however we remain concerned that the scope and ambition of the bill be lack have have many of our amendment reject due to the lack of financing behind the bill many of the issue blight our justice system stem from lack of foresight and investment particularly in probation and prison as the hon member for easington grahame morris mention it be therefore disappointing that the bill do not include major effort to rectify that as party we be supportive of suspend short sentence of under month and have long campaign for this measure not only be it necessary step to address prison overcrowding but it would play vital role in reduce reoffende while of those serve custodial sentence of less than month go on to reoffend only reoffend if they be give suspend sentence end the cycle of reoffende be crucial to reduce crime level and relieve pressure on the justice system as the government have state there will be exception but they be yet to clarify what those exception will be will they include violent offender those convict for sexual offence against child and those who possess indecent image it would be very helpful if the minister lay out all the exemption we have table number of amendment aim at address our concern or further aspect of the bill new clause aim to address imprisonment for public protection ipp sentence be type of indeterminate sentence use in england and wales from to for dangerous offender who do not qualify for life sentence but still pose public risk these sentence feature minimum term but no maximum with release contingent on the parole board deeming the offender no long threat it be during the coalition government that we abolish ipp sentence but many remain in prison serve these sentence long after their tariff have expire our new clause would commence resentencing exercise which have cross party support and should be implement as priority the amendment be first recommend by the justice committee in and note that the chair of the justice committee the hon member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter have table similar measure new clause although we welcome the government approach to community sentencing reoffende rate be demonstrably high among those who be unemployed in the reoffende rate for those who be unemployed six week after release from prison be compare with for those who be employ at the same point amendment therefore call on the government to publish report assess whether the drive prohibition in the bill could impede an individual ability to attend work education or rehabilitation programme can the minister inform the house what assessment the government have make of that ensure access to those pathway be vital if we be to reduce reoffende effectively we be also concerned that the bill do not go far enough to support victim of violence against woman and girl know that this be one of the government key priority this parliamentary term yet without collect the datum it be an empty promise that it will be hard for the government to show they have actually achieve new clause would continue the important campaign of my hon friend the member for eastbourne to ensure that domestic abuse be treat as an aggravating factor in sentencing while new clause would require an assessment of the introduction of mandatory rehabilitation programme focus on violence against woman and girl for those convict of assault battery or actual bodily harm against woman or girl even if domestic abuse be not include as an aggravating factor these measure be design to ensure that victim of domestic abuse and related offence be place at the centre of the justice system work ensure that such crime be meet with appropriate sentence and that rehabilitation be specifically target at those who commit these serious offence in line with that approach new clause call for screen for traumatic brain injury among prisoner at the start of their custodial sentence brainkind study last year show that of woman in the criminal justice system in wales may be suffer with brain injury while government datum show that more than half of female prisoner be victim of domestic abuse these figure identify that significant proportion of the female prison population may have undiagnose brain injury result from domestic abuse leave many without the treatment they need and undermine their rehabilitation something that be certainly reflect in their ability to engage with probation service after leave prison comprehensive screening across the prison population would enable deep understanding of the link between trauma offend and reoffende new clause call on the secretary of state to examine the proceed generate from the propose income reduction order and to consider whether they could be ringfence to create dedicated fund for support victim new clause would allow the court to suspend the drive licence of an individual charge with certain driving offence pende the outcome of the trial as part of their bail condition many hon member across the house have harrowing case in their constituency of life lose at the hand of drunk driver drug driver or someone cause death by dangerous or reckless driving and the court backlog mean so often that those defendant be free to continue drive after the offence have occur sometimes wait for month in some case with drug test take up to six month to be receive the driver be free to continue to drive under the influence which be just plain wrong know that be feel deeply across the house new clause would address the ridiculous doom loop we find ourselves in with prisoner on remand arrive at their sentencing hearing be sentence and then be send home because the court backlog mean they have serve their sentence while be on remand and have not have access to any rehabilitative programme education therapy or other support the new clause would make rehabilitative programme accessible for those on remand we be also still concerned about number of unaddresse measure in the bill such as the recall provision which allow those recall to be release after day with no involvement from the parole board essentially provide get out of jail free card for reoffende this will not give the public confidence in the system would also be interested in the minister argument as to the purpose of provision in the bill to allow the probation service to publish name and picture of those take part in unpaid work the bill do contain some good idea to address some of the issue in our justice system but it could and should have go far especially if it have adequate resourcing as my hon friend the member for eastbourne state on second reading the bill be full of hope but fall short of both the liberal democrat ambition and the ambition that the government claim to have look forward to hear the government response to our question and encourage member across the house to support our amendment and new clause include new clause be go to make short speech on new clause table in my name and the name of other hon member after short relationship my constituent sophie hall have suffer and continue to suffer from prolonged and relentless stalk campaign from her ex partner who be reside illegally in the uk in november last year he be arrest for these offence but be never speak to about they as no interpreter could be find no risk assessment be do and he be place in temporary accommodation on bail which he continue to breach in february sophie ex partner be convict and sentence under the protection from harassment act and be subsequently deport to his home country of brazil with year re entry ban effective from march he then make his way to europe travel across several country before end up back in the uk in may he be arrest in belfast board flight to inverness his aim as always be to get to sophie the crown prosecution service then charge he with stalking and breach of restrain order and immigration offence and he be remand in custody after review the cps state that no charge could be file for stalk under the current law because the stalking have happen outside the uk the perpetrator be not uk citizen or resident and the exist law do not give the uk court jurisdiction over stalk offence commit from abroad under these circumstance this be the crux of new clause sophie ex partner be then place on remand and on september sentence to four year and four month for once again breach restraining order he be now in durham prison where he continue to show no remorse for or acknowledgement of the harm that he have cause sophie have be tell by her victim liaison officer that he be likely to be deport will be ban permanently from the uk and will receive lifetime restrain order prohibit he from ever contact sophie again whether abroad or in the uk though he have consistently stalk sophie include by send her letter when he be in detention centre because the home office fail to transfer information relate to his restraining order sophie do not think that she will ever be safe nor do she feel that the indefinite ban be much of deterrent once he be in brazil no one will have sight of he or manage the risk that he pose she know that he will try to travel back to she because he always do be aware from correspondence with the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girl that the government be already look at the extraterritorial jurisdiction of stalk legislation and that new measure on stalk will come forward in the crime and policing bill next week however have look at those measure carefully and they will do nothing at all to prevent what be happen to sophie sophie be right that it remain the case that online stalking of uk citizen by foreign national even if it be persistent harmful and criminal in nature can go unpunished simply because of where the perpetrator be locate when commit the abuse this legal loophole give perpetrator the freedom to act with impunity as long as they be physically outside the uk sadly there be many of we in this place who know the heart stop fear and worry when we see threat online or in writing know that the person who be make they will carry they out and do really mean it sophie have suffer this relentlessly she have be let down by the agency that be mean to protect she and the law have allow her perpetrator to continue to torment she sophie be not alone though paladin advocacy service which have work with on new clause be support many other victim as the law stand the uk have limit power to prevent foreign national convict of stalk from continue to harass their victim after be deport my new clause aim to rectify that as we move to an ever more digital world the capacity for people to stalk and perpetrate this kind of oppressive action on people will only grow just want to say how delighted be that the hon lady have table this new clause and hope we will hear from the minister that he will look at this matter carefully because this will be grow issue although as the hon lady have show with sophie it be already horrific in its impact thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention and support simply put want no one else to go through what sophie be go through she have to live her life in constant fear and have be through absolute hell hope that the minister will give my new clause proper consideration wish to speak to my new clause which call for the implementation of lifetime driving ban for those convict of cause death by dangerous or careless driving last year there be conviction for cause death by dangerous or careless driving of those conviction be for cause death by dangerous driving be for cause death by careless or inconsiderate driving be for cause death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drug two be for cause death by drive unlicensed or uninsured and three be for cause death by drive while disqualify few than of those convict of cause death by dangerous driving be give lifetime driving ban the figure be just two since there have be conviction for cause death by dangerous driving conviction for cause death by careless or inconsiderate driving conviction for cause death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drug conviction for cause death by drive unlicensed or uninsured and conviction for cause death by drive while disqualify there have be nearly conviction for cause death through negligence or recklessness of the driver those be thousand of life lose husband and wife who have lose their partner child who have lose parent and parent who have lose child thousand more life be impact tragically forever change shatter the hon gentleman be make very powerful speech with some shocking figure just last friday in my constituency surgery sarah imi come to talk to about her husband jason seven year ago he and his colleague be kill after work dinner by year old driving well above the speed limit and high on cannabis he be give fine and few hour of community service he have subsequently reoffende time include commit dangerous driving offence sarah have three teenage child at the time do the hon member agree that the family deserve justice and that this man should never be able to drive again thank the hon member for her contribution and wholeheartedly agree there be so many tale just like that from all our constituency and they indicate just how lenient we have be towards those convict of dangerous driving particularly those who have cause fatality that be precisely why table new clause believe that family like the one she mention deserve justice and the closure of know that those people will not go on to reoffend under section of the sentencing code any court may impose driving disqualification for any offence commit after january the minimum period of disqualification for cause death by careless driving be just month the sentencing guideline for drive disqualification follow conviction for cause death by drive illustrate the leniency that our judiciary apply to these case there be something badly wrong with our approach to justice when life be consider as cheap as it be in the current guideline the minimum period of disqualification for cause death by dangerous driving be five year consider that the threshold for dangerous driving be high as it cover excessive speeding drink driving and dangerous and erratic overtaking manoeuvre the type of driving that leave we horrify now consider case in which the outcome of that driving be that someone be kill the minimum disqualification period be five year an inconvenience it speak to narrative of whoop kill somebody the sentencing guideline include the option for lifetime disqualification but reluctance to impose it be currently price into the guideline which state lifetime disqualification will be rare in particular because of the increase risk of breach and the possibility of hinder rehabilitation prospect lifetime disqualification will generally be inappropriate unless there be psychiatric evidence evidence of many previous conviction indicate that the offender would be danger to the public indefinitely if allow to drive why be we so reticent to permanently remove killer driver from the road the guideline refer to an increase risk of breach but if someone be catch drive while disqualify have be ban from drive for life after kill someone perhaps we should send they to prison those who know will know that be far from anti motorist be no fan of low traffic neighbourhood blanket mph speed limit or terribly design cycle lane but while have be car enthusiast for many year be also cyclist and these day very much mamil middle aged man in lycra have be knock off my bike twice by car that do see have be doore and close pass at mph ride with camera on my bike so that there be evidence of be knock off and some of the driving could show would deter jeremy vine from ever rid bike in london again but have be lucky mike gough be not lucky mike be know in huntingdon for his passionate advocacy for road safety he too be keen cyclist and he often cycle on the country road around the town the very same road be out on this past weekend in march last year as he head back into huntingdon along the brampton road towards george street he be strike by ford transit van attempt to pass he paramedic attend the scene and attempt to give cpr but mike have be crush and could not be revive mike be pronounce dead at the scene along the brampton road today white ghost bike now mark the site as tribute to mike the driver receive month sentence suspend for two year and two year driving ban as it stand he will be back on the road before the next election mike relative say that the sentence do not reflect the seriousness of what have happen or the catastrophic impact on our life michael be the pinnacle of our family and huge part of the local community as family we will never be the same again and our grief be immeasurable it be with these event in mind that have table new clause the hon and gallant member speak very strongly about this issue there may be reticence to support his new clause because of the implication for rehabilitation but he have speak about the huge impact on family when life be take in that way can he give some reassurance about the balance between rehabilitate through custodial sentence for example and the lifelong impact on family of incident that happen in moment the hon member make valid point my amendment seek to remove the chance that those people will reoffend far down the track the custodial element remain unchanged so there will still be the possibility of rehabilitation through the prison system to reduce the rate of recidivism the issue here as the hon member for twickenham munira wilson also point out be about give family closure and the knowledge that those who be guilty of commit these crime will not be able to go on to reoffend new clause propose lifetime drive ban for death by dangerous or careless driving and related offence those cover at the beginning of my speech have speak to mike widow hazel and his daughter kim can say that it be sober to listen to somebody recount the story of the day that they have to attend the scene where their husband or father have just be kill selfishly it be sober to think about how easily it could have be ride the same road as mike do it be not an error or avoidable on his part the driver alone be at fault it be his casual negligence that cause mike death mike daughter kim recount on june the driver dennis roberts aged plead guilty to cause death by careless driving he be ban from drive with immediate effect give one year sentence suspend for two year two year driving ban hour unpaid work and have to pay court charge of around the sentence be within the guideline of the law but do the law fit the crime he have live his life like normal for month while we have lose our dad husband friend grandad and live the last month encompass in whirlwind of grief even after sentence he continue to live his life just with small inconvenience of not be able to drive and give up few hour to work unpaid how be that justice in two year time he will be able to drive again would you give someone who use gun carelessly and someone be kill their gun licence back after two year doubt it they would most likely have custodial sentence too would ask all member in the chamber to think how they might feel if they be to get phone call today inform they that their partner parent or child have be kill in road traffic accident my hon friend be give powerful speech like he be cyclist and have be subject to dangerous driving but be also driver and be sure that few of we would say that we have not drive carelessly at some point have he give think to whether lifetime ban would be appropriate in all circumstance for anybody who have ever cause death through carelessness be not yet convinced my right hon friend make valid point will talk later about whether it be too draconian the issue here be one of finality be sure we have all have close shave while drive car but the fact of the matter be that if driver have kill somebody no matter how unlucky that may have be that be final the grief of the family have speak to and the story have hear from other hon member show that we can not overstate how much of an impact that have on not just the life of the family but on friend and colleague there be opportunity that those people will never ever have beyond that unimaginable pain think how family might be leave feeling if they find that far from the accident have be unavoidable the death be cause by the reckless action of somebody who be play with their phone speeding drive like boy racer or drunk think of the feeling of injustice when the driver be sentence and receive little more than slap on the wrist the driver who kill mike be give two year driving ban hazel will never get to see mike again they will never have the opportunity to live out the rest of their life together kim say the long term impact on our family be huge although my mum have return to her job at the hospital she be unable to fulfil her role on rota and shift system and be unable to reduce she working hour she have therefore be force into take early retirement from job she have be at for nearly year we never want my dad to be statistic and to never be forget table new clause because of mike because of conversation with hazel and kim and because victim like he need justice which as thing stand they will not receive how can we put such an incredibly low tariff on be directly responsible for someone death the option to ban driver for life be at the court disposal yet it appear not to be the preference of judge that leniency suggest that life be cheap and that far from be tragedy death at the hand of someone careless or dangerous elicit little more than shrug of the shoulder in the event that somebody with licensed shotgun kill somebody because they be careless or bad still because they be dangerous would we allow they to regain their shotgun licence why do we so readily return people drive licence after they have take life there be an argument that lifetime ban be too draconian do not leave room for rehabilitation and will not work as deterrent the new clause be not suppose to be deterrent it be for the court to decide whether conviction should result in custodial sentence and thus what degree of rehabilitation and therefore recidivism should occur thereafter the new clause be not too draconian it be robust it would take driver who have kill permanently off our road and mean that those who have already prove themselves to be fatally unsafe behind the wheel would never again be in position to take another life or destroy any further life be move recently by the story of one family clare speak to sky news follow the conviction of the driver in their story she say it be normal saturday morning it be quite busy we be go to go home via the school fair and we get to the school crossing which be behind the school we press the button and wait for the car to stop she take couple of step out in front because she be responsibly cross and be encourage her brother to catch up and then in front of our eye he plough into she massively fast and he carry she off on his wing mirror ve get this very clear image of her be sweep off her foot and then she tumble off by the time get to she it be almost like she be go alice die few day later she be nine year old the light have be red for seven second when the driver overtake car to speed through the pedestrian crossing qadeer hussain be convict of cause death by dangerous driving he be sentence to eight year and four month in prison he be also disqualify from drive for year and two month he will be out in four clare victim impact statement illustrate the devastating effect of such tragedy feel blind chest crush white hot rage at you unlike any emotion ve ever feel before she be in the wrong place at the wrong time you be you know it all along helpless to express my anger that you stole everything from she table the new clause because believe that as nation we do not take the necessary step to make our road safe and we do not punish those responsible robustly enough should it go to vote believe that the support for it acknowledge by the government show that more robust measure be possible victim and their family deserve justice and while the issue of sentencing for these crime be wide discussion ensure that those responsible for destroy so many life do not drive on our road again be an issue that we could address in the committee today the new clause will never bring back the victim who have be lose nor heal the pain feel by those leave behind but it may offer some closure if such crime do not go unpunished and if cause fatality do not occur with impunity thank hon member who have support the new clause and ask everyone to vote in favour of it this evening thank the hon member for huntington ben obese jecty for speak to his new clause although do not support it because the minimum need to cause death by careless driving be momentary lapse of concentration of course he be talk about death and be not suggest for moment that that should go unpunished but full lifetime drive ban meaning that someone who have momentary lapse of concentration at still can not drive at do not feel proportionate however agree that we should look much more closely at all drive relate offence include all offence relate to dangerous driving careless driving and in particular cause death by dangerous driving those be horrendous crime have meet family who have be bereave in that way and those have be some of the most impactful conversation have have in my life the impact on those family simply can not be overstate we be expect the road safety strategy imminently and hope that these matter will be take forward on cross party basis and look at sensibly because it be really important topic totally understand what the hon lady be say about momentary lapse in concentration but that lapse have cost somebody their life be that anybody sit in this room that would be devastating consequence not just for they but for everyone here and everyone in their family recognise what she say about it not feel proportionate but there be nothing more final than lose one life to that extent believe it be proportionate drive be privilege and not drive be realistically only an inconvenience whereas the repercussion of family live their life without somebody be vast broadly agree with the hon member on the overall topic we should look at whether those offence be deal with with sufficient severity also agree that the impact on people family can not be overstate will the hon lady give way will make some progress and speak to amendment to clause that clause be the one that be most proud of it be the result of cross party work between the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde and the government front bench and it need to be give the prominence it deserve for the first time the clause will enable the recording and tracking of when domestic abuse be factor in an offence amendment which support discuss the ability to call for evidence as to whether there have be domestic abuse start from the fundamental position that we should believe woman on domestic abuse add that victim be predominantly though by no mean exclusively female none the less also strongly believe in the rule of law and the importance of have evidence that be why have sponsor the amendment table by my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter be sure that my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south dr gardner will more thoroughly address new clause and which be about gambling treatment be consider on par with treatment for drug and alcohol in the court those on the conservative benches have suggest that government members be in some way anti punishment we be not absolutely believe that crime should be punish but also absolutely believe that rehabilitation service be critical to prevent the recurrence of crime when of criminal offending be reoffende we have to look seriously at how we break those cycle of offending welcome and applaud the clause put forward by my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south gambling create significant social problem in our society and when that extend to crime we need solution new clause and both address the potential abolition of the sentencing council the language with which they have be address by opposition members today have be bit more circumspect than some of what we have hear they say previously about the sentencing council in this chamber our judge in the uk be some of the good in the world the independence of our judiciary be an absolutely fundamental premise of our democracy and the way in which it have be talk about recently treat it with complete disdain that terrify it be one of the most important principle that our country stand upon the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan say that the conservative still respect the independence of the rule of law but have hear member on those benches refer to lefty activist judge as if somehow the judiciary in britain be populate by radical marxists that be not the case be lawyer and spend year in practice have never meet judge who be anything but genuinely commit to the apolitical upholding of the law hon member hear hear it be incredibly important that we continue to recognise and promote those principle say that partly from genuine ideological position and partly from experience britain have export billion in legal service in the last year one of the reason for that level of success be that there be genuine belief in our judiciary people in multiple jurisdiction across the world trust that our judge will hear dispute impartially when we talk like conservative members have in criminal or civil context we damage not only our institution but our economy we have to understand the importance of the british rule of law and we need to promote and uphold it at all cost those who do not do so damage our country hon member hear hear do the hon member think it appropriate for an immigration judge to support and advocate for charity that be actively try to stop asylum law be implement should an immigration judge be involve in an organisation like that do not know the detail of the case to which the hon member refer which make it impossible for to give an informed comment by return none the less can genuinely say speak from or year experience practise as solicitor before come to this place as well as lot of time spend in the labour party and meeting leftie people that the two do not really overlap they just do not do the hon lady accept that in democracy it be important to be able to hold everybody to account include judge do she accept that we need to be able to check that they be make good decision on behalf of everybody the hon member appear to be ignore the entire recruitment process for the judiciary which fundamentally at its heart emphasise the independence of those people from political interference and also the fact that the application of the law should not be subject to political interference in this place that be absolutely fundamental judge be not get up every morning and just come up with ludicrous leftie position the picture that be sometimes paint by those on the opposition benches be just fanciful it bear no relationship to my experience of engage with the actual judiciary on an ongoing basis would the hon lady agree that it be outrageous that member of this house should hold up judge wig at party conference and that judge therefore have increase security risk the member of the judiciary that have speak to have very genuine concern about their personal security particularly immigration judge they be genuinely frightened of do their job and that will be affect judicial recruitment we need immigration judge to be able to stand up and serve the judiciary many judge take pay cut to become judge and they deserve our genuine respect they work very hard in system that have be grotesquely underfunde for year lastly would like to mention new clause which be table by the liberal democrats have refer to cross party work elsewhere understand that it might not be in the exactly right format for the government to it take forward today but hope that the minister will consider how we will deal with the fact that people be not receive training when they be on remand and be often release at the end of that time it be serious issue that deserve serious consideration have ask previously in the justice committee about what work be do with people on remand particularly in respect of domestic abuse offence in my opinion we be miss an opportunity for people without accept any sort of guilt to engage in service that many would benefit from consider their general behaviour irrespective of whether their original offence be relate to domestic abuse in fact all of we could benefit from those opportunity for reflection people spend lot of time in prison and at the moment it be not be use as effectively as and many other would like it to be that bring back to my original point government members absolutely believe in punishment but fundamentally we also believe in rehabilitation and the emphasis on that in this bill be very much to be welcome will speak to my new clause new clause on probation capacity and new clause on the devolution of probation to wales also support new clause and as well as new clause and which relate to relate to ipp sentencing first let commend the diligent work of my constituent rhianon bragg and fellow activist who have help place vital victim safeguard measure on the face of the bill particularly in relation to the restriction zone condition in clause and have question and subsequently write to the secretary of state for further clarification on the detail of those measure and look forward to his response which will help provide those vital assurance to rhianon and other victim and survivor the measure entail put the restriction condition around the perpetrator rather than the victim and that be major step ahead in our approach to look after victim there be no escape the fact that the bill will heap extra pressure on the probation service which be slowly come back from be on its knee follow the transformation of rehabilitation under the last government would like to put on the record that last week have the honour of address the annual conference of the probation officer union napo in my capacity as co chair of the justice union parliamentary group speaker after speaker at the conference include chief inspector martin jones warn that probation officer be under unprecedented pressure and simply can not cope with their current workload staff be genuinely worried that the bill will make that already acute problem worse and will risk destabilise the service far which will lead to great risk to public protection that be why as be propose in new clause an independent assessment of whether the probation service have the capability and the capacity to take on additional work be vital new clause which be fully support by napo would require the inspectorate approval to be provide before extra pressure be place on our overstretch probation service by provision in the bill it would also empower the inspectorate to trigger special measure for probation delivery unit or entire region and prioritisation framework that would give probation officer more flexibility to focus on high risk case and drop the non essential and low priority task that take up so much of their time since those year when there be so much pressure on the probation service probation officer have effectively be penalise for their willingness to take responsibility for risky decision which we be go to require they to make if we be to enable probation officer to do their work more effectively we must give they the capacity to think through the risk in order to be prepare not to go ahead on the safe possible route currently only regional probation director have the power to ask for their region or unit to be put into the prioritisation framework the criterion for which be tell be base solely on the number of probation officer napo believe that criterion to be wholly inadequate as it do not take into account the grade of the staff or their workload and that it must be broaden to take into account probation officer day to day workload rest such power with director also disincentivise the trigger of special measure because it lead to accusation of their be allow to mark their own homework if the inspectorate have that power instead there could be an objective holistic assessment of the full capacity of that area which would include much broad criterion than be currently the case sincerely hope that the government will listen and support the spirit if not the specific text of new clause new clause would do what many have long call for devolve probation and offender management to wales by amend the government of wales act that be not political ask it be an operational one and it come from within the service when napo cymru executive su mcconnel give evidence to the welsh affairs committee in may she not only provide on the ground insight into the reality of the probation service in wales but make it clear that the uk government be ignore expert advice by refuse to turn away from their fail centralised approach to probation locally base and community centre probation be desperately need and be loudly advocate for by probation staff in wales and expert and academic alike as the chair of the thomas commission rightly say follow question from my plaid cymru colleague in the other place it would be useful to know why the unanimous recommendation of completely apolitical group of expert be think to be wrong by the uk government add to that the recommendation of the silk commission report the gordon brown report and that of the independent commission on the constitutional future of wales gordon brown former labour prime minister make this recommendation although the report recommend the devolution of justice to wales to various degree the devolution of probation be an undebatable commonality it be ask for by all those report this be not an ill prepare amendment it be root in year and mountain of evidence datum and analysis this be what the expert say need to be do for the situation in wales where we have the jagged edge of devolution and so many of those critical service already devolve this be different from any region of england and for it to work more effectively the devolution of probation would be the first step in bring all that together if this proposal make it into law wealth of knowledge would be at our fingertip wait to be use as the now disaggregate justice datum for wales have be finally publish after year and year of demand it mention in particular the diligent work of cardiff university dr rob jones in help secure that datum and look forward to his analysis of it the point be that if probation be finally devolve the datum could inform our service and practice in the specific context of wales address the structural issue that we see and experience and integrate with those area crucial to rehabilitation that have already be devolve for over quarter of century namely health housing and social policy that be what people on the frontline actually want probation officer be cry out for reorganisation and for welsh probation system uncouple from the prison service and inform by and responsive to our community that be what they know will work for they on the frontline not for executive at the ministry of justice or at private company this will work well for community in wales instead of ideologically cling on to centralised england and wales service and explore as we understand the government intend to do the prospect of devolve probation this labour uk government should just get on with it labour in wales agree with plaid cymru and it agree back when the conservatives be in government that justice should be devolve in full when the conservatives be in government labour in wales push for that but now we have labour in power at both end of the we be experience watering down of those ambition for wales what be say before be not be say now and that be deeply disappointing with so many of our social policy lever already devolve full devolution would provide wales with the opportunity to create and implement cohesive holistic justice and rehabilitation strategy that work for the people of wales and for our specific community and need look forward to hear the minister response to these argument on both amendment at the close of the debate and hope to see his government act on the actual call of probation staff deal with these issue on the frontline will speak to new clause gambling treatment requirement and new clause gambling addiction support for offender thank the minister and the ministry of justice the nhs the department for culture media and sport and the department of health and social care for their sustained engagement and understanding on this topic these be probe amendment and will withdraw they however wish to highlight the real urgency with which we must treat gambling disorder with parity of esteem to drug and alcohol addiction in the criminal justice system gambling can be fun hobby which many of we enjoy even like flutter on the lottery and have soft spot for bingo but what begin as the odd bet or game can quickly escalate and some sadly spiral into problem gambling once an addiction take hold disorder gambling can break down family cause people to lose their job and may trigger criminal behaviour those affect may turn to acquisitive crime to fund their addiction or pay their debt and affect other may turn to crime to recoup their partner debt problem gambling be associate with not only acquisitive crime but street violence domestic abuse and neglect that of course lead to many harm for the person themselves their family and the victim of their crime although the link between problem gambling and crime remain relatively under research the available evidence illuminate several concern trend problem gambler be over four time more likely to be in prison while there be example of good support specific to problem gambling there be currently no statutory requirement to provide treatment to people convict of gambling relate offence have receive report of people with problem gambling only be give treatment design for drug or alcohol dependency general mental health support or no treatment at all none of those option treat the very specific and complex issue relate to problem gambling and crime without this people risk enter cycle of reoffende with harm escalate each time and more and more victim be give case recently in which woman who develop gambling addiction after traumatic life event receive no support during her custodial sentence she be instead direct to drug and alcohol course which she find incredibly unhelpful in another case man imprison be not offer any treatment in custody at all and experience rife culture of gambling while in prison he leave prison with no treatment and no path to recovery it must be acknowledge that in many case gambling disorder be one part of wide network of vulnerability contribute to offend and reoffende problem gambler often struggle with alcohol or drug misuse mental health issue or underlie trauma my hon friend be make powerful case that wholeheartedly support she be outline not only the real problem that gambling addiction cause but the trauma that often lead to it which show how important rehabilitation be we have hear much from opposition members today about how everybody should be punish and how this bill be soft option do my hon friend agree that require people to drill down into the cause of their offending be far from an easy option it be very difficult thing to ask people to do and it be essential that we give they the support they need to look at their life and turn it around thank my hon friend for her intervention and wholeheartedly agree prison should be rehabilitative any offender should have that support to prevent reoffende it be right for our society it be right for potential victim and it be right for offender who often resort to criminality due to very severe personal circumstance and trauma gambling disorder be recognise as mental health condition lead mental health assessment tool such as the the fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental the world health organisation international classification of disease classify gambling as an addiction with similar cognitive and psychological effect to those of substance use disorder research indicate that once an individual begin chase their gambling loss with further gambling their cognitive functioning become impaired change can occur in brain chemistry and neurocognitive function and the ability to make rational decision such as choose whether to engage in criminal behaviour to manage debt or to continue gamble become compromise there be the link the criminal justice system recognise the psychological impact of drug and alcohol dependency drug and alcohol dependency be mitigate factor with sentence guideline treatment pathway and rehabilitation requirement as set out in the sentencing act my hon friend be make very strong argument draw parallel between gambling addiction and drug and alcohol abuse early this year as member of the public accounts committee question government official about the endemic use of drug in prison the carol black report look at this back in order how long have you be in the chamber have you just walk in no have not just walk in this be the third speech have listen to okay make sure your intervention be short lot of drug user be repeat offender as my hon friend be say about those with gambling addiction do she agree that shift to community provision might enable people to get the rehabilitation they need for their addiction whether it be drug alcohol or gambling do reiterate that to break the cycle of reoffending or recidivism rehabilitation must be at the heart of all sentencing and punishment be it community or custodial under the sentencing act an individual suffering from drug and alcohol addiction receive targeted support through the alcohol treatment and drug treatment requirement for community order and suspend sentence yet no such legislation ensure that individual serve community order or suspend sentence for relate offence seek rehabilitative treatment pre sentence report can include problem gambling and the court may decide that an offender be suitable for mental health treatment requirement as part of community order or suspend sentence however although problem gambling be associate with depression and heighten risk of suicide the mental health treatment requirement do not directly treat gambling disorder at present no specific requirement directly address disorder gambling new clause seek to resolve that by establish statutory gambling treatment requirement for those serve community order or suspend sentence most of those face custodial sentence leave custody without treatment they do not recover from their addiction and they be at an increasingly high risk of reoffende after lose their home job and experience family breakdown prison be often hotbed for gambling activity and treatment be absent ten per cent of man report gambling regularly while in prison and of people on probation report gamble more than once week gambling disorder should therefore be recognise throughout the criminal justice process where gambling disorder be causal factor as with drug and alcohol treatment court should be empower to impose community order and suspend sentence that include referral to specific gambling disorder treatment where custody be impose prison should provide access to gambling treatment and peer support equivalent to that available for drug and alcohol addiction new clause and seek to establish statutory parity ensure that treatment base sentencing option be available with continuity of care in both custody and upon release there be already example of good practice gamlearn offer incredible support and its model show what work treatment peer support and family support the west midlands gambling harms clinic offer free evidence base specialist psychological therapy to individual harm by gambling train psychological professional provide cognitive behavioural therapy in variety of format include silvercloud confidential online platform online support could follow people if they be move on whether in custodial or community sentence ensure continuity of support thank gamlearn and the west midlands gambling harms clinic for work with also thank sarah page from staffordshire university whose research have be instrumental in highlight the challenge face by problem gambler in the criminal justice system although will not be press my amendment believe that we must break the cycle of reoffende and make difference to individual their family and their victim without statutory recognition and parity with drug and alcohol addiction people in recovery be be hold back their family be destabilise and prison be leave to manage untreated addiction without dedicated provision again acknowledge the positive engagement with the minister thus far and support the bill look forward to further discussion about the work be do to provide appropriate rehabilitative treatment for those convict as result of their problem gambling today speak in favour of the eight amendment table by reform uk simply put the bill be motivate by the desire to free up prison space and not by what be the good way to administer justice its primary function be not the protection of the public or the protection of victim of crime or abuse in fact it be the opposite clause be about the presumption of suspension of custodial sentence of month or less we propose an amendment to remove clause which effectively discourage the magistrate court from impose custodial sentence there be circumstance when custodial sentence of month or less be entirely appropriate and the clause be tie the hand of magistrate who will be under pressure from the clerk not to impose prison sentence what do that mean for those find in possession of bladed article namely knife an offence that currently attract mandatory six month prison sentence with this presumption of suspension clause be the minister now suggest that offender who be find guilty of carry knife will now have their sentence automatically suspend if so what do this mean for knife crime on our street and the protection of the public community sentence option be often limit due to defendant claim anxiety and depression mean that unpaid work be not an option and that tagging may be limit in addition fine be often meaningless because so many defendant be claim universal credit let turn to clause and we have table new clause which would abolish the sentencing council all together the sentencing council be introduce to give statutory guidance to the judiciary to avoid inconsistency in sentencing decision however we believe that its work have become prescriptive and politicised as show by clause we live in an era of two tier justice let we not forget that in march the sentencing council propose treat ethnic minority offender more leniently than white offender the justice secretary have to step in and overrule the sentencing council in order to stop this madness for these reason the sentencing council should be abolish and sentence power should lie solely at the discretion of judge sit on the public accounts committee early this year we investigate the state of our prison system and all the sort of thing that one should describe as restorative justice the fact be that our prison be overflow they be not make anybody any well or turn people around and they do not provide restorative justice as know to my own cost it cost four time more to keep prisoner in prison for year than it do to send boy to eton thank the hon lady for the eton example be sure that will resonate very well with my constituent in runcorn do the hon lady agree that if there be not enough prison place then we should build more of they not let people out of prison that be what we should be remember this be government who find untold amount of money to house illegal immigrant we need to do the same for prisoner absolutely agree with the right hon on point of order ms ghani the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor just swear at my hon friend the member for runcorn and helsby sarah pochin indicate dissent can see that the hon gentleman in question be shake his head so assume that no swearing have actually take place can he confirm that indicate assent sarah pochin will you please continue we propose an amendment to remove clause all together the clause propose to reduce the time serve of custodial sentence from half to third in order to free up prison capacity this mean that dangerous criminal who have be lock up for some of the bad possible offence include paedophile could be let back into the community after serve only third of their sentence behind bar only the most serious offender include those convict of rape will serve half their sentence in jail reduce from two third interruption as the hon lady be lay out the reality government members be chuntere and suggest that what she be say be not true so may point out that the library briefing clearly say that those with sentence of over four year for violent or sexual offence who be currently release at the two third point of sentence would be release at the halfway point under the new provision that be fact thank shadow minister for support on that point turn to clause and with respect to licence these clause all give power to the probation service to reduce the length of community order impose by the judge or magistrate the probation service be underfunde and overstretch already and the real risk be that offender will have their requirement reduce by probation officer in order to free up capacity in the service the probation officer already have discretion on the number of day of rehabilitation require and it be dangerous to give any more quasi judicial power to the probation service will the hon member give way no will make some progress have give way lot let move on and make point of clarification with respect to clause and which be on recall the current system allow for fix term recall of day for custodial sentence of less than month and day for custodial sentence of one to four year standard recall offender serve the rest of their sentence can the minister confirm that this bill introduce ftr and sr of day for all custodial sentence of less than four year with the exception of terrorist such that offender who have commit serious crime include assault robbery and possession of knife or other offensive weapon could be out again in two month that be not protect the public however welcome the fact that the presumption of day recall do not apply for domestic violence offender who have breach their licence condition and go on to reoffend clause be about foreign criminal propose to replace the clause and to move new clause which would apply an automatic deportation order to foreign criminal sentence to at least six month imprisonment or six month community sentence the secretary of state write to member of parliament claim that he have strengthen the ability of the government to deport foreign criminal he say in letter that it will be the duty of the home secretary to deport foreign offender who receive at least month custodial sentence yet in the same letter he state that this be subject to several exception include where to do so would be breach of person echr right or the uk obligation under the refugee convention in other word nothing will change and no one will get deport finally new clause would make an addition to the bill refer to as criminal cases review public petition under the new clause if it appear to any british citizen age or over that the sentencing of person in the crown court have be unduly lenient or harsh that british citizen the petitioner may refer the case to the criminal cases review commission for it to review the sentence there would mean that there would be platform for defendant like rhys mcdonald and chris taggart in my constituency who receive an average of month for an ill advise tweet to have their sentence appeal call catherine atkinson interruption call john mcdonnell thank you ms ghani it be nice to be substitute like other in the chamber be member of the justice union parliamentary group and will speak very briefly to new clause as many member know the justice union group comprise the probation officer union napo as well as the prison officers association and the pcs it act as the voice of the frontline worker in parliament from those particular union there be an overall welcoming of the bill by the union themselves which be good but specific concern have be raise with we with regard to the development of unpaid work and community service and how that be manage in the future many member will also know about the history of community service in fact in the past we have have few member in this house who do bit of community service but that be another issue all together historically it have be way in which people have be able to avoid prison sentence by work in the community and make reparation for the damage that they have often cause in it think we can report that it have be relatively successful in most of our constituency unfortunately though there have be experiment with privatisation include of the management of the service and there have be debate about whether this could be unpaid labour for private company in london in community service be privatised to serco it be an absolute disaster there be lack of supervision on site lack of worker and lack of tool be deliver it be also expose that offender be sometimes be cram into vehicle that be unsuitable and unsafe as result that privatisation collapse the last government then engage in wholesale privatisation of probation under the title transformation of rehabilitation that include unpaid work and community service again even the last government have to accept that probation would have to be bring back in house because of combination of incompetence and profiteering alongside failure to go for realistically effective rehabilitation during that period the national association of probation officers express to the government its opposition to privatisation and take action by refer the matter to the international labour organisation as breach of the ilo convention on forced labour the ilo find in favour of the union frame its judgment in this way all work or service that be exact from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the say person have not offer himself or herself voluntarily be force labour it make an exception of work as consequence of conviction in court of law however the ilo also say that the person must not be hire or place at the disposal of private individual company or association the union be seek an assurance from the government that they will abide by the ilo convention and will not place this force labour with private company as that would enable those company to profiteer from those worker and would prevent those who want job from be hire legitimately the union also ask that we prevent repetition of the disaster of privatisation it say that if there be an increase in community sentence there obviously have to be adequate staffing through the probation service as have be say and recognition of the failure of the private sector to manage this process in the past the union want to remind member that there be requirement for supervision to be adequately staff because there be concern about the nature of unpaid labour placement and how they will be supervise in future there be already concern about what be happen we be deal with case involve people who have commit knife crime domestic violence or stalking and there be issue with the mental health of some of the offender be supervise as well as drug relate issue there be fear of heighten risk if privatisation be attempt again and if private company offer placement in their company for the sake of profiteer all new clause seek be an assurance from the minister preferably in the bill that unpaid work will be undertake only for non profit organisation in the past such work have be undertake for these body include social enterprise voluntary organisation and yes local authority work with local community initiative the private sector should never be allow to profit from such work welcome my right hon friend clarification that charity would still be able to provide these placement have fantastic charity in my constituency upcycle which teach bike maintenance skill to help rehabilitate people currently that be do in prison but when there be more community sentence that sort of charity will want to give people skill and meaningful work in the community just want to clarify that this be not about exclude charity that be exactly in the tradition of community service as it be found and develop over the year but the experiment with privatisation have be disaster there be an argument that once system start use the private sector as in america offender become economic unit for exploitation and profiteering the justice unions parliamentary group warn that we should not venture down that path both as result of historical failure and give what have happen in other country when the private sector have be able to use offender in that way the new clause be about return to the traditional community service approach in this country it be relatively effective but in this new sentencing bill which we welcome it will be expand on scale perhaps not envisage in the past it be as simple as that the right hon member be well known for his long term support for the prison officers association while he be on his foot will he commit to support our new clause which would close the loophole relate to whole life order for the murder of prison officer declare an interest as an honorary life member of the prison officers association this be about the only time have disagree with it will not support that measure although understand where it be come from and understand that there may well be review of sentencing and what be take into account when these action tragically occur to have mandatory sentence like that would most probably not be appropriate although the shadow minister be right that the prison officers association have argue strongly for the measure and respect that my final point relate not to new clause but to the amendment table by my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter on the naming and shaming of offender and the idea that offender photograph will be publicise locally he suggest in his amendment that there should be much wide consultation on the issue and probation officer be say exactly the same thing lot of their role in rehabilitation be about ensure that people have connection with their family once again they be concerned about the effect that name and shaming have on the family and in particular the child sometimes the family serve the sentence alongside the offender and we would not want any action take that increase the stigma for family member of offender if the government be go down this path there be need for more detailed and widespread consultation and discussion last week meet one of my constituent tracey hanson in parliament to honour the year anniversary of the tragic loss of her son josh who be murder in an unprovoked knife attack in hillingdon west london in october we speak about the tireless work that she have put into campaigning for victim right and hear more about how the law that she want to introduce josh law would ensure that the right of victim and their family to appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme be clear and equal to the right of offender will speak specifically to new clause table by my hon friend the member for the beautiful bexhill and battle dr mullan after cruelly take the life of josh hanson shane abscond and evade police for three and half year before he be finally catch dub britain most wanted man at the time be sentence to at least year in prison just one year above the minimum sentence after just miss the deadline to appeal the sentence as result of unclear information about victim family right under the unduly lenient sentence scheme tracey have spend year campaign to ensure that no other victim face what her family do unfortunately far too many victim and their family face the same problem simply because they be not be make aware of their right to appeal sentence there be also concern number of case in which clerical error in one case hear of it be an email stick in barrister outbox lead to the attorney general run out of time and miss the deadline to appeal sentence while appeal from offender will still be consider by the attorney general outside the day window in exceptional circumstance appeal from victim or their family will not historically victim be at the centre of the justice system victim be the drive force in bring criminal case and play central role throughout the process it be not until the century that there be significant shift towards state lead prosecution with the victim rather than criminal case significantly diminish the focus only start to shift back towards the victim with the very recent introduction of the first victim charter in believe that we must recapture more of the focus from the state and divert it back to those who be most directly impact by crime the life of tracey and her family will never be the same again they should have be central focus in the criminal case and should have receive the same right and information about their right to appeal against the sentencing decision as the offender do it be vital that victim and their family be clearly inform about their right to appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme new clause would require the crown prosecution service to write to victim or their next of kin within work day of sentence be pass provide detail of the unduly lenient sentence scheme the application process for the scheme and the deadline which would also be extend give victim well chance of benefit from the scheme my hon friend be make bold case on behalf of victim hope that he will agree that the more we agonise about the circumstance of the guilty the more we displace consideration of the effect on the innocent over the whole of my lifetime the focus on the circumstance of wicked people have have exactly that effect and unfortunately it have permeate so much of the establishment include the judiciary sentence be sometimes inadequate for that very reason think that the justification for not change that approach over many year have be an argument about finality of sentence and give the offender that finality do not think that stack up today we need to afford victim more right and more sensitivity within the system new clause be total common sense and should be support by member on both side of the committee it put victim at the heart of sentencing and do not compromise the need for finality in sentencing it push the date back but it do not change the status of that finality want to speak about new clause and amendment and in my name the government commitment to tackle violence against woman and girl be never just pledge never just slogan it have always be about action about change thing for woman girl and victim everywhere for the well we have see that time and again under this government indeed just today they announce that child sexual abuse offender convict of serious sex offence against any child will now automatically lose their parental responsibility after be sentence rather than victim have to be drag through the tough and costly family court process this bill move we forward in our mission to halve violence against woman and girl in decade as chair of the all party parliamentary group on perpetrator of domestic abuse have always argue that we must focus on tackle perpetrator behaviour instead of ask why do she leave we must ask why do he stop therefore welcome the new restriction zone that the bill will introduce which will limit the movement of perpetrator rather than victim and the increase use of tagging be also pleased to see the new judicial finding of domestic abuse which will revolutionise our understanding of sentencing for domestic abuse and ensure that we can exclude perpetrator from future measure that put victim at risk will the hon lady give way no will make progress the expansion of specialist domestic abuse court be also very exciting be concern however by the provision that allow for the automatic re release of recall perpetrator after day and fear that they may place some victim at serious risk of harm those who perpetrate crime such as domestic abuse and stalking know everything about their victim where they live where they work where their child go to school their regular routine and we know how fixate such abuser can be although welcome the exemption of those manage under mappa multi agency public protection arrangement category and must note that this will not capture the vast majority of domestic abuser by the point perpetrator be sentence it be likely that their victim have already be subject to abuse for year safelives domestic abuse charity have find that high risk victim live with domestic abuse for year they will just be begin to rebuild their life when their perpetrator be release from prison if the perpetrator go on to harass their victim their probation officer may decide to recall they to prison but after day they will be release again potentially to harass or abuse they may again be recall and then release again day later can see no provision in the bill to prevent this cycle which could end in serious harm or the death of victim it be right that breach of domestic abuse protection order or other order may send perpetrator straight back to prison however the sad truth be that victim may not always recognise breach of an order or they may be too scared to call it in even when they do very few breach be act on by the police recall be an important tool in ensure that victim be safeguard in the short term but we can not create system in which there be cycle of ever increase risk as result have table amendment and and new clause which seek to address this issue by ensure that any offender who be recall on the basis of contact with their victim be not automatically release after day but be instead holistically risk assess and hold in custody until their risk to the victim have be reduce to the extent that it can be manage in the community by break the cycle my amendment would address some of the concern raise by senior police and probation official regard the resource pressure of recall and hold in custody we know what the tories do to address the prison overcrowding crisis absolutely nothing and we will not take lecture from they in clear up their mess and avoid the collapse of our criminal justice system we must ensure that safeguard victim be our first priority look forward to work with the government and colleague from across the house to ensure that we can do just that finally be interested to hear about new clause table by the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller on screen for traumatic brain injury work with brain injury researcher on their early research on screening and hope that the minister look closely at this vital new clause have not intend to start this way but will do so follow the last remark by the hon member for lowestoft jess asato about acquire brain injury be chairman of the all party parliamentary group for acquire brain injury and we recently hold session specifically on the relationship between acquire brain injury and the criminal justice system she be quite right to emphasise that will say no more in detail about it except to refer the minister to the report that we publish which include section on criminal justice and acquire brain injury beyond that in talk about the fundamental consideration of this bill want to speak about the fact the reason for they their effect and the alternative very much in the spirit that my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey speak in when move her amendment recommend her amendment almost without reservation they be bold attempt to rescue the bill from the damage it might do do not claim that that damage be intentional because do not think that anyone in this house intend to do harm we would not be here if we do none the less as my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle dr mullan say harm whether unintended or otherwise will be the result of this legislation it be undeniable be afraid that the government present to the house paradox on one hand they say that this bill be necessary because of practicality include the inadequate number of prison place that be plausible argument because the prison population have grow as we hear early in the debate and we simply do not have enough place to accommodate all those who might be send to prison on the other hand they say that it be matter of principle and they tell we that short sentence do not work in do so they be concede to the rehabilitationist argument that have pervade criminal justice thinking and criminology more generally for the whole of my lifetime remember that when be study criminology at university there be exactly that narrative other academic challenge it philip bean the criminologist write definitive book call rehabilitation and deviance in which he make the case for just retribution the public certainly believe that the criminal justice system should be retributive my right hon friend be talk about contradiction in the government position but be there not another one labour members and ministers in particular talk about the volume of people who be go to be release as result of their measure but whenever they be confront with example of actual offence commit by the sort of offender they will be let go they always say well it would apply to they the government can not have it both way either lot of people be get out of prison include some of these people or they be not they have to make up their mind it be certainly true that very significant proportion of criminal be repeat offender and there be people who choose to live life of crime this be not an illness to be treat it be malevolent choice to be deal with through punishment because we need to punish people for do harm that be not complicated it be what all our constituent would take as read yet as say we seem to agonise about it perpetually refer to my early comment the datum show that one in four prisoner be drug user and have drug and alcohol problem and they constitute many of the reoffender give that datum do the right hon member not agree with that we should be rehabilitate and medically treat those addiction so that they be not catch up in the criminal justice system it be certainly true that one perverse choice lead to other consequence and when people become involved in drug it often lead to all kind of horror the key thing be therefore to stop people get involve in drug and successive government include this one have intend to do that through series of measure we try to deter people from involvement in drug to deal with drug dealer and to do all the other thing that you will not allow to speak about at length madam deputy speaker because would be deviate from the content of the amendment if do order you should learn that one temper oneself sir john be extremely grateful madam chairman this be very much still on topic the challenge with the argument that labour members put forward on rehabilitation be that it presuppose that all we need to do be put someone on drug rehabilitation course once and they will stop offend and it be all fantastic the evidence show the complete opposite even the very good drug rehabilitation course that money can buy at the priory have long term success rate of about in reality whatever we do some of these offender be go down path from which they will not be turn for significant length of time and that be when we have to put they in prison do agree with my hon friend just step back moment ms ghani be mindful that the only female speaker we have ever have once famously declare call madam so will from now on call you madam chairman rather than anything else it be certainly true that we need war against drug drug dealing and all the effect of drug but it would be quite wrong to separate that from the public desire to see people who do bad thing deal with appropriately when those bad thing be at their extreme and as my right hon friend the member for tatton point out we be speak of extreme act of violence against woman minor and let we face it man they need to be deal with with severity there be nothing wrong with say that because it be what most people intuitively feel and it be right that they do grotius the jurist once say that criminal justice be about the infliction of an ill suffer for an ill do and that sense that the punishment must fit the crime ring true now as it do when he make that observation the minister need to explain whether the bill be about practicality or principle have yet to determine which position the government have take just want to highlight the fact that it be possible to believe that offender need to be punish as do when be an officer be part of deliver that punishment and simultaneously that rehabilitation should be part of the prison system while agree with the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan that some offender be not ready to begin the rehabilitation journey that do not mean that we should not stand ready to provide it for those who be ready as it ultimately drive down reoffende and reduce the number of victim which should be at the heart of everything we do punishment and rehabilitation need to work hand in hand the hon lady make valid point while attack the rehabilitationist dogma do of course believe that we should try to save soul and the good way of do that be to address people fundamental problem as many member across the committee have say in the course of this debate that might be about ensure that people have adequate learning or it might be about the acquisition of particular skill the hon lady will know from her rich experience in these matter that if someone can get job when they leave prison they be much less likely to reoffend when someone in those circumstance be unable to get job it be usually result of the fact that they do not have core skill in term of basic competency or specialist skill where those can be provide through learn in prison that undoubtedly have beneficial result have see that myself in prison where have meet both the people who run such service and the people receive they the hon lady be therefore right however be really speak about something more fundamental than that which be willingness to recognise as the hon lady do by the way in her brief intervention that punishment matter the reticence or unwillingness to declare that as openly as have or the attempt to ignore or avoid it be at odd with the instinct of the vast majority of our constituent it be perhaps product of society that have lose its moral compass where right and wrong have be erode through kind of moral relativism perhaps it be because of some quasi freudian need to explain crime in more complex term than it may warrant for it be simply question of someone want something they can not get and use force violence or some other mean to get it the right hon gentleman be make passionate and principled speech about punishment but we be deal here with practicality the public accounts committee of which be member have look at the prison estate capacity there be pledge under the previous government for additional prison place just of those be actually build if the right hon gentleman be to pursue this line of say that everybody need to have punishment without rehabilitation do not understand where in practical term he be go to put people agree with the hon lady actually remember visit the former justice secretary the former member for cheltenham alex chalk with my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman to tell he that we would not vote for it if that government bring forward measure to let people out early my position on this matter have be entirely consistent would not have vote for conservative measure that let people out of prison early any more than will vote for this measure tonight suggest three thing to the then justice secretary first that we deal more robustly with foreign national offender again our constituent would be astound and appal if they realise just how many foreign national offender be in our prison secondly suggest take emergency measure to provide prison place after all during covid we build nightingale hospital suggest that we build fry prison name after the tory prison reformer elizabeth fry which will not be lose on the historian here in the chamber do not see why that could not be do thirdly we should certainly explore prison that have be close in recent time under conservative and labour governments and see which could be use either temporarily or on permanent basis there be whole range of measure that we could take it be not easy and say that know what it be like be government minister none of those thing be easy but they be all worthy of further exploration because of the effect that the legislation will have say would talk about the effect of the measure which be that very large number of people will be release from prison the figure be alarming we could see over people release early we could see thousand of violent offender release appreciate that they be release on licence and that measure can be take through the probation service and the police to try to limit the harm they might do but the reality be that there have already be increase in recall my estimation would go as far as to call it prediction be that that number will rise if we pass the bill think recall will soar and the police and probation service will struggle to deal with that as my hon friend the shadow minister predict would not be surprised if the minister come back to the house with an amendment to this legislation to deal with that emergency for that be what it will become it will be profound emergency for people affect by those who be release and commit crime again because they will not all be petty offence my right hon friend talk about the number of people who will be release from prison speak early about the number of people who will not even be go to prison all in all it will be ten of thousand of people not in prison do my right hon friend agree that when the public find this out they will want that government go as my right hon friend say with her typical clarity and passion it may be that the government bow to public pressure and there will undoubtedly be public pressure of kind she describe we be speak about people who have do serious harm include sex offender of the most extreme kind and violent repeat offender these be not people who have commit minor indiscretion they be very serious criminal the public will resist their release and protest about it and the minister may well feel oblige as be sure he be man of principle to return to the house and amend the legislation when its effect be truly and fully see my judgment would be that the fact speak for themselves thousand of people will be let out of prison who certainly should not be the reason be as describe they they be practical but there be an underlying sentiment that try to articulate it be fear of punishment and an unwillingness to recognise the retributive nature of criminal justice as my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey set out far more eloquently than ever could the effect be likely to be devastating for our constituent and community across the country and bear in mind that it will happen in every part of this country every constituency will suffer as result of the legislation each one of we will as good constituency mp have to cope with some of these effect the alternative be as describe when respond to an early intervention to look at every possible mean of accommodate people in prison who deserve to be incarcerate rise be come to my exciting finale but will happy give way on the way to it thank the hon member for give way do he agree with his hon friend the member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman that the conservative government record on prison building be shameful the former minister for common sense the hon member for tatton esther mcvey have be nod along when member have say that we need to build more prison it certainly sound like common sense but why on earth do the conservative government not do that on purely technical point be right hon and so be my right hon friend the members for tatton and for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman but let we put that to one side it be matter of public record that almost never disagree with my right hon friend the member for fareham and waterlooville the truth be she be right we should have build more prison much early we could have anticipate these thing they can be model after all by the way government be often surprisingly poor at modelling see that throughout my time in government but we should have model this give the trend change in the prison population it might be helpful to give some of the number three prison be build with place they be delay because of lockdown and another three prison be on the way note those figure early my right hon friend be right we also rarely disagree and do not disagree with word she say early that more prison place be add but there be two thing about that what we do not really take necessary account of be the effect of sentence policy if more people be sentence to incarceration perfectly properly that change the trend we certainly could have deal more effectively with foreign national offender than we do which be another grow problem furthermore over long period of time while we be add place we take some prison place out we need to think about the number of prison that close she be therefore right interruption it be not that we do nothing far from it we do many good thing of the kind she describe but unfortunately not enough account be take over long enough period it be not largely about the immediate policy of the previous government it go back much far than that to series of government of both major party over long time indeed the modelling that describe be decade long modelling it be an extremely difficult business to get planning permission to build prison the last government often struggle with resistance to have prison build or expand in locality it be usually local constituency mp we can imagine such people liberal democrat type who come here and say one notice that say type rather than just liberal democrats they say one thing but go back to their constituency and campaign against open prison rise with that give way to the hon gentleman say to the right hon gentleman and many hon member that the prison population be supply lead industry if we build more prison we will just get more prisoner it do not address the issue all history tell we that look at america we imprison more people in this country than be do in europe yet we have high rate of criminality more people be imprison in america than here yet america have high rate of criminality building prison be fool errand the thing that most admire about the hon gentleman be his sartorial style glance across towards he early and be go to say to he as leave the chamber love your rarely agree with what he say we come from very different perspective in sense do not mean to be unkind his view be part of the problem the problem be the persistent idea that put people in prison be cruel and nasty of course it be pretty nasty and most of our constituent think it should be in fact they probably think it should be nasty than it be our difference of opinion will never be reconcile in few brief exchange but it be important to note that range of sentence be available to the court not just prison and the key thing about which be sure we agree be that those sentence need to be fitting to the event fit to the effect of the crime and fitting to the interest of the victim as my hon friend the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty say in move his new clause thank the right hon gentleman for his sartorial appreciation some time ago of my green suit when he go on to ask whether win it at village fête and do you do not but maybe the right hon gentleman can agree on the point that want to make he speak about the challenge that government have have when modelling prisoner number and the prison population do he therefore agree with david gauke who recommend in his report that there should be an independent body that do that modelling and be he disappoint that there be not feature of that in the bill no do not congratulate the hon gentleman on use the word appreciate exactly as in its dictionary definition do appreciate his sartorial style but that be not to say that either admire or approve it laughter in respect of david gauke who be former colleague and be commission to produce that report do not agree in essence with it be more inclined to agree with the analysis of the shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick and my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle there be huge mistake in assume that incarceration be not of itself beneficial to deal with the simple issue of recidivism people can not do harm when they be lock up by far the good and most straightforward way of deal with recidivism be to take people out of harm way and by that mean take they out of do harm if someone have commit very serious crime such as rape murder or very violent assault lock they up mean they will not do it again release they mean too often that they will the statistic speak for themselves if the government want to really deal with recidivism they should do three thing increase the number of whole life sentence raise the minimum sentence for whole range of crime and raise maximum sentence to do that they have to build more prison the mission give to the government be that they jettison the bill before it do harm think about how they can devise and deliver alternative to that and be bold in make case for retributive system of criminal justice in way that so few people have for so long as member of the justice committee it be privilege to speak in support of the bill welcome the much need reform that it will bring to our court and prison system wish to speak in support of clause and amendment relate to sentence of month or less table by my hon friend the member for colchester pam cox we be well aware in this house of the disastrous situation our prison system be leave in by the previous government and be proud that this government be now confront the crisis head on we be committed to not just short term fix but long term reform the bill will tackle the root cause of the issue that lead to the crisis in the first place and rebuild justice system that deliver fairness safety and accountability to all in society amendment will do more than just reduce the pressure on our prison system it will represent vital cultural shift place rehabilitation and reintegration at the heart of our sentencing system since become an mp have visit several prison and one thing that have become clear be how easy it be to fall into the reoffende cycle especially for those who be serve short sentence minor offence can lead to short prison sentence that can affect prisoner entire life they leave prison and they have no home no connection and no job when they be release from prison they have no option but to fall back into the same behaviour that put they in prison in the first place we have already hear this afternoon that of offender in prison be reoffender the prison environment can have hugely detrimental effect on prisoner we know for example that last year there be one prison where of the prisoner develop drug problem only after enter custody these prisoner be strip of have second chance the whole house agree early this afternoon that everyone deserve second chance but our justice system be compound the very problem it be try to solve yes justice be about punishment and retribution but let we be clear it be not just about punishment it be not just about build as many prison as possible our focus in the justice system must also be on prevent further harm and support rehabilitation programme to enable people to build well life and help they to make the right choice the suspend sentencing and community sentencing recommend by the amendment will help our court to focus on what work they will not only help to reduce prison overcrowding but provide an overall net benefit to our society community sentence allow offender to access mental health or addiction support while continue to maintain their life so that they can get rehabilitation and reintegrate back into society as responsible citizen the financial case be equally compelling reoffende be estimate to cost over billion every year and it cost the taxpayer over to imprison just one person for single year if we break the cycle we can redirect those resource to our crucial public service agree that victim protection must be at the heart of all decision make in the justice system and be glad that while the bill introduce presumption to suspend short custodial sentence of month or less this be simply presumption which mean that judge will always have the option and the power to send dangerous offender or prolific lawbreaker to prison furthermore the presumption will not apply where an offender have breach court order include in the case of any violence against woman or girl or related protective order where the offender have reoffende in breach of previous suspend sentence where the prisoner pose significant risk of physical or psychological harm to an individual or where there be clear risk to public safety my hon friend be make powerful point about amendment it be imperative that when we look at improve the system as whole we understand the pressure that we be place on our court include snaresbrook criminal court in my constituency do he agree that it be imperative that this should be facet of all the change we hope to bring about have visit snaresbrook crown court and understand exactly what my hon friend be say he make valid point the pressure on our court system and our prison system be all interlink it be important that victim get the justice they deserve that the court be able to deliver it and that offender rehabilitation do not come at the cost of victim confidence however we must recognise that short term prison sentence all too often do not work and instead merely cause disruption to people life and kick start cycle of reoffende where the court believe that justice be well serve through community rehabilitation we must empower they to do put that in place amendment would require judge also to consider whether community sentence be well than prison sentence or suspend prison sentence be proud to support this bill because it centre on victim and allow they the protection and dignity that they deserve the bill and the amendment will also allow those on trial proper consideration for rehabilitation and an opportunity to make amend and have well life urge member to support clause to support amendment and to support the bill it be vital and crucial step forward for our court our prison and our community and for fair justice system that work for all government new clause seek to strengthen the deportation framework by make it available to those give suspend sentence urge the house to pause before we simply nod it through it may be politically attractive to say that we be toughen deportation power but in practice the change risk blur the distinction between the offender who pose genuine threat to the public and those who do not suspend sentence be impose precisely where the court believe that immediate custody be not necessary for justice or public safety to treat those individual like those who have serve time in prison lack logic and may well invite legal challenge my concern be that we be legislate in haste as see in today committee of the whole house and layer new power on system that already fail to use effectively those that it already have instead of focus on headline grab amendment we should be fix the operational chaos in the home office that allow people to slip through the crack in the first place as we have see in my constituency the notorious wimbledon prowler have recently be release but not deport despite the home office vow to deport he when he be send down in what assessment have the government make of the likely number of offender who will be deport under the expand definition and how will the home office ensure that deportation decision make under the broad power remain compliant with article right and do not clog up the court with appeal that could delay the removal of genuinely dangerous offender be go to speak in favour of government new clause but first want to take the opportunity to mention the conservatives party record in government lot have be make during this debate about the prison that be build during the last government so let we place it on record that between and there be net addition of prison place if that be record that the conservatives be proud to stand on will happily give it to they secondly lot have be say about lefty lawyer would like to draw to the chamber attention that almost two year ago to the day the then conservative lord chancellor presumably well know lefty lawyer speak about suspend sentence of reoffende rate he say the fact be that more than of people who leave prison after serve less than month go on to commit further crime however the figure for those who be on suspend sentence order with condition be report october vol it be important that we understand what we be talk about when we be talk about suspend sentence that point be relevant to the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler as well do try to explain that there be difference between association and causality the hon member be compare two different cohort if she be to match the cohort properly the difference in reoffende rate be nothing like that it be more like or think the hon gentleman be make correction to the former lord chancellor because those be his word be sorry that the conservative party have move so far in two year that you wish to disown the work of lord chancellor who stand in this chamber just two year ago ms minns wish to disown be not contribute to the debate really do apologise ms ghani move on support new clause it would strengthen our approach to the deportation of foreign criminal by amend the definition of period of imprisonment in two key piece of legislation the uk borders act and the nationality immigration and asylum act the amendment be about ensure that the law reflect the seriousness of the sentence hand down by the court whether it be immediate or suspend currently suspend sentence of month or more do not count towards the definition of foreign criminal for deportation purpose this create loophole that risk undermine confidence in our immigration and justice system have meet the minister for border security and asylum to discuss the deportation of foreign criminal with suspend sentence and very much welcome the closure of this loophole it be not an abstract policy change it be necessary correction to real and press issue new clause ensure that suspend sentence of month or more be treat with the gravity they deserve when consider deportation it send clear message that serious criminal behaviour will not be overlook simply because the sentence be suspend and it strengthen our ability to protect community uphold justice and maintain public confidence in our immigration system let we be clear suspend sentence be still sentence of imprisonment it be impose by judge who have determine that the offence be serious enough to warrant custody the fact that the sentence be suspend do not diminish the gravity of the crime do the hon lady not accept that most victim of crime would say that suspend sentence be very much not custodial sentence it be nevertheless suspend sentence by pass new clause we be say that serious offence whether the sentence be serve behind bar or under condition in the community carry consequence include the possibility of removal from the uk could the hon lady tell we why judge would suspend the sentence be not go to pretend to be an expert in the judiciary or the action of individual judge nevertheless it be important that we recognise that suspend sentence and sentence that place an individual in prison be both sentence of punishment we be talk in our discussion on new clause about how that relate to whether foreign criminal should be remove from the country the new clause be targeted proportionate and principled amendment it do not expand the scope of deportation arbitrarily it simply ensure that those who commit serious crime be not shield from deportation by technicality urge colleague from across the house to support it the gauke review be thorough exercise carry out in good faith it be intend to fix some of the problem that persist in the justice system and be particularly aim at ease the burden on the prison estate as member of the justice committee have the opportunity to question the former lord chancellor and be strike by his thoughtfulness and expertise despite that do have reservation about part of the bill particularly those around the early release of certain prisoner amendment table by my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle dr mullan seek to add an extra protection to the bill to combat this it would ensure that the most violent and dangerous offender those guilty of crime like rape grievous bodily harm child sex abuse and cause death by dangerous driving do not benefit from automatic sentence reduction we all agree that rehabilitation have place in our justice system but that be not its only purpose the public expect criminal to be punish for their wrongdoing and to be protect from those criminal cause future harm fear that labour member do not know the consequence of the bill which be that violent and sexual offender will be release from prison early and will then go on to commit further criminal offence we will have to deal with those consequence in the year to come if the bill be pass unamended those who commit the most serious crime should serve the full sentence hand down by our court early release should never be reward for those who have shatter life beyond repair ben and amy branson live in my constituency in their daughter bethany be kill by drunk driver who then flee the scene when arrest shortly afterwards he admit his guilt and say hope kill someone oh well you know what will get three four five year hopefully kill they this person have already receive one third discount on his sentence for plead guilty can any member of this house say that it would be just for his sentence to be reduce even far this amendment protect trust in justice it ensure that victim and their family be not force to see their attacker walk free halfway through their sentence it send clear message if you commit crime of sexual violence if you abuse child or if you cause grievous harm or death you will face the consequence of your action we owe that to victim and we owe it to community who need to know that the justice system be on their side also support new clause table by my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle which would introduce clear and practical duty to collect and publish sentencing datum include information about nationality visa route and asylum status within hour of sentencing this measure be about transparency accuracy and trust at present we simply do not have full picture of who be commit offence in our country without reliable datum we can not make informed policy decision on border control integration or criminal justice collect this information will allow parliament and the public to see whether our system for manage migration and visa be work as intend it will also help to identify genuine issue and give the government the evidence need to respond proportionately and effectively we already collect detailed datum on age gender and offence type add nationality and immigration status be logical next step it will help policymaker target resource where they be most need while maintain the fairness and integrity of our justice system we have all see how quickly rumour spread online about the background or immigration status of offender in serious case the good way to combat that be more transparency this will protect the police and the wide system from accusation of complicity in cover up sunlight be the good disinfectant both amendment have speak in favour of today would serve to increase trust in the justice system encourage colleague from all party to consider what they can do to repair the confidence that have be damage in the last year would like to speak in favour of my new clause as well as new clause and fourteen year of tory austerity have leave prison in crisis they be severely overcrowded and understaffed there be significant challenge on the prison estate include staffing shortage hmp liverpool expect to see massive reduction in staffing due to the impact of the skilled worker visa scheme prison be force to take emergency release measure to prevent complete system breakdown there be much to appreciate in this bill and more to wait for from the law commission sentencing review but echo the concern raise without sufficient resourcing and transparent clear guidance the ambition of the bill risk fail we know that over half of those serve sentence of less than month reoffend and woman prisoner disproportionately receive short sentence the link between short sentence and reoffende contribute greatly to the pressure on prison capacity mental health treatment alcohol and drug misuse treatment and other rehabilitative service bring wide social benefit and protect the public far well than the current system by tackle the cause of crime the organisation justice have state that without proper resourcing staffing and funding rehabilitative service will remain too overstretched to be effective in august shortfall of probation service staff be record the bill impact assessment estimate the need for an additional probation staff each year will the minister reassure member that he understand the scale of the task ahead and outline his commitment to allocate adequate resource to ensure that our frontline service can deliver the provision and vision of the bill new clause table by the hon member for guildford zöe franklin seek to provide leave to appeal where there have be change in the law that be material to the conviction and where the application be serve before the conviction be spend version of the new clause be first move by the former mp for huddersfield my predecessor as chair of the all party group for miscarriage of justice it be write by charlotte henry formidable campaigner for joint enterprise not guilty by association have long campaign against the abuse of joint enterprise legal doctrine and take this opportunity to recognise the fantastic work undertake by jengba over the past year the justice secretary previously provide commitment to jengba and hope that he will support new clause today my new clause seek to provide oversight mechanism for electronic monitoring which the bill propose increase hugely the plan be to create prison outside prison but although that have potential to ease the overcrowding crisis on the estate it could give rise to significant risk without proper oversight and accountability tagging play an important part in our criminal justice system and if use correctly and ethically it can help reduce crime and protect the public while give victim confidence that justice be be serve however there be numerous problem and those must be address before any further expansion particularly the massive profit make by private sector company we must analyse the purpose of tagging from public protection to be punishment in itself the bill expand power to ban offender from specific place or certain activity even when those have no connection with the offence that be one glare example of where tag technology risk lead to great unchecked restriction on our liberty fail private sector contract be at the heart of the problem particularly those with serco and now acquire by allied universal which have murky and well document history of over charge and under delivering and which have be fin ten of million of pound as result agree with the secondary legislation scrutiny committee in the other place which last year say it be remarkable that serco and have be reappointe to provide tagging service after they have be investigate by the serious fraud office and subject to fine for misconduct and deferred prosecution agreement the issue be not only money we be give those company more and more control of sensitive and clearly transformational criminal justice technology instead we should use this decisive moment to bring tag firmly into the public sector probation service as be common in the rest of europe and out of the hand of fail and fraudulent privateer the government have promise the big insourcing in generation and if they fail to insource these service they should consider demand by the union to make the company that make and provide the tag also fit the tag pre release that be in my new clause remind member of the appalling case of gaie delap just stop oil activist in her late who spend extra week in prison because serco could not find tag to fit she the company make million from these contract should be sanction so that they deliver service correctly they should not be allow to rely on overstretch prison staff to pick up their work will the minister assure the house on that point the fragmented privatised system create huge delay and inefficiency and provide financial challenge for the people whom it supervise who for example have to charge tag without have access to electricity or money to pay for it support new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter which call for an annual report detail the use of tagging and include information on the number of tag fit the number of malfunctioning device the rate of compliance and the cost of administrate the system that important datum must be freely available if the public and union be to have any confidence in electronic monitoring justice union and the frontline worker whom they represent be call for great oversight accountability and transparency in monitor performance and for any failure to be address immediately not cover up by profit hungry corporation join they in call on the government to commit to full review of the feasibility of all tagging be manage by the probation service in the future in system run for public good not private profit in keep with our promise to oversee the great wave of insource for generation now be the time for this labour government to bring this increasingly vital public service fully into the public sector where it belong so ask hon member to support my amendment congratulate the hon member for wolverhampton west warinder juss on his clear and comprehensive explanation of the flaw of short sentence the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who be no long in his place give we some insight into why we have end up in such mess government modelling be not able to reconcile the removal of prison place with rule for increase sentence the result be more demand for prison place the net figure of prison place gain since give by the hon member for carlisle ms minns show the utterly damn mistake that be make during the conservatives time in government will speak in favour of new clause and in christmas lillie clack family be wake by police inform they that lillie have be involve in traffic accident on christmas morning it be cause by driver under the influence who be speed at up to mph and who fail to stop for the police follow the accident heroic local resident rush to the scene with fire extinguisher but sadly lillie die in hospital three day later lillie family have campaign tirelessly since then for lillie law which would result in licence be suspend immediately upon charge and lifetime ban from drive when driver be convict of cause death by dangerous driving or by careless driving speak in favour of new clause table by the hon and gallant member for huntingdon ben obese jecty which would apply the lifetime ban and in favour of new clause table by my hon friend the member for chichester jess brown fuller on the suspension of person drive licence while they be on bail for driving relate offence together those new clause would deliver the objective of lillie law and provide both punishment and deterrent for those who step into car under the influence or who do not take the care that be require when drive which be privilege and not right will speak briefly in favour of new clause encourage hon member from across the house to support the long overdue resentencing of all prisoner currently hold under sentence of imprisonment for public protection at the end of more than people be hold under an ipp which be an ongoing scandal and tragedy for those individual the government claim that the jail term be grave injustice but they be fail to move quickly enough this new clause would force they to act as the hon member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter so clearly explain there be need for action so hope his colleague can be persuade to support new clause in the absence of another measure to address the issue which be badly require finally will mention new clause on the provision of training during the period when an individual be on remand we must enable rehabilitation wherever possible even if the new clause be not take forward today join colleague and the hon member for congleton sarah russell in encourage the government to look at the current situation justice must be capable of learn from its mistake when the law evolve it must reach back for those leave behind that be the principle behind new clause and which table the new clause would create fair route for people still serve sentence under law that have since be abolish or where the legal basis have materially change they would allow court to review such case so that punishment reflect the law as it stand today not as it stand decade ago at present there be no clear mechanism for that to happen even when parliament or the court have recognise that law be wrong those affect have no way to benefit our system can acknowledge injustice but it can not yet fix it we see that most clearly in the case of alex henry whose sister be my constituent she have campaign tirelessly on this issue and she and alex mum be in the gallery today some year ago alex be convict of murder after second altercation he do not wield the weapon he throw phone and one punch then run he be convict under the now discredit doctrine of joint enterprise which allow jury to convict if defendant merely foresaw what someone else might do two year later the supreme court rule that that interpretation have be wrong for more than year foresight be not enough for guilt intent must be present yet alex remain in prison serve life sentence with minimum term of year for crime that he would not have be convict of under today law alex mother sally be constituent of mine in esher and walton she share alex story in one of my surgery so be very pleased that his story be be consider today in parliament the new clause put forward by my hon friend will help to ensure that people such as alex have route to justice sally be battle on behalf of her son against law that be obsolete all of we can only imagine how heartbreaking and frustrating that be and the unfairness of what my hon friend have describe urge member across the committee to support the new clause so that there be course to justice this be indeed highly significant issue which be why have put forward the new clause since his conviction alex have be diagnose with autism condition that fundamentally affect how he perceive and react to social situation that diagnosis raise serious question about whether it be even fair to suggest that he could have foresee friend violent act let alone intend it alex story be not unique many other overwhelmingly young man disproportionately from minority ethnic background remain imprison under doctrine that our high court have disown recognise today joint enterprise not guilty by association jengba whose member have work tirelessly for more than decade to support family and campaign for reform many of they and the family of those affect be also here in the gallery place on record my gratitude for their courage and persistence in seek justice also thank the hon member for liverpool riverside kim johnson for her support this afternoon new clause would allow people still serve sentence under law that have materially change to apply for review it would give court discretion to resentence in line with the law as it now stand or to make any other order necessary in the interest of justice this be not about reopen every case or grant automatic release it be about restore fairness new clause would complement that by require the secretary of state for justice to review and report to parliament on how change in criminal law affect exist conviction and sentence it would ensure that when the law evolve we look back and ask what the change mean for the people already affect this be not just moral necessity but practical one we face severe crisis in our prison which be overcrowded understaffed and at break point it make no sense to fill cell with people serve sentence under law that no long reflect justice while those who genuinely threaten public safety wait for space we need prison place for those who be truly dangerous not for those who be simply in the wrong place at the wrong time under the wrong law the secretary of state for justice have long recognise the injustice of joint enterprise in he call it shoddy law outdated and backward and pledge to change it family across the country include many in the gallery remember that promise today bill give the secretary of state and the government the chance to make good on it the new clause provide practical proportionate and fair way to ensure that our justice system can correct itself when the law get it wrong as such my ask today be for the secretary of state and the government to champion these clause from the government benches work with and campaigner to refine the detail if need but do not let the principle fall away because the strength of our justice system lie not in its perfection but in its capacity to put right its own mistake for alex henry for the family in the gallery today and for everyone who be still serve sentence under law that our court have already reject urge all member on both side of the committee and the government to support new clause and begin by thank all those who have contribute to this important debate about sentencing policy and the future of our criminal justice system before turn to the specific of various amendment there be two overarching principle that inform this piece of legislation and the government position today the first be the legacy that this government inherit from the conservative party with prison at break point the risk that the most serious offender would avoid arrest or custody altogether and the need for emergency action to release offender early to avoid the prison system collapse that be the conclusion of year of tory failure alongside the large prison building programme since the victorian era this sentencing bill fix that mess under this government never again secondly while we stabilise the system that be so shamefully vandalise by the previous tory government we can build well justice system one that protect the public and reduce reoffende this government will prioritise punishment but punishment that work not the broken system we have today that be why we be introduce important measure on short custodial sentence which robust evidence show will reduce offending save the taxpayer money and assist with the prison capacity crisis fix the mess we inherit and build more robust and effective justice system be at the heart of today bill turn to the amendment table by the official opposition and the shadow justice team be simply aghast at the chutzpah of the conservative party on justice issue the piece of legislation we be consider be only before the committee today because of the mess that the tories leave behind whereas they turn their back on the mount crisis this government will not shrink from the challenge we face however difficult they may be amendment would undermine central purpose of the legislation which be to solve the tory prison capacity crisis let be absolutely clear what victim of crime and our community fear the most be the situation the tories leave behind in which criminal murderer rapist and child abuser might not face prison at all because the tories leave our system teeter on the brink without the capacity to lock up even the most serious offender we will not apologise for the measure in this bill that clear up their mess the inspiration for the change that the tories oppose be the earn progression model from texas where crime have be slash by improve rehabilitation and cut reoffende tackle reoffende and boost effort to rehabilitate offender use to be conservative policy indeed the shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick who be not in his normal place use to believe in rehabilitation and initiative to cut reoffende eight year ago when think he be still one nation cameroon he argue that the statutory definition of the purpose of prison should include rehabilitation and report july vol now he oppose every single measure in this bill that further that cause he be moderate now he be pound shop populist one wonder whether he believe in anything other than his campaign to become leader of the opposition simply not serious madam chair the minister have describe what be in the bill as an earn progression model have read out to the committee the independent library briefing note which say that progression will not be earn it will be automatic on what basis be the minister continue to describe it as an earn model within the sentencing bill and primary legislation be specific punishment for offender who do not play by the rule while they be in prison that will affect the earn progression model further detail about exactly how one can gain credit will be deliver in due course the opposition and the hon member for clacton nigel farage have table amendment to the provision on the sentencing council with the aim of abolish the council and the tory amendment would transfer its function to the secretary of state for justice that would amount to constitutional vandalism it be an attempt to undermine the independence of the judiciary the sentencing council hold pivotal role as bridge between parliament and the judiciary the council be widely acknowledge to have bring great consistency to the sentencing process even before the council creation it be not for the justice secretary or lord chancellor to fulfil the function of create these guideline it be right that the council be hold to account by parliament but it would be offensive to the principle of the separation of power to dissolve the council entirely this be classic case of the populist go too far and not reaffirm the sovereignty of this place as clause and successfully achieve but trash constitutional norm for media headline urge the committee to reject such performative politic the shadow minister the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan table new clause on the unduly lenient sentence scheme on which the hon member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson make powerful speech while the government understand that the day time limit can be difficult for victim and their family it be important that there be finality in sentencing and that we avoid ongoing uncertainty about the sentence to be serve the law commission be undertake review of criminal appeal and hold public consultation inviting view on range of reform to the unduly lenient sentence scheme include extend the time limit we will wait for the law commission response before respond have hear the point that member have make about communication and over the come week will look at change we can make to process and function within the ministry of justice to improve the system shall move on to short sentence and the amendment table by the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey want to be clear about this because her speech simply do not accept the reality clause do not ban short custodial sentence at the end of this parliament there will be more offender in jail than there have ever be before that be not be soft on crime there be an important exemption in the legislation for case where there be significant risk of harm to particular individual whether psychological or physical it will always be up to the court to decide how to apply the presumption in any give case the right hon lady amendment to widen the scope of the exemption or to eat away at the month definition of short sentence would render the provision meaningless it be not the right direction the provision also include an exemption for breach of court order we have strengthen that far with government amendment and which clarify that it include repeat offender who commit further offence while on suspend sentence government amendment and far expand the scope of the exemption so that it apply where an offence have be commit in circumstance that be closely connect to the breach of court order even where the breach be not in and of itself criminal offence together those amendment ensure that repeat offender will not benefit from the presumption when they be already subject to court order where we can do so safely we should be move away from short term sentence put people in prison for few week cost the taxpayer huge amount and lead to far reoffende we know that reoffende rate among those serve short term sentence be scandalously high rigorous research show that equivalent sentence in the community will tackle reoffende prevent thousand of crime each year indeed the rigorous research which the shadow minister cite show that these measure will cut crime be commission by the last conservative government they even put this precise provision copy and paste in legislation that they introduce prior to the election but it never come before parliament the conservatives know it be the right thing to do but now they oppose it for opposition sake it be good example of how far they have fall they be simply not serious will not be able to speak to all the various amendment table by the chair of the justice committee my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter as be sure he will appreciate meet he early this week and will no doubt meet he and member of the committee in the week ahead be grateful to he and his committee for their work new clause address the important issue of the imprisonment for public protection sentence it be right that the ipp sentence be abolish and the government be determined to support those in prison to progress towards safe and sustainable release but not in way that undermine public protection change we have implement through the ipp action plan have contribute to fall of around in the number of unreleased ipp prisoner between june and june recognise the chair desire to see the previous justice committee recommendation on resentencing implement but despite its detailed consideration of the issue the committee like various other organisation be unable to identify an approach to resentence that would not involve release offender whom the parole board have determine pose too great risk to the public the chair of the committee have put forward other amendment to the ipp scheme relate to the review of licence condition the government will look into that over the come day and week and no doubt have conversation with he let say little about new clause which deal with tagging an issue that be also raise by the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde the government agree that it be important to report on key metric relate to electronic monitoring which be why the ministry of justice publish statistical report on the use of electronic monitoring in england and wales both quarterly and annually our next annual report which we expect to be publish next summer will include detail on key performance indicator that the department use to hold the electronic monitoring provider to account as the hon gentleman will know owe to commercial sensitivity be unable to specify the fine that have be enforce on those private company relate to the tagging system but we will continue to hold their foot to the fire which hope will reassure he understand and sympathise with the aim of amendment and and new clause which discuss yesterday with my hon friend the member for lowestoft jess asato who make characteristically powerful speech and other as one who spend many year represent victim of domestic violence in court before enter this place know full well the importance of rigorous risk assessment in such case however the government believe that the current measure be sufficient long recall period to ensure that assessment be full and protective measure can be take and the domestic abuse identifi key reform that will well enable safeguard service to remain alert to threat pose by perpetrator it have be great to work with ministers at the ministry of justice and to help drive that identifier forward will the minister join in celebrate the incredible bravery of itv loose women many of whom through their face it together campaign have speak out about their experience of domestic abuse and will he or fellow minister from the moj come and meet they next wednesday from pm onwards in the attlee suite where shall be host they and we will be bring the face it together campaign to parliament be always happy to pay tribute to the brilliant loose women and diary permit will be there at pm with the hon gentleman their campaign have be serious and have have real effect and we be very grateful to they offender who pose great risk be already exclude from the measure in the bill include those recall on account of be charge with further offence such as importantly an offence relate to breach of civil domestic violence protection order and those subject to multi agency supervision level and which apply to many sexual violence and domestic abuse offender these offender can only receive standard recall new clause table by the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson build on the work of the hon member for eastbourne it would require the court to treat any offence involve domestic abuse as aggravate again recognise and sympathise with the intent behind the new clause but domestic abuse be already treat as an aggravating factor in sentencing through the guideline that make it clear that judge should consider domestic abuse as increase the seriousness of an offence allow for tough sentence where appropriate we believe that any change might complicate the sentencing framework unnecessarily without any real practical benefit let now deal with the issue of drive offence we have hear many powerful speech include one from the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty who also make powerful speech on second reading he be not currently in the chamber oh he be here but he have change and be look very dapper have have brief conversation with he about some of his proposal while we do not support the mandatory ban for careless and dangerous driving that result in death be determined to look at it along with my colleague at the department for transport be shock by some of the statistic that the hon gentleman and my hon friend the member for west bromwich sarah coombes produce on second reading and in meeting that have have with they since then want to get into the detail but there be certainly more that we can do and know that other member have raise important case in this connection will be look at measure that we can take to strengthen driving ban on an interim and permanent basis for the most reckless offender again praise all the member who have make such powerful speech today some of they on behalf of constituent who have suffer significant tragedy new clause and be table by my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south dr gardner have meet she twice to discuss the new clause and the policy aim that sit behind they commend she for table they raise the importance of tackle the hidden harm of problematic gambling and for her ongoing collaboration on this topic let briefly explain the way in which we already identify and support those with gambling issue and how we be seek to increase the support that we provide pre sentencing report help the court to identify underlie issue such as harmful gambling mental health problem and addiction which may influence offend behaviour mental health condition and addiction can be take into account at sentencing and court be encourage to take an individualised approach particularly when the condition contribute to the offending where individual demonstrate commitment to address those issue court may consider community sentence treatment requirement and in particular mental health treatment requirement as part of community or suspend sentence order this can be undertake only with the consent of the individual and new clause as draft by my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south provide for the treatment to be mandatory which be an issue as have discuss with she there be the issue of the scale of demand and the current lack of any reliable datum on how this would look in the criminal justice system that be why have already commit to work with colleague at the department of health and social care indeed have be in correspondence with they just this week to ensure that the ministry of justice be involve in the develop work on gambling addiction treatment and use of the statutory levy that be lead by the department for culture media and sport will briefly deal with new clause table by the hon member for clacton who do not bother to turn up for any of the debate his new clause would introduce automatic deportation for foreign national who be give sentence of at least six month although the state would be force to seek the deportation of an individual in such circumstance that individual would clearly have cause for challenge not just on echr ground but in particular on the ground of judicial review and proportionality which have be long hold principle of common law in this country for hundred of year let be clear this government be urgently remove foreign national offender with removal up by since we come into office through government new clause we be extend the home secretary duty to deport under the uk borders act to foreign national who be give suspend sentence of at least month uphold our value and keep our nation safe be priority and new clause send clear message regardless of whether court choose to impose an immediate custodial sentence or pass suspend sentence if the sentence be for period of at least month it be sufficiently serious to merit automatic deportation new clause table by reform would make mockery of our effort more generally put scant resource into needless litigation and often unnecessary deportation another reform policy that crash and burn on contact with reality will briefly speak about new clause and the powerful story tell by my hon friend the member for south shields emma lewell about her constituent sophie it be an issue that first come across my desk as part of preparation for committee although the government be absolutely determined to deport foreign offender for serious offence the risk assessment in her new clause may inhibit the government effort in that regard this be something that will look at very closely in the come week and hope that can have meeting with my hon friend to discuss the detail and how we can make it work want to raise briefly the campaign by my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin on tool theft which have be such an important part of the reform to the sentencing and criminal justice policy her effort have be successful today debate which have last nearly four hour show that the dividing line in british politic be increasingly clear it be between those who recognise the tough choice face our country and be willing to make they in order to clean up the mess leave behind by the last tory government and the unserious populist opposition carping from the sideline be sure the minister will hope that back benchers have listen closely to what he have say but more important be what he have not say the government have be brief journalist that what we be say about rapist and paedophile get out early be not true and they have tell the same to number of labour back benchers to be clear can the minister put on the record whether any rapist or paedophile serve standard determinate sentence will be release early as result of this bill yes or no as the hon gentleman know sentence decision be for the judiciary every single offence in his amendment can be give an extended determinate sentence as have say before will say it again what victim of crime fear the most be the situation that this government inherit in which we be run out of prison place and the most serious offender might not have face prison at all bizarrely the shadow justice minister say early in the debate if have be prime minister or chancellor this would have happen well you be not be afraid lot of you lot have go at be chancellor or prime minister and none of you do good job order you lot and you be address to madam chair do not think that you be prime minister or chancellor do apologise the tory legacy in our prison be lawless disorder with not enough prison place to arrest or lock up even the most serious offender the conservatives howl opposition today ring hollow in the context of their disastrous legacy this government have take action to fix the mess by deliver prison place in the first year compare with over year of conservative misrule but we can not simply build our way out of this crisis it require long term reform for more sustainable system this bill ensure that we will never again face the impossible situation that we face last summer but it go far it mean we will cut reoffende rate and we will build prison that produce well citizen not well criminal this bill will help keep our street and community safe thank all those who have contribute to the debate be deeply dismay by what the minister have to say this bill will make the street of our country less safe it will both let thousand of criminal out of prison and stop thousand of criminal go to prison it will have devastating impact on society if the minister be honest and be be truthful about this be an apologise not truthful if he be be accurate and the reason really be that there be an emergency because of lack of prison place why have he not accept my new clause that sunset clause would allow two year for three further prison initiate by the conservative government to come on line he have not do so because as think we have reveal or expose this government be soft on crime and they be on the side of the criminal not the victim shocking shocking actually be the word for this bill as the minister do not offer any way forward and have not agree to sunset clause will push my amendment to vote question

government to work with the national trust to keep wordsworth house fully operational and open to visitor and the petitioner remain etc social housing south cotswolds motion make and question propose that this house do now poynton be grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of social housing in the south cotswolds and thank the minister for be here this evening across our town and village from biddestone to barnsley and hullavington to hillesley the story be the same the need for genuinely affordable safe and well maintain housing have never be great yet precisely when the need be most acute the supply of such home be be allow to dwindle away in wiltshire today more than household wait on the council housing register family and individual be wait for secure affordable home many be in the high priority band recognise as be in significant need local parish survey tell the same story biddestone and slaughterford parish council have undertake two survey in recent year both confirm clear and continue demand for affordable housing there be also grow need among old resident for small adapt home so that they can downsize locally which will free up family house for the next generation yet in many village that option simply do not exist want to make it clear that be not advocate arbitrary housing target be talk about ensure that the right kind of home be build home that local family key worker and old resident can actually afford to live in and want to live in and home that have the infrastructure that they need while the government have set new national housing target that will more than double the number of home expect in area such as the cotswolds those figure risk do more harm than good if they ignore our local reality do my hon friend agree that scheme such as the new social housing in minehead the first social housing for generation couple with more social housing in mid devon specifically for elderly people to downsize from their own social housing be the way forward do she also agree that the liberal democrats in both institution should be recognise for do jolly good job that do indeed sound like an excellent idea commend the hon lady for bring forward this debate speak to she beforehand to get an idea of what she would be refer to we have debate in westminster hall this morning on homelessness and one point that come through very clearly be affordability house price can sometimes be over time the average of what people can afford from their earning in my constituency suspect it be the same in the hon lady many young people want to buy for the first time but can not get mortgage because the house be too expensive do the hon lady agree that to address the need of those who want to buy house or access social housing the government must build more house to bring the price down so that people can actually afford they agree with the hon member about the financial impact and even more so the social impact of young people not be able to afford their first home and fly the nest of their parent it be have catastrophic impact on young people return to the south cotswolds around of cotswold district lie within designate national landscape the cotswolds area of outstanding national beauty and of the remain roughly half be flood plain the hon lady be make an excellent speech and highlight perfectly the pressure on the landscape in southern england do she agree that there be great deal of scope in many town and even some large village for build on brownfield land in read there be number of example of this and be sure colleague have example from their own area brownfield could provide very valuable resource to help protect the countryside could not agree more that we should be prioritise brownfield site as well as refurbish exist housing we could very nearly if not completely meet the housing target through those mean without need to take space away from nature or food production impose target of over home year in the cotswold district may make good headline but in practice it encourage speculative development on greenfield site where service be often poor and flood risk high rather than genuinely affordable home for local people in more appropriate location but want to be clear that the debate be not about oppose new housing it be about ensure that what we build reflect local need protect our environment and natural heritage and strengthen our rural community rather than undermine they our infrastructure be already stretch thin many of our village have limit public transport age drainage system and gp surgery that be full to capacity broadband and mobile coverage remain unreliable in too many place and with climate change flood risk be rise with every winter storm we simply can not add hundred of new home without first ensure that the essential service of water drainage transport and healthcare can cope our infrastructure be fragile growth must be plan sensibly sympathetically and in logical order accord to local constraint not impose from the top down and literally bulldoze through these home must also be genuinely affordable over the year many local authority home have be transfer to housing association under large scale voluntary transfer in north wiltshire that happen back in those home now belong legally to the housing association not to the council but too many of those housing association be now sell off rural home rather than refurbish and retain they in some village every remain affordable home could be lose once they be sell into the private market they be go forever they will never again be available at social rent that result be devastating for rural community young people who grow up in these village find they can no long afford to live in they teacher carer and nurse be price out and old resident find nowhere to go when they want to downsize if we want our village to remain vibrant living community and not just be picture postcard backdrop we must ensure that people of all income can afford to live and work in they be grateful to my friend and constituency neighbour for give way she be speak with huge amount of common sense of course her problem in the south cotswolds be replicate in the north cotswolds the problem with increase the housing number double they from to year as she say be that the planning system be not deliver we the number of affordable house the developer will argue against build affordable housing because they can make more money out of executive three four or five bedroom house we need to alter the planning system so that developer through viability argument can not exclude the building of social housing in some case altogether thank my friend and neighbour for his intervention we do not agree on everything but we be definitely of like mind on this also defer to his experience as surveyor with great knowledge of the building industry moreover those who remain in the exist housing stock be too often live in condition that be simply unacceptable one of my constituent live in flat with her two daughter the eld daughter develop what be think to be asthma but doctor now believe that her breathing problem be cause by mould spore in their damp home she describe night spend in panic as her daughter cough uncontrollably the landlord response have be seasonal mould wash rather than proper fix that would get to the root cause of the mould problem some social housing provider have prove difficult for my team even to get response from let alone resolution other constituent tell of home leave empty for month in village where people be desperate for somewhere to live of property that could easily be bring up to modern energy standard just leave to deteriorate and moulder and of repair delay or do poorly that be inefficient and frustrating it border on the inhumane to be fair the government have recognise the issue in principle for which thank they the recent policy paper deliver decade of renewal for social and affordable housing call on provider to work with the government both to build new home and to upgrade existing one but the reality on the ground be that policy be not be enforce association continue to sell off rural stock while neglect maintenance and retrofit urge minister to pause the disposal of rural affordable housing by greensquareaccord and similar provider until the new policy framework be clarify it make no sense at all to sell the very home our community so desperately need we also need strong enforcement to ensure that housing association meet their obligation both to build new home and to maintain exist one to decent standard and there must be consequence for failure to meet those obligation ask the government to support council in rebuild their capacity to own housing stock directly wiltshire council have express that ambition and deserve the financial flexibility to make it reality on housing stock be proud to have be the leader of teignbridge district council draw the house attention to the fact that be still member which have build council house for the first time in year there be number of adjustment that can be make include increase the number of home from to before need housing revenue account and have meeting with the housing minister on make that easy the minister tell that he be go to announce that and make that happen but be not convince that that have yet happen do my hon friend agree that that be one of several adjustment the minister could easily make so that it be easy for council to build more council house that seem like an eminently sensible plan that wholeheartedly endorse come back to genuinely affordable housing across the south cotswolds there be planning tool design for exactly that purpose rural exception site be small parcel of land on the edge of village release specifically for affordable housing for people with strong local connection they be protect by legal agreement so that the home remain affordable in perpetuity when properly support and implement rural exception site can deliver well design home that keep community alive alongside that we also need to see community lead housing play big role with scheme initiate and own by local people often through community land trust such scheme build not just house but community the affordable home programme which be the government main grant scheme for affordable housing have real potential to help but it too often work for large urban development rather than small rural one it be an urban tool be implement in rural setting it can provide vital funding for social rent and community lead scheme yet the rule and deadline be often too rigid for parish level project therefore urge the minister to make the programme more flexible and to strengthen the rural uplift so that build dozen good quality energy efficient home in cotswold village be just as viable as build hundred on the edge of city be inspire by the tradition of alm house which be one of britain old and most dignified form of social housing be encourage to see an architecture award recently give to some alm house in london that show how modern design can honour that alm house heritage small beautiful and community orient with share garden and grow space can just imagine development in our market town and village similar to those we already have in cirencester although those be many hundred of year old do the hon lady have anything she want to say about the value of good design principle and link to the exist traditional architecture in specific community we have have great deal of success in our community in preserve the historical brickwork of reading and encourage new development to copy that style colour and range of brick see that the hon member for newbury mr dillon be nod he have the same local architecture with the same wonderful array of brick and sometimes use of flint as well would the hon lady like to see that highlight and encourage this be what we all want to see modern housing can be beautiful and blend almost seamlessly with exist housing stock in way that be pleasing to the eye it also help community to meld together when housing meld together there be many village in my constituency and obviously the cotswolds be associate with beautiful architecture in that lovely honey colour cotswold stone where the development be sympathetic it be welcome but there be other place where it be have be less sympathetic and that tend to have an impact on the relationship between the resident in the old village and those in the new development so yes wholeheartedly encourage and endorse the hon gentleman suggestion can imagine development like almshouse in our market town and village cluster of low energy home build with local material and ideally by local building firm surround by share green space for fruit and vegetable that be how we build not only home but community to make this happen plan policy must reward quality and community value not just sheer quantity rural exception site need to be protect and strengthen and national target must recognise environmental constraint we can not meet housing number by pave over flood plain and protect landscape public body should be require to release small site near service and bus route at fair value for social housing for convenience council must also be able to retain of right to buy receipt with long timeline so that they be able to replace lose home on like for like basis we must also address the pressure from short term let and second home distinct planning use class for short term let couple with local power to limit number and apply fair premium would help to ensure that home remain home not vehicle for investment this would help to keep our village alive so many of they be be hollow out with half or more of the home empty for much of the week mean that local pub shop and school really struggle to remain viable finally ask the minister to consider please south cotswolds pilot bring together homes england local council and housing association to plan small scale sustainable community orient social housing this would showcase what can be achieve when we design for place people and planet not for spreadsheet social housing be not statistic it be lifeline it keep the nurse in tetbury the teaching assistant in fairford and the young electrician in cirencester live in the community they serve it keep our school open our shop busy and our bus route viable look forward to hear the minister response and to work with she to ensure that every community in the south cotswolds have the affordable safe and sustainable home it need congratulate the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage on secure this important debate and thank the other hon member who have make contribution today have note their comment carefully the government recognise the acute housing pressure face rural community and be commit to ensure that the home build reflect genuine local need be affordable and be support by appropriate infrastructure this government be commit to build million home during this parliament and social and affordable home will make up an essential part of that we also acknowledge that not enough social and affordable housing have be deliver in recent decade that shortfall be now be feel acutely in area such as the south cotswolds where of the district lie within protect national landscape and further development must be carefully plan support the government ambition to build million home this debate refer more to social housing and wonder whether you could give an indication from the dispatch box order the hon gentleman must refer to the minister he can not keep say you it be exhausting apology can the minister give an indication of how many of those million home will be for social rent will come to that point for the hon member benefit crucial first step be ensure that local authority plan for the right number of home that mean assess housing need and then identify how much development be realistically deliverable take into account land availability environmental constraint such as flood risk and protect landscape and other relevant factor local authority can choose to go beyond their assess need to support wide goal such as economic growth and infrastructure investment and to accommodate housing from elsewhere we expect local authority to explore all option include maximise brownfield land collaborate across boundary and where necessary review green belt land in recent hearing of the public accounts committee on planning improvement we hear from the home builders federation that social house in england and wales remain unsold that seem to be an absolute tragedy when there be such demand for social housing ask the minister to look at that urgently will certainly consider that the national planning policy framework set out that local plan must deliver where practicable the amount type and tenure of home that community actually need that require carefully strike balance between enable necessary development and protect and enhance the natural environment thank the minister for give way she be be very generous with her time the number have double in my district of teignbridge of teignbridge be within dartmoor national park the rest of the area be constrain by the coast and house become more and more expensive to deliver as the number go up because of that expense few and few affordable home will be deliver the standard method be not work to reduce house price will the minister reconsider how these number be determined so that the standard method be no long use to enforce central number of home rather than the number of home that the district actually need note the constraint that the hon member raise and will certainly ask official to consider that in any plan these be not just plan challenge develop local plan involve human challenge we be now live with the cost of more than child in temporary accommodation and more than million household on local authority housing register that can not be allow to continue we recognise the shared ambition of those from across the sector to build more build well and build sustainably and we know that in area like south cotswolds where planning constraint be real and community character matter they be essential partner in help council to meet target and to safeguard what make place special strategic evidence lead local planning will ensure that development happen in the right place with proper community buy in housing association must be part of that conversation from the outset the national planning policy framework set out that the purpose of the planning system be to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development which include the provision of support infrastructure in sustainable way local development plan must address infrastructure need and opportunity identify what be require and how it can be fund and deliver that be essential to ensure that new home be not just build but be part of the thriving well service community that the hon member for south cotswolds have describe will the minister give way be not go to give way again be afraid the hon member for south cotswolds raise very real concern about flooding flooding can have devastating impact on community home and infrastructure which be why we take it seriously the government approach be guide by the nppf which be design to protect people and property from flooding it set out clear expectation that inappropriate development in flood prone area should be avoid the sequential test aim to ensure that new development be direct to area of low flood risk wherever possible where development must occur in high risk area the exception test require that it deliver wide sustainability benefit and be make safe without increase flood risk elsewhere those safeguard be in place to ensure that new home be not only safe but resilient to future climate impact we be also commit to deliver more sustainable drainage system through the planning system as set out in our plan for change we be firmly committed to deliver the big boost in generation to social and affordable house building to achieve that ambitious target we need every part of the sector include council and housing association to be work in lockstep and deliver to their full capacity we be take step to create the condition to ensure that provider across the country can once again deliver social and affordable housing at scale that include support council to update their local plan locate site for future development balance home with infrastructure like school and healthcare and actively engage community through public consultation since come to office we have seek to engage with the sector at every opportunity we have listen carefully to the view of social housing provider and their tenant on the problem they face and how good to resolve they but we have not only listen we have act at the spending review the chancellor announce record package of investment design to ensure that council and register provider can increase development of social and affordable housing as have be highlight the decade of renewal represent step change in our ambition to deliver social and affordable housing set out long term vision for build more home improve quality and strengthen community we recognise that for many the reality on the ground have yet to match that ambition but we be commit to bridge that gap through practical action step one of the decade of renewal have be to deliver the big long term investment in social and affordable housing in recent time we have confirm new year billion social and affordable home programme during its lifetime we hope to deliver around new home with at least for social rent that would result in around home for social rent six time more than the decade up to we also recognise that certain type of much need social and affordable housing can cost more to deliver particularly in area with environmental constraint or infrastructure gap the programme have be design to be flexible in order to ensure that it work not just for large urban development but for small scale rural project we encourage applicant to be ambitious when come forward with bid the programme full prospectus will be publish in the next few week and open for bid in the new year encourage all prospective provider to review their supply plan now to think big be bold and come forward with ambitious plan the hon lady should be assure that we understand the scale of the challenge and that we know the strength of this sector which be why we have pledge to forge renew partnership with the social and affordable housing sector to support building at scale she raise many other point to which will fully respond in writing with the support of my official the important point to stress be that together we can deliver the home our community need not just for today but for generation to come question put and agree to house adjourn
