be dsit minister today but the debate feel remarkably like the creative industry debate couple of week ago when be respond as the minister for creative industries arts and tourism will get on to some of the point about ai and copyright later so if anybody want to intervene on they can wait for that bit will start with some of the point hon member have make the measure on the nhs and datum be among the most positive in the bill and be welcome by everybody today it be not in the previous version of the bill it be one of our addition the other day colleague be tell about her local hospital and be strike by the fact that it employ people simply to carry around physical medical record we have put our back into change that that be not good way to preserve record or to ensure they be secure and not get lose let alone anything else my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley be absolutely right when he talk about patient passport we need to turn the issue on its head so that people have access to their datum and can participate in and make well decision about their own healthcare as say to my hon friend yesterday that be similar to the change that happen few year ago after an appointment consultant use to write to gp about the patient in doctor gobbledegook but now many of they write to the patient in plain english copy in the gp that be the kind of change we need to see be very hopeful about the change that will be introduce by the bill as my hon friend the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling say they will make dramatic difference we need to ensure the interoperability of all the it system use across the whole of the nhs would like to extend that beyond england and wales would not mind if we could manage to do the same for scotland and northern ireland but fear that even my friend the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart who like sometimes would baulk little at united kingdom wide approach to such matter be also excited about the element of the bill on smart datum which have barely have look in in today debate but which could be transformative in many sector many of we will know that when we use our banking app we be enable to go not just to our bank but to our insurance include our car insurance and all those thing can be relate to one another in secure way that be because of the smart datum system that have be in existence for the last few year we need to roll that out in many other sector and that be precisely what the bill allow for instance in the gig economy it will mean that uber driver and those deliver for deliveroo will have well understanding of whether they be actually earn living from each delivery thirdly nobody have refer to the reform of the information commissioner office it be an important part of the bill there have be brief mention of the register of birth and death which basically bring the modern world to the register office as former vicar suppose be more interested in that than most as have hatch and dispatch quite few in my time that be the original point that be try to make and obviously do not make it as well as the hon member do so congratulate he on that the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed be bit critical of article but think that he be be bit unfair the requirement in subsection and and then later in and of the article be very clear about the circumstance and they be the only circumstance in which the secretary of state can bring forward change of the kind to which he refer hope that we will be able to please he if not appease he if that matter appear in committee or on report just want to finish with some comment on ai and ip not least because there have be so much focus on this area all of we on the front bench want to have data bill because we think that it be really important for our economy and for so many different aspect of the way that we deliver government service we also want debate about ai and copyright which be why we launch the consultation but it feel odd to be do bit of that in this bill let turn now to what the shadow secretary of state say early ask chatgpt what the view of the shadow secretary of state be on ai and copyright it reply regard his view on copyright there be no publicly available information indicate that he have express specific opinion on this matter well yes we hear that this afternoon do we hope the opposition manage to find some idea at some point this be very serious matter and it be one of the trickiest issue that any country have to face at this point think that it be tricky for our country than most other because we be the third large ai economy in the world and we be probably the second or at bad the third great ip country in the world we have creator in every single sphere some country specialise in one particular form of the creative industry but we manage to do all of they that be why be listen very attentively to the contribution from my hon friend the members for bury north mr frith and for stirling and strathallan chris kane and the hon member for perth and kinross shire and many other as well just want to focus on the thing on which there be some agreement think there be agreement across the house on the idea that transparency be an important part of what we need to ensure in this legislation and on the aim of control over intellectual property right and on possibly end strong version of right reservation for the creative industry can announce that we have set up two work group in the past week both of which have people from the creative industry and from the ai company in they one be specifically look at transparency and what that look like to be effective and proportionate and it will start work on that next week secondly on the question of right reservation fully understand that people be sceptical about whether there be simple technical mean of everybody be about to assert their right
