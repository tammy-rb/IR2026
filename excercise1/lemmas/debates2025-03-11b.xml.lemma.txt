the holy grail seek by all government of whichever hue be economic growth therefore think it important for we to look through the lens of economic growth and to think about whether the bill drive it recall from my time in committee where spend many hour listen to the oratory of the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith that we speak great deal about productivity and whether it would be drive by the bill have speak about the possible impact of the bill to people in my community include representative of enlightened hr and alison bennett human resource consultant for whom its destination be very welcome indeed we have hear from many other people who have be consult that the bill destination and aspiration be correct and appropriate but it be question of how we get there and whether the government have achieve the right balance between employer and employee that be important because the last thing we want the bill to do be have chilling effect on the economy we be only too well aware that the national insurance contribution that be set to kick in next month be already have that negative impact and we do not want this well intend bill to echo that far there be amendment before we at this late stage of the legislation the minister say that that be due to level of consultation and so forth and should be welcome and that we be trim our sail but if that be the case and if the minister be in such listen mode in committee why do the government accept no opposition amendment whatsoever should welcome some reflection from the minister when he wind up the debate as liberal democrat and the liberal democrat spokesman for the department for work and pensions can say that carer be at the front and centre of our world what be effectively the population of people year or day walk away from the employment market to take up caring occupation and in many instance support family member that have an billion annual impact on our economy which leave we less productive hope that the government will give serious thought to our amendment to make leave for carer pay opportunity because give they that flexibility and that breathe space would unlock more people for our employment market our proposal to make care protect characteristic be extremely important we have already hear about harassment and discrimination in connection with other part of the bill but this would help immensely to support carer double the pay of those take adoption leave be also important as be support for people who take caring role such as kinship care hope that the ministers will take those family role into account
