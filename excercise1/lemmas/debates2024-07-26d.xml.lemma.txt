shadow minister thank you madam deputy speaker congratulate you on your elevation thank the paymaster general for his statement and thank he very much for the customarily early sight of his statement this morning the finding of the infected blood inquiry remain shameful moment for the british state first of all reiterate our apology to all those whose life have be change as result of this

be affect and infect as quickly as possible before the election be call on may take number of step to ensure that interim compensation of would be pay as quickly as possible to those register with exist infected blood support scheme as well as those who register with the support scheme before the final scheme become operational and to the estate of those who pass away between then and payment be make be delighted that the paymaster general this morning confirm that over billion have now be pay during the run up to the general election the legislation pass on may establish the infected

legislation receive royal assent we ask for an update to be provide to the house within sit day of the inquiry final report be publish believe that the statement this morning honour that welcome the fact that the new government have continue to prioritise this issue and to keep the house and of course the victim and their family update on progress however there remain question and matter on which think the infected and affected blood community would respectfully expect to challenge the government will the paymaster general confirm that the debate that promise after the whitsun recess could be schedule for september that would give member reasonable amount of time over the recess to study this considerable report will he reiterate my commitment to respond to sir brian recommendation one by one as quickly as possible within comprehensive response to the report be grateful today that the paymaster general be consider the advice from sir robert engagement with the infected blood community in june hope that he will not just consider it but decide to publish it in advance of the august deadline for make regulation in my modest experience any regulation lay would be open to misinterpretation unless the government set out sir robert consider reflection on the engagement exercise that he supervise and his consider judgment on what change if any to qualifying criterion and parameter may be require to ensure that the scheme have maximum credibility believe that the paymaster general new ministerial colleague the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson would also advise he that maximum early transparency will yield maximum understanding and acceptance of the path forward be anxious that the guard optimism hear during my meeting with representative from group in may will be sustain and that the good will generate on the path the delivery will not be squander give my commitment this morning that will seek to support the paymaster general as he complete the delicate process of finalise regulation by build on the engagement exercise and the invaluable work of sir jonathan montgomery and his expert team on wide matter can the paymaster general confirm that the billion he refer to represent the completion of the day interim compensation commitment or indicate to the house what quantum be outstanding and confirm that that will be pay within the day that set out on may it be critical that sir brian forensic assessment of culpability across the medical civil service and ministerial domain be properly address as part of the government evolve think on legislation on the duty of candour while recognise that this be ultimately matter for this house it would be good if the paymaster general could define what role the public administration and constitutional affairs committee could play in scrutinise the government progress follow my statement on may the paymaster general refer to potential criminal charge and ask to ensure that all relevant evidence would be make available for consideration by the prosecute authority will he update the house now on whether he be in position to be able to do so also ask he to reiterate my acknowledgement of the call for memorialisation and to say whether he will appropriately frame the commitment the government will make to the recommendation by the end of as commit to do finally wish the paymaster general every success in this delicate work believe that he be well support by an excellent team of civil servant to complete this work and he will have my full support as he operationalise the legislation that the previous government pass on may be very grateful to the right hon gentleman for the characteristically collegiate way in which he approach his perfectly reasonable question shall deal with they one by one will certainly push for the debate to be schedule as soon as possible it be really important that across the house we be able to comprehensively consider not just the recommendation but the level and scale of the criticism that have be make yes the government will respond one by one to the recommendation make by sir brian langstaff in relation to sir robert francis entirely agree with the right hon gentleman about the need for transparency certainly undertake to publish those finding and that report ahead of the regulation to operationalise the scheme be lay by august in relation to the right hon member point about the day my understanding be that the payment be complete on june which be within that day period but there will be as announce in my statement additional interim payment to the estate of infected people and that process will begin from october with regard to parliamentary scrutiny welcome the scrutiny that there rightly will be on this whether it be by pacac or indeed by the house more generally certainly undertake as the right hon gentleman do to ensure that all relevant information be provide to the prosecute authority as they see fit for any action that need to be take against specific individual finally in respect of memorialisation sir brian langstaff set out that there should be memorial in the constituent part of the united kingdom and also specific memorial to those child who be send to treloar for protection but who end up in the hideous situation of be experiment on when they be at their most vulnerable look forward to take forward the process as the right hon gentleman commit to do of ensure that we do have appropriate memorialisation which be crucial to recognise the scale of what happen may congratulate you madam deputy speaker on your elevation to your position welcome the minister statement this morning but can he say little more about how the compensation authority will arrive at its decision there be concern that adviser have undue influence on the cabinet office and that the voice of those who have be infect and affect be not be hear sufficiently in this process there be concern about the compensation process and whether that will be in addition to or conflate with support payment the non payment of exemplary or punitive damage the lack of recognition of the impact of illegal experimentation or the knowing use of contaminate blood product and the payment that will be make to estate where people have die the people who really should be scrutinise this be those who have be infect and affect so will the minister commit to involve they in the compensation authority so that they can have confidence in the decision that be be make be grateful to my hon friend for his question first may say that of course the voice of victim should be absolutely central to this thank sir robert francis for the work that he do in the general election purdah period to ensure that that be the case will consider very carefully the recommendation that sir robert make on the basis of that engagement and hear the voice of the victim want to deal with one other point that my hon friend raise which be to do with the future of the infected blood support scheme understand that there have be concern about this the current proposal be that no immediate change will be make to the infected blood support scheme payment will continue to be make at the same level until march next year and they will not be deduct from any compensation award from april next year people who receive the england infect blood support scheme payment will continue to receive they until such time that their case be assess under the new scheme by the infected blood compensation authority once assess under the scheme the applicant will be able to choose how to receive their compensation either as lump sum or periodic payment hope that that give my hon friend the reassurance he seek have absolute confidence in sir robert francis to run the infected blood compensation authority in an entirely appropriate way be in the chamber when his appointment as the interim chair be announce and it be welcome warmly as recall from the public gallery by the infected blood community call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be pleasure to see you in the chair follow your election madam deputy speaker thank the paymaster general for early sight of his statement and welcome the tone and the cross party approach that have be take on this serious issue

the scandal chair by sir brian langstaff lay bare the suffering inflict the cover up and the systemic failure across the british state not only do the state fail to help the victim but in many case people be lie to treat with contempt and outright dismiss now we have the evidence and we have hear and read the most personal and courageous testimony from victim one of my constituent in north east fife be participant in the inquiry and have meet other in the constituency it be imperative that every one of we work across the aisle to deliver this effective and just compensation scheme we welcome the work by sir robert francis and david foley in set up the ibca it be clear that transparency be vital in establish trust between the ibca and the infected blood community so be pleased to hear that the ibca meet with the community over the election period but would be grateful for more detail from the paymaster general about what the ongoing work with the community will look like not only do we have duty to support the victim and their family with fair compensation settlement but in order to create lasting solution we must ensure that the state can not let such scandal happen again therefore be glad that the paymaster general agree that we need to adopt duty of candour for public official to ensure that victim be never treat in this manner again give that we have so many inquiry ongoing can he give more detail on when the legislation on candour that he refer to will be bring forward be grateful to the hon lady for those question and look forward to work with she on this issue on cross party basis throughout the next few month and suspect for quite bit long really do echo her point about the need for cross party working the hon lady make very fair point about the need to establish trust between the victim and the compensation body that will be vital she also ask to say little more about the voice of victim be hear it will be for the government to consider sir robert francis recommendation which follow on from his extensive engagement with victim and victim group during the purdah period as say to the shadow paymaster general moment or two ago agree with he entirely about the need for transparency in the publication of sir robert francis work and report ahead of august will be write to the victim group to ensure that their voice continue to be hear the duty of candour stand alongside other measure that we be bring forward include the public advocate and ensure that family who find themselves in the tragic situation that many do with hillsborough be able to be appropriately represent at inquest we need to see those measure as collective package but we will be bring they forward as soon as we can my constituent justine and rachel gordon smith lose their father six year ago on wednesday he suffer from haemophilia and be give infected blood in the welcome today statement the current compensation scheme make provision for child of affected person only while they be under the age of which do not take into account the long term impact face by my constituent will my right hon friend meet and my constituent to discuss this matter and ensure that the scheme support all affected person in edinburgh north and leith and across the country first think the whole house will have every sympathy with the situation that my hon friend constituent and their family find themselves in in the scheme there be of course those who be infect and those who be affect who include partner parent child sibling and quite rightly those who provide care to infected people because there be often situation where the carer be not necessarily close relative but none the less provide significant care if my hon friend could please write to can ensure that there be an appropriate ministerial meeting too congratulate you madam deputy speaker on your recent elevation thank the minister for advance sight of his statement which be very welcome echo his word by acknowledge that the infected blood inquiry be one of the great scandal of our age pay tribute to the victim and their family who have fight tirelessly to bring matter to this point be glad to hear that the minister be commit to meet the august deadline for lay regulation to establish the final compensation scheme but be little disappointed that he do not set out full timescale for the full operation of the scheme it would be helpful if he say little more about that will he comment on his commitment to work closely with the scottish government on the scheme implementation in scotland to ensure that victim seek redress face no further delay echo what the hon gentleman say about the scale of the scandal and his appropriate tribute to the victim on the timescale as indicate in my statement the additional interim payment to the estate of the infected will start from october as indicate at question yesterday in respect of the full scheme would expect the final compensation payment to start be pay from the end of this year it be my intention to meet the health ministers of the devolved administrations in my native wales in scotland and in northern ireland be committed to work with the devolved administration as indicate early they will have key role to play in the memorialisation process too congratulate you on your new position madam deputy speaker welcome the front benchers to their role and thank they for the content and tone of the statement my constituent will welcome that update however this be not an isolated incident in which the state have fail to protect its citizen we have have the horizon post office scandal the hillsborough family and the child migration scheme matter in which must declare an interest for which former prime minister gordon brown give national apology back in will the paymaster general assure and my constituent that the government be commit to bring about the culture change that be so clearly need as those scandal show yes can give that commitment should really emphasise its importance as indicate moment or two ago we be commit to the introduction of duty of candour we be commit to ensure that family be support at inquest and inquiry particularly for situation such as hillsborough and we be commit to public advocate those be all really important step that we need to take ultimately that have to be accompany by

collective work to get the house to this position of provide reassurance to those who have be impact also thank the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson for her work as part of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood there be still concern about how the payment will be make to the estate of those who have die there be risk that if such payment be make to the estate they will be direct away from those who have be most impact my understanding be that it be currently expect that the executor of will will decide how compensation payment be make to family member and the payment may not go to those who have be most impact how will the paymaster general ensure that the payment get to those who be most impact the hon gentleman make fair point echo his tribute to his constituent clive smith for all his remarkable campaigning over many year in respect of the hon gentleman second point on the probate process and ensure that the money actually reach those it be suppose to reach the government be consider how we can well support victim through the probate process hope to have further detail on that in due

make recommendation to the cabinet office as my hon friend the member for cardiff west mr barros curtis say there have be number of compensation scheme but they seem to be ad hoc and lesson be not always learn about how to deliver they so victim in the middle get squeeze hope that my right hon friend the minister can tell we that he will be consider that and come out with recommendation in due course be grateful to my hon friend for that question she be entirely right that we need to learn lesson from previous compensation scheme where they have go well and frankly where they have go not so well where after look at and reflect upon they we see that the proportion of money that we want to go to victim do not quite make it certainly give the reassurance that we be look at those previous scheme and try to learn good practice from they congratulation on your elevation madam deputy speaker this statement be welcome in my constituency where it be estimate that between and people be infect with hiv and approximately be infect with hepatitis after blood transfusion will the minister join in pay tribute to the campaigner who have fight so hard to move this campaign and search for

lesson for the future thank my right hon friend for this update he mention that one of the crucial point in this scandal be the fact that child be identify because of their genetic condition would my right hon friend explain how that issue will be look at how on earth can we compensate child who be identify at very young age many of they have since die they need substantial compensation and much more support than think they be currently get my hon friend refer to one of the most chilling aspect of this scandal there be no varnish this the reality be that child with haemophilia go to an institution treloar school for protection the school be set up in such way that it be mean to give reassurance to parent that their child condition would be appropriately care for but they be actually use for medical experimentation it be absolutely shameful and appalling of course my hon friend be right about appropriate compensation but it be also vital that as we go through sir brian langstaff recommendation we put in place procedure standard and structure so that something like that can never happen again last week in my constituency meet mike and diana blake who tell the harrowing story of their son stuart stuart be infect by contaminate blood and be then infect with hiv and hepatitis he be just six year old stuart live and suffer and pass away aged in the torment of the blake family

sympathy to the blake family on the loss of their son stuart in such appalling tragic circumstance as indicate moment or two ago do not think any of we can conceive of the grief of lose child in those circumstance but stuart parent be clearly people who be affect they be exactly the kind of people whom the scheme have in mind whether they be partner parent child sibling or those who provide care it be absolutely critical that the compensation body recognise their suffering thank my right hon friend for his statement would like to talk about linda one of my constituent who sadly lose her husband bill dumbelton because of the infected blood scandal he contract hiv and hepatitis and lose his job when he tell his employer that he have hiv he have no life insurance he be unable to get life insurance at that time because of his hiv status so linda have to pick up the piece and deal with all the financial problem when he die can the paymaster general please update the house on how the

can he update the house as to what measure be be put in place to learn the lesson of this scandal include on the indefensible time it have take to put it right and on improve mechanism for

they as request in the timeline that sir brian mention in the report in addition we need to introduce the duty of candour and the public advocate to support family at inquest and inquiry and above all

too many scandal over recent year such as hillsborough horizon this infected blood scandal and the woman against state pension inequality do the minister agree that people have to fight far too hard and for far too long to get the recognition and justice they deserve and that this simply have to change my hon friend be absolutely right hillsborough horizon number of other past scandal and this one be all severe and awful injustice but what make they even bad and compound they be then have to fight for decade and decade that be simply unacceptable and it be one of the thing that this government be determined to change like many other in the house have constituent who have be deeply impact by this scandal and will welcome the statement do the minister agree that it be vital that we take action not only to deliver the compensation but to tackle the culture of defensiveness which we have see in this scandal and in every other scandal that have emerge if we do not tackle it now it be never go to change my hon friend be absolutely right anyone who read sir brian langstaff report will see the emphasis he put on culture and the chilling nature of what he talk about as institutional defensiveness that be something we need to change we will put forward legislative measure that we hope will make significant difference but it be also question of attitude and culture and change that will require leadership can the paymaster general clarify whether an office for the whistleblower would be an independent office that would be helpful in progress the sort of clarity and transparency that he have refer to protection for whistleblower be important it be something the government be consider and keep under constant review thank you madam deputy speaker and

the implementation of the recommendation in order to ensure fair and proper compensation and true accountability for this scandal we have to listen to the relative include the child of those who have die as result of this scandal it be an awful fact that thousand of people have die now we must listen to their relative who be their voice for today in this process like many member have constituent

the impact that it have have on other the people we call the affected people as consequence of this scandal with regard to the culture of institutional defensiveness the critical thing be that people do not put protect individual reputation or the reputation of institution above what be in the public interest or above the duty of public service be not suggest for moment that that be an easy thing to lead on but it be certainly something that this government be determined to lead on and of course undertake to update the house regularly on that call john slinger to ask the last question thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your elevation to your position do my right hon friend agree that the public note that all too often in such case of egregious state failure prosecution do not follow it appear to the public that there be in some way impunity compensation be belatedly give reform be make but all too often individual be not hold accountable that be part of the problem that we be discuss this morning will he commit to give further update on the step that may be take to ensure that individual be hold properly accountable whether individual be prosecute be rightly matter that be independent of government that be for the crown prosecution service what do undertake to do be ensure that all relevant information be make available to the prosecute authority so that the decision can be an informed decision base on the evidence also undertake as my hon friend ask to keep the house update on that make britain clean energy superpower beg to move that this house have consider the matter of make britain clean energy superpower it be genuine pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker and privilege to open this debate on the government plan to make britain clean energy superpower it be also genuine privilege to have be ask to do the good job in government think the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie would concur and serve as energy minister the urgency of the multiple challenge that we face as country be the reason why this government be move at such pace on this mission first we have the challenge of energy insecurity and our over reliance on fossil fuel market which be lay bare by putin invasion of ukraine accord to the international monetary fund the soar inflation that britain suffer as result of the energy crisis be far bad than in any other country that lead to the second challenge which many of our constituent be still face skyrocket consumer bill with the default tariff price cap rise by approximately in the year after the invasion thirdly while family continue to face the bad cost of live crisis in generation there be still huge demand for good job with good wage across every part of the uk but perhaps particularly in the industrial heartland that have too often be leave behind in both the good and the bad time fourthly there be the challenge pose by the climate crisis which grow more and more urgent every day we be now halfway through the most decisive decade in prevent irreversible damage to our planet this be our last chance to limit global warming to and frankly we be way off track this government be determined to address these challenge but unlike our predecessor we do not see they as separate issue pull we in different direction case of either green or growth each of these challenge point to the same solution green energy future because invest in clean energy at speed and scale be the only way to deliver energy security and to save family from future energy shock it will also create ten of thousand of good skilled job the hon gentleman mention family and energy price during the general election campaign the labour party and labour candidate across the country claim that gb energy will save the average british household year however the secretary of state refuse to repeat this claim when give the chance last week there have be quite lot of confusion in the national medium over the past couple of day with downing street say one thing and the department for energy security and net zero say another can the minister now confirm on the parliamentary record how much gb energy will save or cost british bill payer by the time of the next election he be absolutely right that all these thing be part of labour energy plan for the country so we need to know how much it will cost or save british taxpayer thank the right hon gentleman for his question but it take bit of brass neck to come here and talk about bring down bill when the government he support for so long see those bill skyrocket we have be very clear that bill will come down we say it throughout the campaign we say it yesterday and we stand by it because bill must come down but this will not happen overnight hon member ah the opposition front bench make noise now but they have waste year we now need to catch up on this mission we will catch up and we will bring down bill will my hon friend give way will make bit of progress if that be okay we will create thousand of skilled job which crucially will also tackle the climate crisis that we have not do enough to tackle in recent year it be for these reason that the prime minister have make make britain clean energy superpower one of his five mission the government have clear long term plan to deliver that mission by increase our energy independence protect consumer and deliver good job and climate leadership the outcome of that plan will be the decarbonisation of our power supply by and an acceleration to net zero across our economy to achieve that mission we need to forge new path that move away from these volatile fossil fuel market that be why be so delighted to introduce the great british energy bill to parliament yesterday the bill correct an anomaly in our energy ownership in which we have widespread public ownership of energy in this country just not by we we have offshore wind farm that be own by the government of denmark france norway and sweden but not our own many of my constituent in ealing southall be incredibly excited by the minister plan for great british energy for take back control of our energy system and for lower the bill of hard press family but do he agree that the conservative party will have confuse many of my resident with its support for public ownership of energy infrastructure only by foreign government and not by the british government take into account his great plan to make this country an energy superpower do he agree order thank the hon lady for her helpful intervention and be very happy to agree with she there be confusion at the heart of the conservative party plan they have be very happy to hand over key part of our national infrastructure to foreign government for the profit go to the public in those country but they have be ideologically oppose to any suggestion that the british taxpayer should have any stake in those future that be something that we will turn around will my hon friend give way will and apologise for not do so early be grateful to my hon friend and welcome he to his position think it be clear to everyone that the early advance of the great british energy bill demonstrate the government priority their commitment to drive down carbon emission and the cost of energy and their recognition that that can happen only through public ownership and private investment that be something that the last government fail to understand know that we will debate the bill second reading after the summer recess but could my hon friend say something about gb energy have control stake in new energy project and support to ensure that the public benefit perhaps he might also say something about the vexed issue of energy storage because that will constitute huge part of the programme my hon friend have raise two important point to answer the first gb energy will invest in range of project and will have key stake in they deliver return for the british taxpayer there will be range of project in some of which we will certainly have the control stake and some of which we might help to get over the line but in every single project there will be return for the british taxpayer my hon friend second point be vital have be in this role for only couple of week but every meeting have come back to this question of connection storage and how we make sure that renewable can be deliver throughout period in which there be electricity demand storage will be important and gb energy will have part to play in that as well as in answer wide question about grid and network let return to the point about ownership by foreign country british water be home to one of the large offshore float wind farm in the world kincardine off the coast of aberdeen it be good example of the problem with the current model the foundation be make in spain the turbine be instal in the netherlands and only then be it tow into british water our view be that british taxpayer should own some of that infrastructure which be why yesterday the prime minister and the energy secretary announce an exciting new partnership between gb energy and the crown estate to unleash billion of pound of investment in clean power this partnership will enable two national institution to work together for the benefit of the british people as well as build supply chain gb energy will develop and own power project in every part of the united kingdom in england wales scotland and northern ireland it will be capitalise with billion over the lifetime of this parliament money that can be invest in wind solar nuclear tidal and other technology and it will deliver profit to the british people play vital role in deliver the new job that we need the government plan to ban new oil and gas licence have be criticise by business leader union and community group throughout scotland as fellow scottish member will the minister say whether or not he support his government plan which it have be say will put up to job across scotland at risk we make it very clear during the election that the future of the north sea be incredibly important but that future be transition away from the oil and gas industry that we see at present the conservatives also need to recognise that the north sea be decline basin we have lose thousand of job there over the past decade and that will continue in the future unless we accelerate our transition in the north sea to the clean energy job of the future it be not good enough to bury our head in the sand and pretend that this problem do not exist we need plan to give people secure long term sustainable job for the future rather than think that we can just carry on with business as usual the minister have refer continually to the role of gb energy but how will it deliver low gas price only yesterday one of his colleague the secretary of state for energy security and net zero admit that the price of gas be determine on the international market be not sure that the hon gentleman understand the purpose of gb energy but it be not to bring down gas price it be to bring down bill the whole point of gb energy be to move we away from our over reliance on gas if we be not reliant on gas price we will remove that risk to bill from the shock that we receive from the international market but we can do that only if we invest in the clean energy of the future do the minister agree that the energy crisis be matter not just of supply but of demand and that the cheap bill be the one that do not have to be pay because the energy be not be use do he intend to announce today way of tackle the demand side we could for example ensure that all new building be build to net zero standard and announce timeline for get to that point as soon as possible we could also announce nationwide street by street insulation programme to tackle the need for energy efficiency that be the cheap and quick way to address the energy crisis if he be not go to make those announcement today when will they be make thank the hon lady for her intervention she have perhaps be read our manifesto because agree with everything she have just say that be why we be announce warm home agency and look at energy efficiency across the public and residential sector and why we will massively upscale that domestic investment will come back to her point in more detail later it be almost as if she know what be go to talk about an announcement be make recently about collaboration with the crown estate and how it will work with gb energy in pembrokeshire we have fantastic opportunity in the form of float offshore wind the crown estate be undertake the leasing process for the seabed can the minister assure we that there will be bind commitment to there be local content in the supply chain and to address the skill gap in the region thank my hon friend who have already become very strong advocate for his constituent he corner in the library to talk about these issue and long may he continue to do so he raise really important point the whole point of our partnership with the crown estate be that we will be able to look not just at investment in the clean power that we need but at the supply chain create good job in industrial community our commitment to the british job bonus mean that we will invest in those job in this country create the skill for the future finally on gb energy as scottish mp it would be wrong of not to say that be incredibly proud that great british energy will be headquarter in scotland it be signal of our commitment to deliver the good job that community need and to bring the expertise and skill of scotland grow renewable sector to the table as we drive forward towards even more ambitious plan across the whole country in the drive seat of these ambition be our new mission control centre lead by the former chief executive of the climate change committee chris stark mission control be about bring together the good mind across whitehall but also crucially outside of whitehall so that we can set the direction monitor progress and remove all the barrier in the way whether they relate to the planning grid supply chain or skill so that the government can work with one voice to deliver this plan on barrier one of the key challenge be the capacity of our construction industry be my hon friend have conversation across government about how we resolve that issue so that we can deliver on this crucial agenda of move towards net zero my hon friend make an incredibly important point this transition have to be hand in hand with the industrial strategy that the government be drive forward that be why the minister of state department for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for croydon west sarah jones be also business and trade minister that will bring together work right across government on the industrial strategy we also have to look at the skill for the future and develop the next generation of apprentice and skilled worker who will be in job that will be with we long into the future my hon friend have mention scotland but would like to mention wales again as do my hon friend the member for mid and south pembrokeshire henry tufnell monmouthshire have plenty of wind and wave opportunity we have the tidal river severn and we also have small tributary in the wye valley such as the angidy above tintern my constituent be really look forward to benefit from the community energy project mention in the bill when can our community energy project start bid into the process think for moment that my hon friend be go to make bid for gb energy to be headquarter in wales which be one thing that can not commit to she raise really important point one of the mission of gb energy will be around the idea of community own power we have to bring two thing together we want community to be in the drive seat of much of this in the future but also to have some sense of ownership of the asset we also know that some of the small generation project can be the most successful if we can bring together the benefit of community ownership with small scale generation project that would deal with some of the issue regard the grid and network because we would not be try to bring power to community from far away there be real appetite for that and it be some of the early work that gb energy will do the government have move quickly on two aspect one of which be onshore wind we sweep away some of the significant barrier that have hold we back for far too long within hour of come into office we remove the de facto ban on onshore wind in england that mean that just single objection to wind turbine prevent it from be build onshore wind be quick and cheap to build and it become one of the cheap source of power that we have under the ban in place for nearly decade under the conservative party only two onshore wind turbine be build in the whole of england and the pipeline of project shrink by nearly we be now consult on bring large onshore project back into the nationally significant infrastructure project regime and we have establish an onshore wind taskforce to tackle the deplete pipeline of project to help we on our way to double onshore wind by the end of the decade we also have to speed up the roll out of solar power that mean not leave planning decision languish on desk for month after month but get on with make decision that be why my right hon friend the secretary of state consent to gw of solar power the equivalent of home the minister talk of solar farm in huntingdon the propose east park energy solar farm stretch for six mile from great staughton to across the constituency boundary and be at acre large than gatwick airport local resident have grave concern about the scale of that development what commitment will he make to our rural community that they will have say over the labour government allow large solar farm to be build in local area give the detrimental impact on they the hon gentleman be right to represent his constituent of course and we will not in any way remove the ability of community to be part of the consultation process and the planning system but the issue be that this have not be happen for so long we need to move forward with some of this infrastructure we want to look at the benefit that community will get from it range of option be be look at but at some point we need national recognition that some infrastructure be necessary and nationally significant some community will have to host that infrastructure and there should be benefit for they to do so it do not mean that we should stop do these thing the day of the government pass the buck to future generation to fix the issue be go we need to tackle the crisis and that mean that we will build project in community with consultation of course because nationally significant project will have to go ahead if we want to reach our target by in one week more solar capacity be deliver by this government than through all previous solar project consent to by the department and its predecessor combine we have reconvene the solar taskforce to explore what else government and industry can do to help we to treble solar power by underpin renewable base system will be baseload of nuclear power we want to see hinkley point operational this decade with extension to the currently operate fleet and we be also support the development of new site such as sizewell meanwhile great british nuclear be continue to drive forward the competition for small modular reactor with bid currently be evaluate by the department there have be much debate about the role the north sea will play and what just transition will look like the reality as mention early be that the north sea be mature basin with decline reserve figure from the office for national statistics suggest that the number of direct job support by the oil and gas industry have already fall by more than third since regard the potential closure of the grangemouth refinery the just transition commission recently say that the uk government have take positive step in work collaboratively with the scottish government there be no doubt that we be behind schedule because of the previous government inaction will my hon friend provide an update on when the grangemouth future industry board leadership forum will next meet again thank my hon friend not just for his intervention but for all the work he have do before and since his election he have be dedicated campaigner on this issue and have raise it number of time with and my right hon friend the secretary of state my hon friend point about collaboration be incredibly important we have reset our relation with the devolved administrations across the country in particular on grangemouth we have be work hard with the scottish government to find solution that have be far more helpful set of intervention than we have from the previous government for example on project willow we have commit to joint funding with the scottish government to drive forward to find solution we be leave no stone unturned to secure an industrial future for the grangemouth site and know that my hon friend will continue to campaign on the issue the future of the north sea more generally depend on have plan for the industry of the future whether that be carbon capture and storage hydrogen or indeed renewable the just transition be critical and it be something take incredibly seriously so we will work with north sea community to develop credible long term plan that work will be support by british job bonus to incentivise developer to build their supply chain here in the uk and to create good job in our industrial heartland and coastal community we will make sure that our offshore worker be the people who decarbonise our country and deliver our energy independence and that there be strong resilient workforce in the north sea for decade to come my hon friend very importantly mention the role that carbon capture usage and storage have to play in the decarbonisation of our economy be sure he will have see the late national audit office report on ccus and will therefore be aware that the department have increase its reliance on ccus substantially since this be first moot the nao be clear in its report that uncertainty remain about the funding available for future stage of the ccus project proposal that the previous government be behind in agree support for track and that future progress on the programme be dependent on reach financial investment decision for at least some of the track project very swiftly will he give we an update if not now at some point later on how this essential part of the programme will be handle my hon friend raise very important point the department be review the nao report at the moment this area will need investment but we also need concerted effort to understand what some of the barrier be it be very clear that carbon capture and storage will be critical part of the north sea infrastructure in the future so we be take those issue very seriously very much welcome much of what the minister have say in this announcement include on the need for just transition for those work in the oil and gas sector however before the election the government make commitment to end new oil and gas licence although they be still plan to allow the new rosebank oil field to open despite it be connect to level of carbon emission that we simply can not allow in this country have two question about the future of oil and gas first will the minister confirm how and when the ending of new oil and gas licence will happen secondly will the government reconsider the opening of the disastrous rosebank oil and gas field be hopeful that that be go to be very positive question but then we get to however thank the hon lady for her support of what have say so far north sea licensing be an important issue we be clear throughout the election that we do not intend to issue any further licence in the north sea we be look at how exactly that will come into force and lot of detailed work be go on because we want to give assurance to the industry on the question of rosebank and some of those other field we have say that we will not bring to an end any of the licence that be currently in place can not speak on some of the particular issue because there be of course case before the court but we will come back to the house in due course to set out the detail what be important be that we have say that we do not want any new licence in the north sea and we stand by that commitment we now want to work out detailed plan so that that just transition to which the hon lady rightly refer can come into effect wish to finish on the warm home plan which the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns mention early and be so committed to support and we be grateful to she for that it will invest billion in clean heat and energy efficiency over the lifetime of this parliament double the previously plan investment to upgrade million home with grant and low interest loan to support investment in insulation low carbon heating and other home improvement the late government figure show that million household in england be in fuel poverty in the private rented sector the figure be one in four shamefully the last government abandon their commitment to get those home up to decent standard of energy efficiency but we will not abandon tenant we will ensure that home in the private rent sector meet minimum energy standard by save renter hundred of pound year will the hon member give way will carry on if that be okay we will ensure that we have regulator that fight for consumer as well we have see repeat failure in recent year include the scandal of the force installation of prepayment meter poor customer service and consumer pick up the cost when company go to the wall the government will overhaul the mandate power remit and redress of ofgem and we will reduce the burden of standing charge which have rise by since the start of we will hold company to account for wrongdoing and ensure that there be automatic compensation for those fail by their energy supplier finally the next month in the run up to be critical to ramp up and deliver on our global climate commitment britain must and will regain its influence on the international stage so we will work with international partner to raise ambition include by lead clean power alliance that bring together coalition of country to accelerate the clean energy transition the government clean energy mission and our wide energy agenda be critical not just for that international leadership but as route to low bill energy security and good long term job there be no doubt that we be play catch up if we succeed and success be vital for all of the reason that have outline the benefit will be substantial and feel by everyone long into the future we have waste no time as government get start in pursue this mission and look forward to the contribution of hon member across the house so that together we can deliver this critical agenda for the future of our country call the opposition spokesperson thank you madam deputy speaker and may say how wonderful it be to see you in the chair warmly welcome the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks to his place on the government front bench know that he use to be schoolteacher wonderful profession and be sure that his ability to wrangle with unruly child will help he with his work in this place also welcome the continuation of the fine tradition start by my hon friend the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie of have minister from scotland in the department for energy security and net zero scotland have play and will continue to play vital role in our energy security and know that the hon member will bring his local expertise to the role be surprised to see the title of this debate under the conservative government we build more offshore wind than any other country bar china much of it drive by our contract for difference scheme which weave together the conservative principle of competition and enterprise it be under the conservative government that we go from have of our electricity come from renewable energy to almost half today and it be under the conservative government that we kick start the large nuclear revival in year commit to three large scale nuclear reactor and whole new fleet of small and advanced modular reactor that be the record that have lead to more than billion be invest in green technology since create job up and down the country the labour party like to say that the difference between we be that they be the climate believer and we be the climate denier but that be obviously nonsense it be under the conservative government that we become the first country in the to have halve carbon emission and we do that while grow the economy the real difference between we be this we know that the transition need to happen but we recognise that it be now at stage where we be ask the british public to incur great cost to change their car their home and many other thing we be way ahead of other country and what happen next be not cost free if it be not manage carefully if it be drive by ideology rather than the national interest then it will cost we job hit struggle family and leave we reliant on fuel import from foreign regime this country will succeed in the decade ahead only if we have enough cheap energy to power our nation it be no use be world lead at cut emission if the cost of our energy go through the roof and all our business leave to set up in country that still burn coal for of their energy that would be bad for global emission and disaster for the british public we will do our bit from the opposition benches to hold the government to account on their plan but my message to those mps now sit on the government benches be that it be in their interest to ask these crucial question too throughout the general election campaign the people now sit on the benches behind the minister tell their new constituent that their plan would save they on their energy bill they say it in husting they say it in local medium they say it on their leaflet but they will have notice by now that their ministers be no long say that at all this be the problem madam deputy speaker when you get into government and you speak in the house you can not use number for which you have no basis interruption labour member will learn that but their they laugh but their voter will not forget that they make that promise their online clip and social medium account will not go away they all know that their leadership have sell they down the river on this one the prime minister and the secretary of state know that those saving can not be deliver in fact their approach to energy will add huge cost to people bill that be not we be evil tories it be also the view of the european lead for mitsubishi power who say that the labour party plan would require huge sacrifice from brits it be the view of the gmb trade union which have say that the secretary of state plan will lead to power cut and blackout across the country and come at an enormous cost and it be the view of the tony blair institute which say that labour plan would raise bill and harm our energy security people the labour party normally listen to from the right to the left of the party agree with we on this issue urge the hon member sit behind the minister to take this issue seriously and examine his plan in detail because it be their promise which they all make just few week ago that be be ditch come the next election the first question their voter will ask be not have you meet the target but what do you do to my energy bill if the trade union the business leader and the conservative party be right that their approach would place huge cost on british household can tell they that their constituent will check the parliamentary record and see whether they ask any question and they will have to explain why they let these measure pass without challenge have to congratulate the right hon lady on her chutzpah after year of conservative government have examine closely those net zero policy the stop start on feed in tariff the fail competition for carbon capture and storage and the stalling of new nuclear she do not have record that she should be proud to stand on and would have hop that she would graciously accept and back the innovative plan of the labour government have enormous respect for the hon lady but disagree particularly on nuclear because every single operational nuclear power plant in this country be start by conservatives will offer some suggestion for question that labour member might like to ask they like to say that renewable be cheap and they be cheap to operate after all wind and sunshine be free however if we want to know what type of power will do to our bill we have to look at the full system cost if we race ahead with renewable at the same time as make our gas power station uninvestable what will be our back up when the sun do not shine and the wind do not blow and how much do that cost the system new technology such as small modular nuclear reactor carbon capture and battery of long duration storage be all welcome but they will not be ready by what will be use and how much will it cost will the large nuclear expansion in year which set out be sacrifice to pay for gb energy know that ministers barely refer to it any more but nuclear will be critical to our energy supply in the year ahead have they make an assessment of how much their plan will increase our reliance on the current dominant provider of pylon cable battery and solar panel which be china if not when will they do so how much private investment into the energy transition will they lose through their plan to tax the north sea into oblivion and ban new oil and gas licence it be not coincidence that many integrated energy company in this country pursue both oil and gas and renewable project at the same time it be because they use the same skill supply chain and worker industry say that more than billion be at risk from these plan gb energy at billion will not touch the side of replace that how much will be lose and where will the extra money come from will it be from central government through people taxis or will it be through the bill and standing charge of all our constituent the government keep claim think the minister do so today that gb energy will turn profit believe he say that every single project will make return but the slice of the pie that they want to invest in be the slice that even business do not think they can make money from that be what de risk mean member should ask on what basis the secretary of state think that he can turn profit for the british taxpayer when highly experienced energy company believe that they can not if be to give one piece of advice to the minister it would be to do what do when first start the job he should not listen to just one side of the climate lobby who pretend that there be no cost involve in this transition but go to speak to industry and to oil and gas worker and listen to how much those family value secure well pay job on their doorstep he should not follow the secretary of state path of quote only from the climate change committee and never from business or industry the minister job first and foremost be to keep bill down and the light on he should not forget those last two priority or he will find that those on the benches behind he will turn very quickly the right hon lady say that member should not quote only from source that they feel be friendly to they so will not quote from the international energy association but perhaps she might accept quote from the world economic forum which state renewables be now significantly undercut fossil fuel as the world cheap source of energy accord to its report thank the hon gentleman but as say we have to look at the full system cost he be very experienced in the energy sector and he know as well as do that the flexible capacity that be use to back up an intermittent system be where the true cost lie it be fair for opposition members to ask for an assessment of what those cost will be and what they will mean for british bill payer the other area where the government must be honest with the public be about what they be go to build the secretary of state first week in the job see he approve football pitch worth of solar farm on farmland in rutland suffolk cambridgeshire and lincolnshire those project be not sit on my desk as the secretary of state have claim have make decision to reject sunnica on the basis of scathing examine authority report and change policy to protect our good agricultural land these be not project that be likely to be approve these be bad decision work be be draw up to be announce but the decision have be take in the case of sunnica the secretary of state will know that from civil servant who be duty bind to brief he honestly in the department in the case of mallard pass the site have be sign off of which will be build on our good and most versatile agricultural land take no notice of legal planning guidance that say that good agricultural land must be avoid the secretary of state and his ministers will have to justify that and many more decision to his new colleague many of whom now represent rural community and whose constituent will be rightly concerned that they be next wish the new minister well for his time in the department the energy sector be one of the most interesting and important policy brief affect this country and it be in all our interest that he do his job well however what the government have do so far make claim during the election that they can not stack up now they be in government will just not do they have set out hard target to decarbonise the grid by and the secretary of state stake his entire political reputation on it without be honest about the cost these issue be far too important for government not to take seriously and they be far too important for labour members to follow the government blindly without ask question they do that during the election with promise to save household and they can no long stack up those promise just three week into government humbly suggest that this be their first lesson of the parliament they should not give the secretary of state blank cheque again it be great pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker and wish you all the very good in your new role it be great to be ask to speak first so thank you it be total shock it be an honour to speak in this debate as the member of parliament for newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend as we have thriving offshore sector along the tyne to use the word of the secretary of state it be time for britain to build thing again and my constituency be open for business the uk have lot to be proud of in its service sector but it be catastrophic error to have let manufacturing in this country decline to cite the title of report by the institute for public policy research manufacturing matter the conversation around manufacturing and service in this country be often binary it be one or the other but the reality for other country be far from that importantly the ippr report point out that while we have lose over one third of our manufacturing strength since the country like the us and france which be similarly service focusse have maintain their manufacturing strength at level productivity growth in manufacturing be five time high than in service between and high productivity mean high wage in good well pay job job that want to see in newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend and which match the aspiration of my constituent do my hon friend agree that these year of conservative government have be miss opportunity we have be ship in component for wind turbine that could have be manufacture here for example we need the industrial revolution that labour government will deliver indeed we certainly need to seize the moment now our determination in this place to raise living standard for work people must be unwavering and good job have their role to play in that the past year have see unprecedented level of wage stagnation resolution foundation datum show that wage return to pre financial crisis level only last year that decade and half of lose wage growth have cost the average worker more than year think that there be one nation tradition among those on the opposition benches an element of the conservative party that care about raise living standard for the bad off but after year the tories have leave we with two nation one rich one poor as we try to unpick the mess that the labour government have inherit the growth of green industry will be an exciting part of the way forward be thrilled that company see the opportunity that newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend have to offer be bring job to the region in the process the expansion of green hydrogen be just one example of that during recent visit be amazed at the ambition of geopura hydrogen project at siemens energy in byker where it produce hydrogen power unit to replace traditional diesel generator that be an example of the private sector at its good the sharp mind come together to solve some of the big problem that we face be proud of the breadth of the energy and offshore sector in my constituency that include the area oil and gas industry which have understandable concern about its future we need to think exceptionally carefully about how we shape the sector in the come year for work people who earn their living from oil and gas the hon lady and have work together closely on some of these issue do she accept as do that the climate change committee say that in even when we have reach net zero of our energy will be meet by oil and gas it be so important for our energy security that we produce that oil and gas here in the uk that be exactly what the company be tell and as member of the former all party parliamentary group on oil and gas know it have often be say the people work in these industry be worried about how their life will change if they be not able to adapt to new industry these be important job in our community where sweeping job loss be still in people memory in newcastle upon tyne east and wallsend it be not uncommon to speak to people who be affect or know someone who be affect by the de industrialisation of the the closure of the pit shipyard and factory ruin people faith in politic and the economy for generation the offshore energy sector include independent oil and gas producer large integrate energy multinational renewable energy company and supply chain that we need to keep here in the uk that include company in my constituency such as baker hughes and peterson which operate right across the uk and indeed the globe these company have the vision and ambition which we all share to deliver home grow energy transition and net zero almost billion will potentially be spend over the decade but the company invest in nascent opportunity such as float offshore wind and carbon capture and storage will require the cash flow from stable and predictable oil and gas business to fund these opportunity welcome labour manifesto commitment to manage the north sea in way that do not jeopardise job however would be grateful if the minister could set out in practical term how he will safeguard important job and investment in community like mine britain potential to become clean energy superpower be not only exciting but necessary as the government accelerate this journey urge ministers to ensure that no one be leave behind call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be genuine pleasure to see you in your new role madam deputy speaker also welcome the new under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks to his place look forward to much more constructive way of work compare with what happen under previous energy ministers the race to net zero be the major economic opportunity of this century the green economy must sit at the heart of economic growth and the government have work to do to rewrite the damaging narrative of the previous conservative government that this be about green versus growth and to remedy their unforgivable failure that delay block and even reverse urgent action on climate change now be the time to move forward the global market for net zero technology be estimate to be billion year by we must use britain unique geography and abundant natural resource wind power and the world second large tide to consolidate our position as green economic powerhouse community benefit community buy in and individual economic incentive be critical to make this reality bath and west community energy in my constituency be put people at the heart of the energy transition and place the ownership and control of energy in local hand it raise million from nearly member and bondholder and it have donate back to the community for local food production recycling project and fuel poverty programme yet community energy be not mention in the labour manifesto imagine future in which people can purchase clean energy directly from local supply company or co operative and in which every pound spend on power our home or car be recycle back into the local community support job fund new facility and service and contribute to renewable energy infrastructure that be what community energy be about ensure that people everywhere support and benefit from the clean energy transition the big barrier especially for small project be the cost of access to the grid there be regulatory challenge too but surely the creation of great british energy should include the opportunity to realise the enormous potential of community energy it be often local council and grassroots project that show the great ambition to get to net zero until now local authority have be hamper by lack of resource and lack of co ordination between central and local government even within central government the co ordination of net zero strategy have often be fragment we liberal democrats therefore call for net zero delivery authority both to devolve decision make power and resource to local government and to co ordinate all net zero strategy and decision making across central government departments the last energy crisis which see household bill in the uk spiral out of control be exacerbate by the uk reliance on fossil fuel ironically the previous government do very little to accelerate the deployment of renewable onshore wind be de facto ban and the target for the roll out of solar be regularly miss only by fast expand renewable energy not just offshore wind and prioritise radical home insulation programme can we ensure that family will never again be severely out of pocket to fully realise the potential of renewable the government must address our outdated national grid nearly gw of electricity from offshore wind project be currently await grid connection hear that that be now to be accelerate that would have be sufficient to power million home some developer have be wait for up to year there be no shortage of capital or will to invest but delay and rise cost have deter investor who see project in other market such as mainland europe as safe return on investment know that the government be all over this but be set out what the failure of previous government be significant new infrastructure be require to connect renewable energy from where it be generate to home and business across the country but the government must pay close attention to the community host the require infrastructure know that be challenge but support the government in understand that significant infrastructure can not be delay because we really need to get to net zero totally agree about the need for new infrastructure germany be now pursue an underground first approach to new energy transmission infrastructure rather than overground pylon do the hon lady agree with and other opposition members that the uk government should adopt that approach indeed we have have westminster hall debate on that very subject and absolutely agree save private company money be no reason not to do something that be well for community half the time it be all about what be affordable so agree that there be very fine balance to be strike but where other solution exist than have big pylon that ruin the landscape national grid should look at they the hon member claim that labour manifesto do not mention community energy in fact statement from community energy england say labour local power plan would turbocharge community energy and local climate action it be an integral part of the labour party manifesto be only mention how important community energy be to liberal democrats the labour manifesto do not seem to have as much emphasis on it but if we agree on it hurrah we all win the hon lady be be generous in give way on the issue of undergrounde power line although that may in some case be necessary for community do she not accept give that it be time the cost that it be possible to screen the power line and in do so create biodiversity corridor that can connect biodiversity from one part of the country to another so that biodiversity can cope with climate change indeed there be not easy answer to all these question we need to look at the fine balance of cost versus get community buy in there be go to be transformation of our landscape and we need to be aware of that we must also make good case for why it be urgent that we get to net zero and in my view that balance in the argument be not strike properly by the previous government it be important that community buy into our big landscape transformation but it be also important that we do this at an affordable cost for the whole of the uk we liberal democrats be call for all new home to be net zero immediately it be crazy that we be build home today that will need upgrading in few year time we be propose year emergency upgrade programme for home start with free insulation and heat pump for those on low income that will not happen without incentivise private landlord and have tough energy efficiency target the private rental sector have the most energy inefficient home nearly half of household live in these property be in fuel poverty but local authority have take limited action to enforce minimum energy efficiency standard whether it be tight regulation on private landlord or further sanction to ensure that they comply the government must put their mind to the private rental sector we will ensure that energy efficiency for rental be not brush under the carpet that include incentive for the private rental sector from discussion in the previous parliament know that the labour party be relatively reluctant to give money to private landlord but without incentivise the private rental sector do not think that home insulation programme will happen particularly for low income family urge the government to think about that as well as landlord business must be incentivise to invest in the green transition the turning of the conservative government spark immense distrust from industry with the uk chair of ford warn that her business need three thing from the government ambition commitment and consistency that be exactly what they must deliver year of stop start investment have leave the energy sector reel business and trade organisation have long be call for detailed plan of action that offer the clarity and certainty that will make the uk an attractive country to invest in hope that this government can finally deliver the certainty that the country so badly need climate change be happen but every cloud have silver lining seize the economic opportunity of net zero will help we spread wealth and opportunity to every corner of the uk from insulate home to provide thousand of new job in the energy sector it be clear that everyone can benefit from thriving green economy look forward to work constructively with the new government to combat climate change reduce energy bill and be leader in the journey to net zero due to the large number of maiden speech and the fact that want to get everybody in be now impose six minute time limit with the exception of maiden speech call jess asato thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your elevation to the chair it be such great honour to be in this place my thank for that must of course go to the people of lowestoft beccles and the village who put here they have place their faith in to do what be good for they to be their voice here in westminster and to champion they nationally and they have place their faith in the labour party to lead government worthy of this great country to do away with the decline of the past year and work to bring about bright future for all as begin my role in make that happen would like to pay tribute to my predecessor peter aldous and his contribution to east anglia position as green energy leader his defence of our local fishing industry and his campaigning for the waspi woman women against state pension inequality campaign thank he for his many year of public service and wish he all the good for his future also pay tribute to his predecessor bob blizzard who very sadly pass away in he serve the people of my constituency for more than year in local government and in parliament and his decade long fight for third crossing will see its fruition with the opening of the gull wing bridge later this summer finally must mention dame tessa jowell my mentor who be much love and be much miss would not be in this place if she have not encourage to follow my passion for change in her maiden speech she implore member to always ask themselves whether what they be decide be what they would want for themselves or for their family official report may vol aim to channel her dedication to public service and as she call it the human sized picture each day that have the honour of represent the people of lowestoft in this place for politic be personal grow up near lowestoft be young carer for my grandmother and manage our precarious life on benefit as child the daily struggle face be my normal but it should not have be not for any child that be why join the labour party year ago know that when we be bold we bring real and lasting change such as the introduction of sure start know that when we be focused we can eliminate the barrier to success we can make people aspiration more than dream we can pull child out of poverty represent the most eastern constituency in the uk and for many people there it can at time feel as though they be at the end of the line not just on the railway map but when it come to political priority if politics be not about make those at the periphery central it be nothing we have fail if our focus be only on those who be most visible to this place my job and the mission of this government be simple to bring those who have not be serve well by politic back into the fold prove to they that politic can work for they that it can be force for good it be job that be relish and one that be deeply humble to be able to do lowestoft be special place to represent with incredibly friendly people and our wide sandy beach and beautiful broad which be real hide gem that recommend colleague visit we be home to some great sight for the thrill seeker there be pleasurewood hills arguably the uk good theme park africa alive for those want taste of safari without leave the country fascinating maritime and transport museum the majestic somerleyton hall and whatever the weather beccles lido indeed member look to book their next holiday should contact my office however that beautiful scenery and the really close sense of community we find in place such as mine have be let down talk to constituent over the past month hear the same issue again and again people be disgust by sewage in our river and the sea they be concerned about the lack of flood protection and about coastal erosion not least because of the devastating impact of the flood in lowestoft and the precarious nature of home on pakefield cliff threaten by the sea most worryingly they be concerned about feed their child quarter of child in lowestoft be grow up in deprivation and people have have to turn to lowestoft food bank in the past year one of the most pressing issue for many resident be access to nhs dentistry we be serious dental desert investigation find that not single dental practice in suffolk be take on new nhs patient meet one constituent while canvass who tell that he have grow so feed up with the pain with no obvious remedy in sight that he have pull his tooth out with pair of plier in his garden shed think we can all agree that that be not state of affair we want to carry on with labour promise increase in emergency dental appointment will be huge relief for local resident and incentive for dentist will be crucial to attract they to work in dental desert such as mine our plan to introduce supervised toothbrushing in school will also be essential for child future oral health make sure that all child be able to seize all of the opportunity in life challenge childhood inequality and importantly address childhood trauma be central to my vision for politic be incredibly proud of my record outside of this place campaign for woman and child alongside life change charity such as safelives and barnardo but know that be on the outside could only do so much that be why be here to stand up for vulnerable people and to make sure that our coastal town and rural community feel the benefit of labour in power that be why policy like gb energy be so important they mark break with the failure of the past they demonstrate true ambition and commitment to right many wrong when the question be ask how do we make britain clean energy superpower my answer be lowestoft my answer be by unlock our capacity to grow our offshore wind the partnership announce yesterday between gb energy and the crown estate represent massive step forward for the country and huge opportunity for my constituent from lack of housing to polluted river and sea and from high energy bill to antisocial behaviour and much more this government have set their sight firmly on the issue that matter to people in lowestoft beccles and the village be very glad to support they in that it be delight to welcome you to your new position madam deputy speaker which be sure you will fill with great aplomb as you have do other position that have see you in over the past few year in this house congratulate the hon member for lowestoft jess asato on her maiden speech it be very interesting to hear about her background in the charity sector her tribute to former member who be inspiration to she and who have pass away be very moving know in what high regard tessa jowell be hold particularly by those on the labour benches it be also very nice to hear her tribute to peter aldous he be calm and quiet man in some way but he be also very kind man who really do stand up for his constituent on many of the important issue that she mention he will be miss by those on the conservative benches one of the first thing that do when be new member be try to speak to constituency neighbour from other party those conversation can be incredibly helpful and revealing and can ensure that you work together on local issue that should really transcend party line speak just yesterday with the hon member for north durham luke akehurst who have take an area of my former constituency hope the hon lady do that and take advantage of the all party parliamentary group one of my good baptism be with the hon member for neath and swansea east carolyn harris who be superb on the appg for gambling relate harm we work together cross party with mps from northern ireland the liberal democrats and the snp so urge the hon member for lowestoft to delve into the appgs she give fantastic maiden speech thank you very much for call to speak madam deputy speaker want to touch on couple of point that have be raise already and then touch on few local issue for my constituent as well as make slight mention of couple of national issue the previous government record be clear we start with of our electricity come from renewable source and end with that be good move for the long term interest of the country however as the committee on climate change say and as mention in an intervention there will still be need for oil and gas in the long term in our country there be manufacture base for deliver that which often work symbiotically with our manufacture base for new offshore wind really hope that the government think about and recognise that when it come to our energy security do not want our country at the mercy of foreign power urge they to really think about the impact that not press ahead with new oil and gas in the north sea be have on constituency particularly in the energy heart of our country around aberdeenshire in scotland we will require it so think that be mistake sort of understand politically why they might have go for that but really urge they to think again in the national interest since there have be over billion of investment in our energy sector from the private sector whatever we do it will be private sector lead the relatively small investment figure that the government have be talk about have be reflect on just urge they to ensure that whatever happen be private sector lead and deliver the really good long term job and growth for the country that we have be talk about and have secure over the last few year want to pick up on few thing that the government have say my right hon friend the member for east surrey claire coutinho mention the year but the minister do not cover that could he provide clarity on that issue it be something that constituent up and down the country will think about the minister talk about community own energy company similar to great british energy there have be experience of that there be robin hood energy in nottingham which end up cost taxpayer huge amount of money in the long term be interested to know whether the government be invest in the bit that the private sector will not invest in how can they guarantee the return that the minister be talk about and how can they guarantee that the policy will not cost taxpayer more in the future as former member of the public accounts committee do not want to see when look into this in few year time that taxpayer be leave on the hook when the private sector would not step in on the overall cost of the net zero plan in the run up to the general election the labour party drop its commitment to spend billion year on move towards the target really could do with clarity from the government on the figure that they be look at give that in the month precede the general election shadow ministers talk about it potentially cost hundred of billion of pound to get to that target as mention in an intervention on the liberal democrat front bencher the hon member for bath wera hobhouse on energy infrastructure the impact would be on community such as billericay burstead and laindon in my constituency where there would be foot pylon right down the centre of an area of unspoilt countryside really would ask the government to reflect on that particularly as germany be move to an underground first approach if the germans can do it do not see why we can not it be in the conservative manifesto be the right hon gentleman aware that in july steve holliday the then chief executive of national grid say on the record that go underground be no brainer it be report widely in various newspaper as be his say that when national grid be require to go underground such as when go through an area of outstanding natural beauty it just do it this require government to be muscular with private organisation and to insist that they use the technology that they can order remind the hon lady that intervention should be brief the hon lady make an incredibly important point as technology develop it seem remarkable that we be not look at go underground as sensible solution she be absolutely right that it can and do happen think that it be question of make it happen the government seem willing to ride roughshod over local consideration ask they to take little step back and just try to take community with they we get the first second third fourth and fifth large offshore wind farm in europe deliver under the last conservative government obviously infrastructure be require for those but the government have to take community with they want to be able to back new renewable that be sensible thing to do particularly in the offshore wind sector that be why we see under the last government renewable energy go from to however we can not ride roughshod over local community urge the minister as he take this policy forward to consider the impact across the country call polly billington to make her maiden speech thank you very much madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your elevation it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden constituency much close to mine than the one that he represent previously first of course it be right to pay tribute to the fortitude and resilience display by my immediate predecessor craig mackinlay who represent the old seat of south thanet he demonstrate extraordinary strength of character when face with life change injury as result of sepsis his return to this house when mr speaker permit members to applaud be unforgettable know that he will use his elevation to the other place to promote his various passion now include well prosthetic for amputee wish he and his family well craig be immediately precede by my good friend laura sandys although laura take her seat for the party now sit on the opposition benches she and have work together on range of issue not least the importance of tackle climate change and the opportunity that transition to clean and renewable energy offer in help we to tackle social and economic injustice if she be still in the house she would have lot to say in this debate before she the south thanet seat be labour for year it be hold by dr stephen ladyman minister of state in the last labour government who be able to effect real change for his constituency and beyond with his work as health minister and also in the department for transport where he secure the transformational high speed rail service to thanet as result the three town that now make up my constituency margate broadstairs and ramsgate become highly accessible to the rest of the country and that accessibility be both new thing and constant characteristic of the story of this beautiful place much be say in thanet about from londons of whom be unashamedly one as though this be new phenomenon but it be tradition that go way back new arrival mainly but not solely from the capital have make their home in thanet recently as the pandemic have change work pattern and the train link have make commute more possible but people have be come down from london to enjoy the sea air the sandy beach and the stunning sky of thanet for more than two century turner start trend that run to this day margate can argue that it be in fact the first seaside resort working class londoners take sea packet down the river and stay over in margate often only for night to fit in with the strict holiday limit before the trade union secure proper weekend for work people in that tradition will be proud to vote for well deal for worker when the time come despite this strong working class tradition and the fact that labour hold its party conference in the town after the second world war when clement attlee be our prime minister the boundary change mean that be the first ever labour mp for margate from chas and dave to carry on margate have be home or escape for some of england good entertainer john le mesurier and hattie jacques live there and eric morecambe hold his wedding reception in pub in the old town margate be now the home of the world famous turner art gallery which have drive the growth of vibrant art scene support by tracey emin and involve the margate art school and open school east yet as in so many place across the country many people be lock out of access to the art either as maker or consumer that be something that we can and must address as government and as community in east thanet my good friend the artist bob and roberta smith resident of ramsgate campaign tirelessly on that and welcome the government approach to the school curriculum which will mean that all child can experience art in all its form ramsgate be town steep in history with the only royal harbour in the country gracious house build for naval officer in the napoleonic war rare georgian church with chapel dedicate to the hero of the evacuation of dunkirk and ramsgate tunnel which be place of refuge for hundred of people during the second world war thank to the ramsgate society and the town resident there be blue plaque where van gogh paint where wilkie collins write and where coleridge recuperate it be also where the architect of this place augustus pugin build his home this history deserve to be more widely know and celebrate include the story of ordinary people access to understand the fullness of our past be crucial to shape our future ramsgate be also home to publicly own port which host range of company and service from the border force and the royal national lifeboat institution to the wind farm that generate enough electricity to power more than quarter of million home wind farm own by another government however not ours look forward to work with my right hon friend on the treasury bench to ensure that great british energy enable not only more energy to be generate but job to be create and supply chain to be develop in thanet and in place like it where high quality job be in short supply and renewable energy source commonly know as sunshine and strong wind be plentiful this amazing climate mean that broadstairs be synonymous with holiday for many but the reality be that its economy like that of the rest of the constituency be affect profoundly by the sewage scandal as one business owner explain to no one want to paddle through poo it be priority for and the government to tackle the sewage scandal which have not only environmental and health implication but economic implication for east thanet what thanet need more than anything be year round economy that will require something that so many town need include that of my hon friend the member for lowestoft jess asato as well as beccles and the village and that be coastal community strategy that address the challenge face by constituency such as mine and make the most of what these amazing place have to offer for all of the way in which thanet be unique my experience here and elsewhere in the country tell that as ever we have more in common than that which divide we thanet share challenge with many other coastal community poor healthcare creak bus service housing crisis partly drive by unregulated short term holiday let shock crime statistic blight high street and few good job opportunity it share opportunity too renewable energy heritage stunning natural asset and the creativity and determination of the people who live in our coastal community whether bear here or draw here people value thanet unique character it be one of our unify characteristic like many before have choose thanet and be honour that it have choose feel able to ask the voter of east thanet to have as their mp because it be place where can walk safely and freely in town hand in hand with my wife that be precious and special thing thank you thanet for have may not have the wit of chas and dave the timing of eric morecambe or the vision of turner but will serve you as well can call pippa heylings to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your new role also congratulate the hon member for east thanet ms billington with whom work before we both come to this chamber through and elsewhere on local climate action which will speak much about today also congratulate the minister and the secretary of state for energy security and net zero it mean great deal to to make my maiden speech during debate in which the new government be set out green energy policy and plan to get we back on track with our climate pledge here at home so that we can once again contribute on the international stage towards collective global action close to home government research show that local climate action would achieve net zero for half the cost of the national approach and deliver three time the financial return but we need clear framework between the national and the local and for how council fit into the national plan for net zero include community energy initiative let say how proud and humble be by the faith the resident of beautiful south cambridgeshire have put in they want change and this be truly historic result the liberal democrats win all three cambridgeshire seat turn they from blue to yellow for the first time form golden ring around the constituency of the minister of state department for environment food and rural affairs the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner congratulate he on his appointment as the minister for farming we have golden ring or rather golden doughnut with red jam in the middle and it be thank to family friend and activist many of they here today that that happen be lass from hull whose dad be gp and mum nurse from an early age accompany my dad on his home visit to patient and it be those root in the nhs that foster in deep sense of community service as well as an insight into the link between inequality child poverty and poor health outcome that be why be proud that the liberal democrats put the nhs and social care at the forefront of our campaign after year of conservative chaos and neglect leave the nhs on its knee will continue to campaign to get fair funding for our gps in cambridgeshire because the unfair funding formula in cambridgeshire be leave gps struggle to keep their head above water inequality be cruel determinant in the covid pandemic and lead to many avoidable death south cambridgeshire help avoid more it be here that the quick deciphering of the covid virus genetic code allow for the vaccine to be develop straightaway that partly explain why they be available in record time the researcher then continue to detect the variant as they emerge it be truly lifesaving that be part of the reason why semi rural south cambridgeshire be fast change it be now home to world lead innovation with europe large biomedical centre and the wellcome genome campus as well as more than start up and business most of which be small or medium sized enterprise our world lead tech and life science sector be among the big contributor to the country economy and invite the government to recognise that they be the goose that lay the golden egg which be why their future need to be shape carefully with and through the local authority give local people voice and tackle affordable housing the water supply transport and grid infrastructure gap in way that allow community business and nature to thrive that be why would like to pay my respect to my predecessor anthony browne who work hard to raise those issue he support the call on government to tackle the water crisis and look forward to continue his work support the campaign for the new cancer and child hospital too also pay tribute to his predecessor heidi allen who be still remember fondly by many resident sadly heidi stand down from politic as result of the abuse that many mp mainly woman face in her word of course public scrutiny be to be expect but line be all too often regularly cross and the effect be utterly dehumanising heidi have become an mp to stand up for the vulnerable and for those who have no voice now more than ever want to continue their work by help to ensure that there be positive and inclusive vision for all in south cambridgeshire where no one be leave behind it be distress that of child in my constituency be live in poverty with increase number dependent on food bank and free school meal isolate in village with no public transport this inclusive vision must include our unique and precious chalk stream that connect we our blue vein the silvery thread weave together our village we have the granta that twinkle through stapleford linton and balsham the river shep that start in fowlmere nature reserve and flow through shepreth and barrington village the river rhee that flow through haslingfield and harston the mel that rise in melbourn and flow through meldreth and the fulbourn and wilbraham chalk stream resident be rightly outraged at the dumping of raw sewage in these stream and river urge the government to get tough with the water company together with the government will champion breathe new life into the chalk streams protection bill have work professionally for many year with government around the world to integrate climate and nature into growth plan mediate agreement where benefit can flow to local community what motivate most be how young people see their future recent study on young people find that too many have climate anxiety their most use word be fear anger frustration and worry there be two main reason why they feel this way first they do not think that decision maker listen to they and secondly they think that decision maker do not care or take the right decision for their future have meet many young people in south cambridgeshire who feel this way and they want action on the twin climate and nature emergency speak to they now want what we do in this chamber to restore your faith and give you agency so that together we can be the change that we want madam deputy speaker congratulation on your elevation today we stand on the brink of new era for our country with the recent announcement of an historic partnership between great british energy and the crown estate that will usher in billion of pound of investment for clean power this landmark collaboration will be defining moment in this new government mission to make britain clean energy superpower highlight by the introduction of the great british energy bill to this house share the concern of many in this chamber that for too long family and business have to endure sky high energy bill that be due to mismanagement and exposure to volatile international market great british energy will be own by british people and fortify with billion of new investment it be position to drive clean energy deployment across the united kingdom promote job creation energy independence and economic revitalisation the formation of great british energy signify definitive break with the past steer we towards our ambitious goal of clean power by the crown estate with its extensive billion portfolio and newly enhance investment capability will synergise with great british energy strategic oversight this will enable up to billion in private investment and ensure that the benefit of our home grow secure energy will be feel across our nation from urban area to rural community it be essential that we collaborate with the private sector which will allow we to amplify our renewable energy capacity to double onshore wind triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by this broad base investment in renewable energy represent an investment in our future energy security and independence this ambitious plan will not only produce cheap power for our constituent but ensure that profit be reinveste back into our community the creation of great british energy mark critical step towards generate clean energy cut energy bill and deliver good job particularly at time when our constituent be grapple with the consequence of previous government failure which lead to an energy insecurity crisis have serve on the energy security and net zero committee since its formation strongly believe that accelerate our investment in energy infrastructure be critical initiative such as the green prosperity plan will create hundred of thousand of new job in clean industry by this plan be vital to secure british leadership in the global clean energy transition be sure that my hon friend the minister be proud that great british energy will be headquarter in scotland ensure that every corner of our united kingdom play critical role in this green revolution alongside the lifting of the onshore wind ban approval of significant solar power project and the establishment of mission control head by chris stark yesterday announcement underscore our government commitment to secure britain energy future furthermore the government plan to impose windfall tax on the record profit of oil and gas company will serve as financial leveller it will redistribute excess profit and ease the public burden the transition to renewable energy must be meticulously plan and execute in this context the burning of woody biomass for electricity present substantial risk to our clean energy future the government need to reconsider subsidy for large biomass generator such as drax and lynemouth power station which under current subsidy arrangement could significantly undermine our carbon reduction goal investigation have reveal that drax the uk large emitter of carbon have be involve in practice that be environmentally unsustainable and counterproductive to our objective extend the subsidy could result in an increase in carbon emission and burden bill payer with high cost the government must heed the advice of independent body such as the climate change committee and the national audit office by ensure that any future subsidy be conditional on sustainable practice that will promote the use of local waste biomass over import material furthermore an equitable transmission away from north sea oil and gas remain crucial despite year of drilling those resource be deplete and can not meet uk demand increase domestic oil and gas production would not alleviate high energy bill or enhance energy security as global market force determine those price by end new oil and gas licence and speed up the adoption of renewable energy we solidify our position as world leader in climate action order call greg smith add my congratulation to you on your new role madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to follow the hon member for preston sir mark hendrick and equally congratulate all those who have make their maiden speech in this debate in particular join the hon member for east thanet ms billington in pay tribute to craig mackinlay who be superb member of this house as he make his transition from be the bionic mp to be the bionic peer think speak for the whole house in wish he well on today subject matter want to be clear from the outset that we absolutely have to decarbonise and we absolutely have to defossilise the challenge lay down to our great innovator and scientific mind be enormous and those great mind be rise to the challenge from electricity generation to the fuel of the future but that be also why be so frustrated by an approach to clean energy and clean fuel from government that always seem to favour the first but not necessarily the good or most sustainable solution for the future let start with the controversial topic of solar since be first elect in the threat of large scale solar development have cause significant concern for many of my constituent across my constituency and part of my former constituency now represent by other field after field and farm after farm have already be blanket by solar panel to the detriment of the surround community food security nature and landscape food security be national security yet before any of we who be elect on july have even swear in the new energy secretary have sign off acre of solar installation later admit in his statement week after that land use strategy be yet to come we simply can not have this language of community consent when the decision that be take walk all over the view of the community so badly affect small stand alone solar be less impactful quick and easy to install do not risk damage the local infrastructure and provide an additional reliable source of income for many struggle farmer it be not just the panel that consume vast amount of our countryside the infrastructure need to carry the electricity generate through to the grid swallow up yet more it be no coincidence that adjacent to the propose rosefield site in my constituency battery storage facility be be put forward in the ultimate manifestation of the tail wag the dog national grid have come along and propose another huge land take essentially to rebuild the east claydon substation next door let that be warning to any community where solar be come it do not end with the panel solar have its place but that be on our rooftop and not our field research by the wonderful charity campaign to protect rural england find that there be potential for gw of renewable energy to be generate from rooftop and other exist develop space in england we should be prioritise that and not lose our agricultural land my solution have always be to propose nuclear as the option and to look at small modular reactor have give this statistic in the house before but will do so again we need around acre of solar panel to generate enough electricity on current usage and before everybody have two tesla on the drive for home by contrast just two football pitch be require for small modular reactor that will power again on current usage million home fail to see how anyone can look at those two compete land use and choose solar over the small modular reactor it be simply not good use of land to turn our farm into solar let move to another clean energy that be particularly passionate about and away from electricity generation to the future of fuel the united kingdom be already an international powerhouse in the field of synthetic and sustainable fuel with company such as zero petroleum innovating right here and international company such as fuels make huge investment in bring the manufacturing of fossil free fuel to the united kingdom it be straightforward fact that there be billion internal combustion engine vehicle on the road worldwide and that be before we start count agricultural and construction vehicle plane ship and so on they be simply not all go to convert to electric as some argue that they should green hydrogen mix with atmospheric carbon capture make wholly man make liquid hydrocarbon that work in everything we already have after more than century refinement on those engine and this clean fuel will just work in they on the point about synthetic fuel be it also the case that for several type of vehicle such as incredibly heavy vehicle or those that need to travel incredibly long distance there be no battery option and synthetic fuel as an alternative be exactly where we need to go my right hon friend be absolutely right certainly for heavy application vehicle battery just would not work see diagram at one of these company that show that if we be to try to make fly on battery the battery would be big than the plane therefore that be not viable option go forward synthetic fuel be entirely man make there be no need to grow food to burn or recycle old chip fat or for raw earth mineral mining for battery it be just clean synthetic my ask to the government as they look to clean energy future that be the right ambition where we disagree be on how we get there be that they truly embrace synthetic fuel and make they mainstream they need to be scale and in order to be scale manufacturer need confidence that the government will permit that an important point to finish on be that the carbon at tailpipe when these fuel be burn be the same volume that be then recapture to make the next lot of fuel they be net zero it be one volume of carbon in perpetual circle congratulate the minister on his appointment and ask he to take the message back to the department that we

ask in this house apart from how to pronounce the name of my constituency be how manage to travel from westminster to the western isles of course the easy answer be by tardis but the honest answer be that here we be mere hop and skip away from glasgow and then travel by small jet on schedule hopefully to stornoway as board that small tubular jet feel almost like character in succession but know that there be gold at the end of the flight of course we be connect we be not in the middle of nowhere but at the heart of the atlantic we have the wealth of wind that will deliver the benefit of job growth and energy security for this country in year to come those atlantic island and the western seaboard be what will give gb energy meaning and reality in that transition from east to west away from the north sea and away from the myth that we will not be there in another two generation two generation of my constituent have earn energy security for this country from the north sea and two generation more will continue as we make that just transition to renewable that will be do with the heft of two government the uk government and the scottish government and will require the muscle

office community land unit enable community to have the mean and wherewithal to take over their own land set in chain the land reform revolution in the highland and island be encourage that this labour government be open to idea such as community energy unit to enable community such as mine to take their stake in that wealth of wind and create template that can be use across the whole of britain these be theme to which will return alongside the unfinished business of land reform read today that highland estate be for sale at million with carbon capture and the ponzi scheme of peat restoration attach and know that that be unfinished business of course wild weather and radical land politic be not the only thing that the western isles have to offer the united kingdom there be deep

barra the jewel of the hebrides be where angus macneil the former mp for na eileanan an iar reside fior ghaidheal true gael and generously spirited man whose chairmanship of many committees in this house be testimony not just to his political acuman but to his ability to befriend people across the chamber that be one characteristic of my predecessor that hope to emulate will not take the house

an additional seat in the east of england as native east anglian it be an honour to be able to represent such wonderful constituency span such beautiful part of norfolk and suffolk hope that other hon member who be no doubt equally proud of their constituency will indulge for few moment as try to give they sense to what it mean to from its vibrant market town with lot of independent business on the high street to the beautiful natural environment of east anglia with the waveney and several other river run through it waveney valley be fine example of picturesque and historic east anglia the ancient market town of diss be mention in the domesday book bungay have norman castle the town of eye and halesworth date back to roman time and harleston date back to the medieval period create constituency that span the county border of norfolk and suffolk be consider controversial by some but personally think it be an exciting opportunity to embrace cross county working and much of the constituency reflect natural community around the waveney that say there be one contentious question that some people put to which football team do support be proud to be lifelong norwich city fan but in football as in politic be not tribal and warmly congratulate ipswich town on their recent promotion to the premier league for the first time since it be great thing for east anglia and very much look forward to celebrate have two premier league man football team in east anglia this time next year what really make waveney valley special be its people people who care about their community who like have strong sense of local identity and who demonstrate great ingenuity and care for their community could cite many example of that ingenuity whether from farming the third sector or local business but to give just one example the indoor marketplace in diss open last year in former department store it be community initiative give local trader affordable small space to sell their craft and good in share space lovely boost for the local economy in building that would otherwise have sit empty what great example of regenerate the high street people in waveney valley be rightly proud of our market town and village but they also feel let down by the loss of local service and the degradation of our environment in recent year and decade which have particularly affect our rural community as have be note this week we have the sahara of dental desert official report july vol one of my constituent tell that they make four hour round trip to access dentist over quarter of the resident survey over the winter say that they be go without dental treatment and like the hon member for lowestoft from whom we hear early have have example in suffolk of people tell they have resort to pull out their own tooth this can not go on and welcome the new government commitment to reform the dental contract which be the root cause of this issue and of the exodus of dentist from the nhs hope to hear timetable for that plan as soon as possible we have also see decline in other health service in my rural constituency people find it hard to get access to gp appointment in many area we have have local hospital close in market town and we also have rural isolation with so many bus service ax or cut back particularly in village at the same time we have the scandal of sewage in our river which the hon member for south cambridgeshire pippa heylings speak about so eloquently and which know so many member across the house feel extremely strongly about people be horrify by this threat to people health and to wildlife and they rightly see it as sign of wide environmental neglect very much hope that the restoration of nature and tackle the sewage scandal be make top priority by this government whether it be on the grow use of food bank people suffer from flooding or the decline in our service want to see real action that genuinely account for the need of our rural community because of their anger about the loss of local service and the decline in our environment people in my area be determined to vote for change at this election they be use to have green councillor stand up to represent they and they vote for an mp to stand up for their area will press for the restoration of local service and the defending of the local environment it be my intention to serve the people of waveney valley by seek to bring people and place together will work across political and constituency line to get thing do scrutinise and constructively challenge the government and work to improve the life of my constituent as many other hon member have say we have an opportunity with this new parliament to put our politic on more mature and civilised footing and move beyond tribal approach and be confident that that be what the public expect of we have have thousand of conversation with local resident over the past few year and know that they want an active and visible local mp be determined to fulfil that role to be waveney valley voice in westminster and not westminster voice in waveney valley would like to set out how be approach an issue in east anglia that have attract lot of interest from some right hon member and the medium have be climate campaigner for year that have be my primary passion since be teenager and make difference on climate and the environment have guide everything that have do in my career include spend the last decade lead national charity whose purpose be to support the renewable energy sector be the first to argue that we need to scale up all type of renewable energy and there be much in the minister speech to welcome if we be to scale up renewable energy at the pace require to tackle the climate emergency we need to take community with we and make infrastructure decision that be right for the long term what have call for in relation to the infrastructure proposal that be currently on the table for east anglia be proper option assessment of the different way in which the energy generate by new wind farm in east anglia be connect to the grid today have hear two hon member from two different political party from mine refer to the fact that there be different way in which we can connect that renewable energy to the grid think that simply call for an option assessment be very reasonable approach be also call on the government and the planning process to account for the point raise by wildlife trust local council and community about the impact of the current infrastructure proposal the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have set out that there be planning process to be follow which the government should not prejudge and the prime minister have say that he want to reset the tone on the political debate something very much welcome in that spirit ask that we move beyond some of the comment that have be make in this chamber on the particular infrastructure proposal that have refer to that the government commit to work with community to ensure that infrastructure decision be make in way that properly account for the issue raise by wildlife organisation and local community and genuinely look at the option that different member be highlight and that if version of the current proposal do go ahead the mitigation propose by organisation such as mid suffolk and babergh district council and the wildlife trust be properly take on board and full compensation be put in place that account for the impact on farmer livelihood and on other affect on the wide subject of today debate welcome the creation of great british energy and much of what the minister share in term of scale up renewable energy politely point out though that to get to net zero we have to move away from fossil fuel as well as increase renewable energy to that end would ask the government to place strong emphasis on energy efficiency measure the minister refer to home insulation but what have hear so far will only scratch the surface of the home insulation measure need to keep bill down and home warm also urge the government to reconsider the rosebank oilfield which will have carbon emission equivalent to low income country and to ensure that carbon capture and storage project be never allow to be an excuse for million of tonne of carbon pollution have two other point on climate first with significant climate change already happen around we or already lock in as result of emission to date far more public policy attention need to be give to how we adapt to change climate as well as to mitigate the bad excess of climate breakdown we need to look at those thing together and look forward to return to this issue on another date secondly the decline of climate and nature must be see as equal and twin problem stand ready to work with those from across the house to shift the uk from be one of the world most nature deplete country to get on track to meet environmental target include on nature recovery it be an honour to be here to represent the people of waveney valley have set out my guide principle as member of this house which be to stand up for our rural community for the restoration of public service and for the most vulnerable in our society and to press for the urgent action need on the twin climate and nature emergency will play constructive role in this house by support the

glasgow south west journey in pollokshields an area my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner know well it be true melting pot of culture and idea and the place where my father one month road journey from pakistan end in april he would go on to drive bus in the city and then black cab he be in his and he still do in the undergrowth of this rich history and potential however there be some worrying signal there be the weariness of work ever fast and long just to stay still the anxiety of wonder how secure that work be and the trepidation at the end of day of work that you may not be able to pay for the odd treat that make life worthwhile or even the essential it be against that backdrop that we on the labour benches be send to this place to make the economy work for work people and to restore the intergenerational covenant the promise that the life of the generation after we will be well in every sense than our own politic for be not therefore about the indulgent

in power the discipline to deliver endure change that have always be the labour way every member elect to this place recognise it for the singular honour that it truly be but it also take village to

british talent lewis hamilton it be safe to say give that king george vi have be the only reign monarch to attend british motor race that would love to extend the invitation to his majesty the king choose this clean energy debate for my maiden speech because it be an important issue that will have big impact on my constituent while there be no doubt that we need to look at renewable and diverse energy source for our future energy security destroy thousand of acre of prime agricultural land can not be the solution to this ongoing question in our area we have already see the solar farm application make at greatworth and now the green hill solar farm propose for location near grendon and the surround village in my constituency would take over acre of productive farmland and convert it to solar panel and associate battery storage the fact that the government have so quickly in matter of day sign off proposal for over acre of solar farm be of great concern to because of the precedent that it will set scheme like this will jeopardise our food security and scar our beautiful countryside when there be other sensible solution we should be look to industrial rooftop and transport corridor at minimum the minister talk of community benefit but there be no engagement with the community who have to live alongside and with these panel it be case of marry in haste repent at leisure disagree with the government approach to this matter lead to mention one of my key priority for my time in this place firmly believe that in all our debate we can disagree agreeably and that be message advocate during my election campaign discussion nowadays be too polarised too black and white and far too hostile we need robust debate and discussion and we need to take the heat out of difficult issue so that we can reach the good resolution want to ensure that we adopt fair and balanced approach see both side of the issue but settle on that which resonate most and that be always my promise also want to be champion for those with hidden disability such as diabete have myself be give the shock diagnosis of late onset type diabete just three year ago understand the difficulty of adapt to life with hidden condition technology have enhance our quality of life but it be still difficult to access that technology and want to help in whatever way can and to champion this cause as lady may have over the year one upside be that will always be carry some form of sweet for low blood sugar so member know where to come if they be in need before end my speech want to take moment to

across the whole country improve from sport and culture to trade and enterprise this government will turn struggle into hope and hard work into real opportunity have see the difference that have opportunity make be particularly happy this week to address group of young people from north ayrshire who have be inspire by parliament education centre and by the chance to stand as an mp in this place just hope that not too many of they will do it soon think that represent the uk around the world be the good job could have have but represent the family of central ayrshire will be the privilege of my life thank you madam deputy speaker and welcome you to your position congratulate the hon member for central ayrshire alan gemmell on his first contribution to this house it already sound as if he have make huge contribution to the uk around the world and be sure his constituent be look forward to he act for they will begin by echo the word of my hon friend the members for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson and for south northamptonshire sarah bool about the impact on agricultural and rural land of the government plan to cover they with cable pylon and other energy infrastructure the sheer concentration of this infrastructure on prime agricultural land in community such as new deer maud turriff and leylodge in my constituency and the apparent lack of ability for community to engage in meaningful discussion on this will in no way bring the public along on this crucial national endeavour however be go to focus on the key issue for my constituent and those across north east scotland and that be the oil and gas sector the job expertise and investment that we will be put at risk if the government rush towards their green energy agenda no matter how much the minister may wish otherwise we can not and will not have green energy revolution without the exist oil and gas sector its skill and crucially its funding the company that make their money from oil and gas development now be the key investor in our renewable energy sector and carbon capture project that be undeniable we must make the uk an attractive place to invest in all energy in order to attract and keep multinational company here and to keep they invest here in the future we have to draw only very short line to realise that if we dismiss alienate and penalise the traditional oil and gas part of energy company the board of those same company will turn their back on the uk for more sympathetic and attractive investment opportunity elsewhere we would lose not just the current investment in oil and gas but the potential for investment in renewable energy do the secretary of state for energy security and net zero or the minister expect that we will have stop use oil and gas by of course not so why be we ban new oil and gas licence and cut off our own domestic energy supply why be the government happy to see ten of thousand of home grow job put at risk and why be they happy to increase our reliance on import of oil and gas produce with high carbon footprint from more volatile market overseas if there be reason other than simply to fulfil their narrative of be green energy superpower be yet to find it the uk thank largely to aberdeen and the north east have long be an energy superpower an oil and gas superpower that status build over half century have lead to the energy sector skill expertise company and workforce be hone and house in north east scotland not just the subsurface and technical skill of the like of geologist and engineer but crucially the expert in supply chain those will be vital to the renewable energy project of the future our worker in the oil and gas sector know how to deliver huge multinational high budget project exactly the skill that will be need to deliver the government green energy revolution again the government risk lose those crucial skill by move too fast and not plan for job and skill transition alongside the energy transition labour idly call the investment allowance aspect of the windfall tax loophole and plan to remove it and increase the tax rate to indeed it boast about do so yet there be estimate that the combination of no new licence and change to the windfall tax will cost billion in tax revenue and risk up to direct and indirect job last year the leader of the gmb union say that labour plan to end new oil and gas licence be self defeat agree do my hon friend agree that while windfall taxis can be levy on oil and gas that be extract in the uk we will not get those revenue for decade if we do not have oil and gas exploration in the north sea we will see windfall taxis go to foreign government across the world but none come here do she agree that it make no sense at all for job in scotland or for the uk exchequer not to have oil and gas exploration in the north sea absolutely agree it be so important for all those reason for job and future tax revenue that we retain our domestic supply of oil and gas alongside the leader of the gmb call the government plan self defeat the former leader of aberdeen council quit labour last year say its plan be brutal attack on the sector again agree just as rome be not build in day the experience and expertise of the oil and gas sector the energy sector do not develop in day however the vital skill and investment that we will rely on to deliver the transition to clean green energy will be lose in no time at all if the government do not listen appreciate they and act to protect they the warning sign be there and we must not ignore they without the exist workforce the energy transition will take long be more expensive and be less efficient truly an unwanted trilogy for any government call david baines to make his maiden speech be

beecraigs and polkemmet country park the kinneil local nature reserve and the shoreline at and blackness be never far from stunning and tranquil countryside we must seek to protect and preserve this natural beauty for future generation key to this be our effort to reach our net zero target and combat climate change which be cause significant damage to our environment but let we be clear that our natural environment also have key role to play in achieve our goal so it be in our interest to do all we can to protect it with the passion and commitment show by the secretary of state for energy security and net zero and his team ably represent today by the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks and the ambitious plan that they have set out include on support for community energy project which welcome as co operator be confident that we will leave legacy for future generation to enjoy our landscape also tell the story of our industrial and manufacturing heritage from the shale bing across the constituency and the former brickwork and foundry to the former british leyland site plessey semiconductors now whiteside business park and the pyramids business park which once house motorola the people of the bathgate and linlithgow constituency have always embrace change and technological advance the constituency have highly skilled and flexible workforce with opportunity attract worker from across the central belt include the glasgow overspill which be still refer to as such today despite many live in the area for almost year recall my first visit to aldo chippy in bathgate when the lady behind the counter recognise my accent ask if want salt and vinegar rather than salt and sauce which be topic of heated debate between glasgow and edinburgh colleague of course the correct answer be salt and vinegar however the story of the constituency have not always be one of prosperity this year mark the anniversary of the miner strike and the subsequent closure of polkemmet colliery after the pit pump be switch off flood the gallery the smoulder slag heap have be remove and new house have be build as part of one of the big regeneration project in europe but the town of whitburn and the surround community be devastate with many family endure severe hardship the mistake of the past must not be repeat lesson must be learn about the impact of such loss on individual on family and on entire community that be why support the fight to keep grangemouth work and to keep the job on which many of my constituent rely particularly in and linlithgow thank my hon friend on the front bench for their proactive approach to work towards sustainable future for the site also thank my hon friend the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman who have be steadfast and vocal in his support for the campaign while we honour our history and the tradition of the past we look to the future with hope and ambition we be situate at the heart of scotland with easy access across the central belt via the and and rail route to our great city and beyond with the unfortunate exception of winchburgh which still await its train station more people be choose to live in the constituency and more company be choose to locate there to do business include in manufacturing technology communication logistic retail and hospitality tourism also drive our local economy particularly in the royal burgh of linlithgow with the royal palace set aside the loch and the peel st michael church and its newly refurbish crown of thorn the union canal the historic canal basin it pass through and other treasure there be plenty of reason to linger long in linlithgow in we have the steam railway museum the motor museum the restore hippodrome theatre and numerous place of interest we be also see growth in tourism as result of the increase in tv and film production in the area the blackness bay distillery set in the picturesque village of blackness be one example it be benefit from the increase in visitor to the castle as result of the success of outlander can tell those who have not visit yet that they will receive the warm of welcome from sheena and colm at the distillery also want to mention the major historic house attraction of kinneil house hopetoun house and house of the binns the ancestral home of the dalyell family as place to visit as labour and co operative member see the opportunity to expand the co operative economy put power directly in the hand of local people for the benefit of local community look forward to work with fellow co operator to do just that although job and opportunity be on our doorstep too many people still face barrier to employment and many be not earn enough to get by that create huge demand on local food bank and other vital support service include those offer by our local third sector organisation which do tremendous and invaluable job child poverty be scandal that blight community across the country and in my constituency but it do not exist in vacuum low pay high rent high mortgage exorbitant energy bill and the rise cost of food all contribute to severe financial pressure on family that be why welcome the announcement of the child poverty taskforce which will bring together voice inside government and those of outside expert to take holistic and targeted approach to tackle this scourge and ensure that every child have chance to achieve their goal irrespective of their background with more people choose to live in the bathgate and linlithgow constituency we be see increase pressure on vital local service which be significantly underfunde as well as pressure on gp surgery and on our local infrastructure both the avon gorge junction and the burghmuir junction be in serious need of upgrading with under investment in bus transport at scottish level our more rural community such as greenrigg newton philpstoun bridgend torphichen westfield blackridge seafield and even the town of blackburn be struggle to keep connect it be crucial that investment in vital service and local infrastructure keep pace with development and that be something that will champion in my constituency as young girl grow up in the small village of lennoxtown at the foot of the campsie hill never do think that would be stand here in the house of commons as one of female mps the high ever number of woman representative that do not just happen we be here only because of the woman who forge the way for we such as the incomparable harriet harman who have the pleasure of meeting for the first time at last year edinburgh festival it be empower to see so many incredible labour woman take their rightful place on our front benches their example will let young girl today know that they can be here one day too while the increase in woman member to of this place be hugely welcome we still have much work to do to achieve representation as councillor work to remove barrier to participation do my bit to ensure that council chamber start to reflect the community that we represent pledge to continue that work with hon member in and across this chamber finally think most people here would agree that our politic have be mire by division and scandal in recent year and that have undermine public trust in politician we have duty to restore that trust which be key to our democracy in scotland there have be far too much finger pointing with representative retreat to their respective trench and endless constitutional debate that ultimately deliver nothing for the people of scotland welcome the new approach of work with the devolved government and the response from the scottish government on issue such as the tobacco and vape bill and hopefully uk wide deposit return scheme this relationship reset will be far strengthen by the new council of nation and region which will facilitate return to constructive engagement and co operation in the interest of the people we be all here to serve for my part will work with hon member in this place and with elect representative in all chamber to deliver for the people of bathgate and linlithgow my constituent have bestow their faith on and for that thank they it be responsibility that will carry every single day and pledge to be the champion and advocate they need and deserve it be my pleasure to follow the hon member for bathgate and linlithgow kirsteen sullivan congratulate she on her eloquent and passionate speech and particularly on her call for gender balance be sorry to tell she though that her use of the native tongue appear to have bring the hon member for na eileanan an iar torcuil crichton back to the chamber whether that be to congratulate she or correct she be not quite sure move swiftly on the area that be privileged to represent have be at the heart of the uk energy production for year and more and it be now poise to be at the forefront of renewable energy revolution frankly we could and should be much far along the road to energy transition but we be where we be the government have say that they want we to become clean energy superpower but regret that they have scale back on their original ambition to invest billion in order to realise that goal nevertheless hope that they will chart pragmatic and constructive way forward the journey to net zero be well under way in scotland with estimate suggest that the renewable sector already support around job the uk though be behind schedule when it come to invest in the infrastructure include the grid infrastructure that those project will require the unrealistic pricing of contract for difference have hold back the development of offshore wind the new government need to address that issue with the same urgency with which they be move on other matter the north east of scotland have be the european capital of oil and gas for many decade now we have the opportunity to be the net zero capital we have enormous potential to capitalise on offshore wind generation and the development of green hydrogen these be time limit opportunity especially as we have ambition to develop lucrative supply chain as well as technology and manufacturing that have significant export potential in the long term that would be the prize for our economic future want to impress on ministers today the case for bring the hq of gb energy to the north east of scotland just look at map the bulk of offshore renewable production will be within mile radius of aberdeen the port that will be essential to service the sector most notably peterhead and fraserburgh in my constituency be on the east coast close to the moray firth there be also important potential role for small port we already have workforce with relevant skill and unrivalled experience we also have the most to lose accord to research publish last year by robert gordon university around one in five job across north east scotland be in the oil and gas sector do not want to see repeat of what the thatcher government do in mining and steelmake community across scotland and elsewhere perhaps as much as of skill in oil and gas be crossover skill we must support that crossover successive uk government have use the north sea as cash cow some billion flow into the treasury coffer in but there have not be great deal to show for it in aberdeen city or aberdeenshire in term of infrastructure or investment in that crucial transition hope that can change go forward as we debate the need to address climate change improve energy security and deliver fair deal for consumer it be important to acknowledge the reality we will continue to need oil and gas for some time to come many of we be still use gas to heat our home fuel poverty be very real high standing charge and cold climate be brutal combination that push thousand upon thousand of household into energy poverty most of we still use car that run on petrol or diesel in area like mine where distance be great public transport be more limited colder winter temperature mean electric vehicle work less well and the use of traditional vehicle be accentuate our reliance on fossil fuel be fall but it be not about to disappear oil and gas will continue to be part of our energy mix for some time which be why it be important that ongoing production be in line with climate compatibility criterion and be manage in way that do not lead to premature winding down of production in the north sea however the current fiscal regime for north sea production have create very real and present risk it have the potential to cost thousand of job and saddle the treasury with cumulative decommisioning cost ask ministers to look at the impact that the energy profit levy have have on job and productivity consider the role of the energy security investment mechanism and acknowledge the importance of investment allowance why because the fiscal regime in the north sea be hold back investment in energy transition we need to recognise that north sea operator be in many case those who be make the big investment in renewable if the government really want to unlock the potential of the renewable energy sector they need to work with those who can invest on the scale require and over the necessary timeframe and who already have an experienced expert workforce at their disposal would welcome the minister comment in his sum up on the government plan for fair fiscal environment across the energy sector will make one final point on carbon capture and storage we need to press on with project such as the acorn project at st fergus precisely because they be cut edge and have tremendous potential to create new technology knowledge and expertise we have globally competitive subsea supply chain in the north east of scotland we excel in develop solution to technical challenge we see challenge as opportunity and we seek to be leader in innovative new technology there be the potential to deliver fair energy price for consumer improve energy security and help we to meet our international climate obligation the north east of scotland and community in my constituency in particular will be at the centre of the change ahead urge ministers to make good on their promise and deliver manage and just transition for those worker and community on the frontline call douglas mcallister to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to make my maiden speech to the house in this debate on make britain clean energy superpower congratulate you on your elevation it be privilege to follow the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan who always speak with great eloquence and

people have be displace from their home the previous government continually pour fuel on the fire of the climate crisis entrench our reliance on volatile international market but this government have plan to totally turn the corner our journey to become clean energy superpower be not only an environmental imperative but chance for economic growth and to address the cost of live crisis while make britain energy independent that be why welcome the government plan to launch great british energy publicly own company fund by make big oil and gas pay their fair share from the incredible windfall they have be receive this initiative demonstrate strong commitment to cut carbon emission and embrace renewable it be crucial step to lower our bill through zero carbon electricity system it be so important that we ensure that this step be co ordinated work with new initiative such as skills england to ensure that across the board we be increase training opportunity especially in key area such as maritime apprenticeship which will help with our offshore wind effort it be also incredibly important that we unlock the potential of community energy which have vast untapped potential for small scale renewable scheme that could be own and operate by local community build that resilience into our community directly realise that potential would bring clean affordable and secure energy to local people very much look forward to work with the front bench team on these issue and support the bill as it make its passage through this house congratulate the minister on his appointment call the opposition spokesperson welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker and congratulate member from across the house on their wonderful maiden speech have minute of praise for they highlight every aspect of their wonderful speech but unfortunately time be limited so shall have to give quick analysis of praise for they all be secretly delighted that do not have to try out my scottish know it be sad but true that might be for the next debate it be wonderful and heart warming to hear from hon member across the house from east thanet to every part of scotland include the highland and glasgow south west and from south northamptonshire and with all member care about their local community and represent all the people who matter and who elect they that be what matter in this place feel that now be an expert in all thing scotland never have be so afraid to talk about and name everything than when have to do burns night toast hope that someday can visit all those wonderful constituency it make realise that scotland be very inclusive diverse and wonderful place and would like to sample the whisky and the hospitality from loch lomond to the highland praise all hon member here today be someone whose contribution often make people think gosh that an unusual beaconsfield accent so be always delighted to hear sparkle speech from voice less grating than my own it be nail on chalkboard and you adjust over time celebrate the diversity in the chamber during today debate we hear some superb maiden speech from labour members and so many of they even be confused about who be the new labour mps that be how many of they there be so congratulation welcome the minister to his position he will definitely be go far and my claim to fame will be that get to debate with he first here in the house he be also scottish mp and welcome he and congratulate he on his ministerial position be also pleased to be shadow department lead by fellow london school of economics alumnus but disappoint that the secretary of state be not here to respond to or open the debate know in what high regard he be hold by the labour movement his high ideal and socialist principle be in the very good intellectual tradition of his party but he be now in government and fear that the change he want to bring about will make work people poorer and put our energy and food security in the hand of russia and china in just three week as my hon friend the members for mid buckinghamshire greg smith and for gordon and buchan harriet cross and my right hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr holden point out the secretary of state have ignore local community he have ignore planning professional he have ignore sound decision making and he have ignore basic economic he seem to be in race to deliver high bill and high taxis for work people and poor less safe britain will the hon lady give way will give way in moment but must make little progress first because have only five minute if be to allow time for the minister we on the conservative benches will keep call these plan out for what they be dangerous experiment that will damage the british countryside wreck the livelihood of hard work british people and drive up energy bill let we examine the progress of this experiment so far during the election campaign the secretary of state get labour candidate to claim that gb energy would save on energy bill but that do not seem to be something that the government be go to stand behind now would ask why that be and what plan there be for the future in this regard the government have form an energy company that will not generate single watt of energy and will not bring down single energy bill they have take billion of taxpayer money and put shiny brand on it call gb energy gb energy be simply the government subsidise high risk project for the private sector on one hand while decimate our oil and gas industry with the other they have set up new company and claim that it will make profit in five year with nothing but page of hot air found statement with no business plan no financial forecast and nothing else be the shadow minister not aware it be exactly that negative narrative from her party that have hold we back on the path to net zero know that the hon member be strong advocate for her local community and that be an important cross party awareness but we be in this position now and say to the government you win and we be here to hold you to account on your new endeavour we wish you all the good but it be our job to hold you to account if gb energy be private company no investor would touch it with bargepole yet the government get to play with the money of hard work british taxpayer while simultaneously hit they with high taxis and high bill in return for that privilege the secretary of state doubtless think that he be courageously save the planet but he be not quite courageous enough to go to aberdeen or to be here today or to speak to those in the north sea who will lose their job this be now serious it be serious because the government be write cheque that the british people can not afford and ministers will never have to pay it be serious because they be betray the trust of local community it serious because they be put at risk our energy and food security at time when both have never be more vital and it be serious because those who will suffer for their net zero purity be work people these be not plan for clean energy superpower they be plan for weak poor britain with the leave of the house madam deputy speaker will respond to what have be very wide range and until that last speech mostly positive debate thank all those who have contribute and have bring we their idea and their huge experience not just in relation to the green energy transition but in relation to everything from the care system and child poverty to vital matter of public discourse such as what we should put on our chip that be raise by my hon friend the member for bathgate and linlithgow kirsteen sullivan and for the record what she say be absolutely right want to say something about the maiden speech that we have hear today because it have be genuinely incredible to sit on the front bench and listen to they all the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey say moment ago that they have give she quite lot to reflect on have odd page of note here on those wonderful maiden speech but have only minute in which to sum up it be not so long ago that give my own maiden speech less than year ago in fact and the same trepidation that have when stand up then be with now have to say on reflection that be glad be the only person give maiden speech after by election because this field of maiden speech be just little too good they be fantastic the house often come in for criticism for no long be the place where we take the moral course or talk about the high value of public service but in every single one of those maiden speech from every part of the house we hear the real dedication of member to their community and the passion with which they want to fight for those community think that this parliament the parliament of will do huge amount to change people life will turn now to the substance of the debate but will come back to some of the maiden speech if have time in her opening remark the shadow secretary of state say that the conservative party can be proud of its climate record and in so many way if we be to go back year she would probably be right but the rhetoric that we be now hear from this conservative party be million mile from that david cameron conservativism that say we should take the environment seriously language in this matter be important it matter that we talk truthfully when we speak about the opportunity and risk it matter too that we do not conflate issue when there be no ground for do so wish to pick out just few thing from the debate today the shadow secretary of state and number of member raise the issue of bill have sit and listen to those contribution do wonder where some member have be for the past few year there can scarcely be member in this house who do not know of the thousand of people up and down this country struggle in fuel poverty and the million who be still face high bill the reason that we be on this journey be not because of some sort of ideological commitment to net zero but because we know that it be the only way to deliver the energy security that we need to reduce our dependence on volatile gas price and to deliver the cheap energy that we know will bring down bill the commitment that we make throughout the election have not change in the slight we will bring down people bill in the long term to avoid those shock that have cost people so much in their household bill in what think be great speech the hon member for bath wera hobhouse point out that this can not be about growth versus green which be really important the two go hand in hand it be key part of both our economic strategy and our environmental strategy that we move forward she also make the point about co ordinate across government which be also important it be why the prime minister himself be chair these mission board so that we can bring together all department of state and internal and external voice to drive forward the change that be need across government on the oil and gas transition the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross and for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan who be perhaps not surprisingly on the same side in criticise this government make number of point about the north sea which be important and which take on board very seriously none the less the suggestion that the north sea be go to close overnight be nonsense and it have to stop be peddle by member across the house because it create unnecessary uncertainty there will be decade of work in the oil and gas industry in the north sea whether or not we issue new licence and as have be mention the skill the experience and the infrastructure that be vital for net zero transition be important that be why we need to start the just transition now it be why we should have start it year ago frankly we can not simply bury our head in the sand and hope that the economic reality of the future will be the same as the past the north sea be decline as an oil and gas basin we need to tackle what the future of that look like now on the issue of scaremongere the various contribution that have touch on solar could mark really worrying change in the discourse that we be go to have in this house if we carry on the way that we be the genuine question about planning be important and it be right that members of parliament be robust indeed would be myself as constituency mp in the defence of their constituent on these issue none the less there be such thing as nationally important infrastructure which be important for the whole country say that there be go to be food insecurity because of these solar project be incredibly dangerous language from the opposition indeed the national farmers union respond to some of that scaremongering say that solar farm do not in any way present risk to the uk food security solar farm make up less than of the land use in this country even if we reach the target that we want to get to they will still make up tiny amount of our land use and they be an important part of our energy infrastructure accept that the figure at the moment be but the volume of solar application come forward literally every week in my constituency alone mean that the cumulative impact will be hit to food security gently ask the minister to look at the project number for the future not what we already have rise will the minister give way will make some progress because have only four minute if have time will come back to the hon lady the hon gentleman have repeat the point about food insecurity despite just say what the national farmers union which think be an expert on this topic have say about it he have also make point about the amount of infrastructure in one give area which be why it be really important that we co ordinate that infrastructure much well than we do at the moment that be why the spatial energy plan be so important the previous government commence that work and we will continue it because we need holistic view of all this energy infrastructure so that individual community do not become saturate with one particular type of infrastructure however say gently to all hon member that at some point we have to accept that some of that infrastructure be nationally important and will have to be sit somewhere even if we have offshore cable that infrastructure by its very nature have to come onshore at some point there will have to be recognition of the need for infrastructure in community but take the point about the importance of it be well plan will the minister give way will first give way briefly to the hon member for bristol central carla denyer the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith raise concern about solar threaten our ability to grow our own food in this country respectfully suggest that he check out the recent research by exeter university which show that we could increase the amount of renewable energy we generate in this country time over use believe less than of the uk land and none of the high grade agricultural land order call the minister that be helpful contribution and thank the hon lady for it even if we reach our solar target by it be very small amount of land that would be use for what be an important part of our energy infrastructure number of other point be make in this debate that underline how complex some of these decision be go to be but also the huge opportunity we have number of member speak about the industrial opportunity that will come from this green transition and number offer up example from their own constituency relate to the role of skill which be go to be so important the sense that this be the mission that we need to be on together as country be also important because it will take all of we with all of our expertise and the challenge that come from the opposition to make the right decision so that we can have long term plan that deliver the net zero future that we need before sum up will return to some of the maiden speech in particular take advantage of be at the dispatch box want to highlight my colleague from scotland who have be return to this parliament who make some fantastic speech it be brilliant to hear my hon friend the member for na eileanan an iar torcuil crichton speak in gaelic during his contribution which be fantastic be disappointed that more of our lobby colleague be not in the chamber to hear he do that but be sure they will catch up the point he make about the importance of involve community in this future be also make by number of hon member that need to take two part it need to be consent and consultation but it also need to be recognition of what the reward for those community should be there be number of option because not all community be align on what they think that reward should look like but it be go to be critical part go forward there be number of quote that will look up in hansard my hon friend the member for na eileanan an iar talk about be season with salt which be wonderful my hon friend the member for glasgow south west dr ahmed speak about see the world through the long lens have the discipline to look at some of these difficult challenge public priority and recognise that some of the benefit of what we be do now will not be see in the next five or year but it be none the less important to start the work be something that we in this place can all bear in mind to conclude since the summer recess be fast approach could not help but notice that as result of all the maiden speech we have produce something of our own staycation guide as we have go around the house very quickly will just mention my hon friend the member for lowestoft jess asato the lido and the safari the turner art gallery in east thanet barra the jewel of the hebrides with its whisky and salmon in na eileanan an iar the norman castle in waveney valley bellahouston park in glasgow south west which know well one of becket miracle fantastic be go to see the hon member for south northamptonshire sarah bool about that and also because now know that she be the one in the chamber with sweetie which be very helpful and the open championship in central ayrshire my hon friend the member for central ayrshire alan gemmell have the privilege of represent the constituency that be bear in and he make wonderful speech today will also mention aldo chippy in bathgate dumbarton castle in west dunbartonshire and the delight of be burn as an effigy in lewes thank the hon member for lewes james maccleary for conclude the debate with the second that have leave thank all right hon and hon member who have participate in the debate hope that this be the first of many for they and that there continue to be genuine exchange of idea across the house question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the matter of make britain clean energy superpower pharmacy provision hampton motion make and question propose that this house do now owatemi may start by congratulate you madam deputy speaker on your election it be pleasure to see you in the chair also congratulate the minister on his appointment we have work closely together in recent year in the all party parliamentary group on kinship care so have no doubt that he will do an excellent job suspect that young lyle be very proud of his granddad right now be delighted to have secure this adjournment debate you might be surprised to learn madam deputy speaker that this be the first have manage to secure since my election in so want to use this exciting opportunity to bring to the minister attention the impact of pharmacy closure on the local community in the hampton area of my constituency as well as the immense financial challenge face community pharmacy right across england will also raise concern about the impenetrable bureaucratic process which need overhaul in new pharmacy licence application and pharmacy closure let set the scene last autumn two boots pharmacy in the hampton area be close one of those pharmacy be in the hampton north ward one of three ward of relative deprivation in the london borough of richmond upon thames the west of the ward be within the most deprive area of the country it be densely populate with significant amount of social housing as result of that closure in tangley park the entire ward be now without community pharmacy hampton north be poorly serve by public transport there be no station and the two bus route serve the area be notoriously unreliable the near pharmacy be now mile away on foot distance that be difficult to cover for the elderly and those with mobility issue it be certainly more than minute walk away which be the measure that previous ministers like to use to highlight pharmacy accessibility predictably those closure have put lot of pressure on the near remain pharmacy which face queue and stock issue again that be not exactly convenient or practical for elderly and vulnerable patient at this point pay tribute to mike derry and healthwatch richmond for their brilliant work champion local patient and give they voice healthwatch undertake survey of some resident in the hampton area at the start of the year to demonstrate the impact of the closure one person say have go without medication as can stand very long there be queue have wait over half an hour healthwatch england highlight the plight of year old gill she use to just about be able to get across the road from her house to the tangley park pharmacy now the near pharmacy be over mile away and gill who do not drive can not access that service because of the distance that she would have to walk to get there she even pay the near pharmacy to deliver her medicine to her home each month but in the eight month since she purchase the delivery service it have show up only twice her carer have to travel to collect the medication in person for she hampton be not unusual in lose pharmacy provision be sure that the minister be aware of the crisis face the community pharmacy sector datum from the community chemists association show that there have be net loss of over closure and only opening since more than third of those loss have be in the most deprived area of the country the national pharmacy association report that the number of pharmacy that have close so far this calendar year the equivalent of pharmacy week be nearly high compare with the same point in as well as independent pharmacy big chain such as lloyds pharmacy and boots have significantly accelerate closure number over the past month big driver of these closure be significant real term reduction in funding for pharmacy that funding have drop by around since be my hon friend aware of the issue of overwhelmed surgery refer increase number of patient to local pharmacist have see it in my lewes constituency do she agree that this will only contribute far to closure thank my hon friend for his intervention and congratulate he on his excellent maiden speech completely agree with he we want doctor to use community pharmacy more to alleviate the pressure on other part of the health service but frankly if the pharmacy be not there the remain one will be overwhelmed talk to local gps in the hampton area follow these closure and they be desperate to see more provision they think about try to set up their own community pharmacy provision but they just could not make the number add up because of the funding shortfall the company chemists association estimate an average funding shortfall of per pharmacy that be base on an analysis of datum publish by the department of health and social care in write parliamentary answer at the beginning of last year many pharmacist be leave out of pocket as they be reimburse less for number of medication than the price they pay and there be story of some use credit card and overdraft to purchase medication these funding pressure be couple with major workforce challenge when meet boot follow the news that it be close two branch in hampton it cite lack of pharmacist as major reason for close some pharmacy across the uk although commercial pressure be clearly the main driver layer on top of these issue be regular medicine supply shortage which add more work and create more stress for already overstretch pharmacist community pharmacy england report last year that of pharmacy be have to manage supply issue daily it be perfect storm for community pharmacy at time when we need preventive healthcare and self care more than ever the potential of community pharmacy to improve patient health and reduce the pressure on nhs hospital and gps be immense yet they be close in their hundred every year we should be rely on pharmacy even more to keep the nation healthy the previous conservative government announcement of the pharmacy first initiative be very welcome in its ambition but if pharmacy be not even fund for the basic right now with big gap in provision open up all over the country it be hard to see how pharmacy first ambition will be achieve the liberal democrats would like to see the government building on the pharmacy first principle and give pharmacist more prescribing right and public health responsibility as in so many area of public health the invest to save argument be compelling and look forward to hear the minister comment on what the new labour government will do on funding to enable community pharmacy to not just survive but thrive and grow as an essential part of our primary care infrastructure have address the cause of these closure will spend some time explore the process involve in local community be inform of pharmacy closure and their input or lack thereof in they as well as discuss the complete lack of transparency or accountability in relation to application for new pharmacy licence for starter only those organisation designate as interested party in the regulation be inform of new application and only their feedback have to be take into account anyone else who be interested such as as local mp need to make freedom of information request unless someone in the local health community pass on the information my view and the view of other people in the community can be ignore to describe the bureaucratic process that sit around new application as byzantine would be generous hope the minister madam deputy speaker and other hon member will bear with while try to explain what happen in hampton we be part of the south west london integrated care board but nhs england have delegate the pharmacy market entry function for the whole of london to the north east london icb which be on completely the opposite side of the city official have no local knowledge of our area no understanding of local transport link and no relationship with the local health system let start with the closure the minister will be aware of the statutory three month notice period for pharmacy closure last august boots would have have to give nhs england three month notice of its intention in hampton that information be not pass by nhse to the richmond health and wellbeing board find that utterly staggering the first that local councillor the local health community in the area and as the mp know about the plan closure be when boot place sign in its window to inform customer and concerned constituent start to contact about the likely impact of the closure at the end of august while this be go on and we be all in the dark the local health and wellbeing board publish pharmaceutical need assessment but it be inaccurate and fail to identify an imminent future gap in need in the hampton north area because it have not be notify of the closure the tangley park boots subsequently close in late october the priory road boots which be directly opposite busy gp surgery close in early november in november an application be receive for new independent pharmacy licence on the tangley park boots site once again the local health and wellbeing board be not notify of the application this time for two whole month during this period of complete silence the health and wellbeing board issue supplementary statement to the local pharmaceutical need assessment which identify the gap in hampton however because the application for new pharmacy be make in november and it refer to the original need assessment that be make before the supplementary statement be publish it be reject even though the application itself identify the gap which be officially make clear in the supplementary statement subsequently publish in december not only that but it take the north east london icb full eight month to issue the rejection tht happen early this month even though the decision use evidence receive in december to justify the rejection madam deputy speaker if you and other hon member be still manage to follow this sorry story hope you will agree that this decision be utterly perverse it be also utterly unreasonable that timely application to open pharmacy in response to multiple closure should be inherently prevent in this way the delay in share information with the local health and wellbeing board and the delay in decision making be unforgivable during the lengthy delay the local authority receive planning application to change the tangley park pharmacy site into fast food outlet thankfully that be reject early this month after representation from the public health team and councillor but be sure the public health minister will agree that it would be unfortunate to put it mildly if pharmacy be replace with fast food outlet one local official tell yesterday that the system architecture be too complicated and that there be need for clear responsibility and accountability amen to that say healthwatch richmond have demand answer from the north east london icb but it have receive frankly woeful response that do not address the substantive question of why the application be so badly handle the response pass the buck and blame regulation to be clear healthwatch and be not qualified to comment on the merit of an application what we be do be challenge the unfathomable process say to the minister that the huge funding challenge face community pharmacy be press appreciate that they may be extremely difficult for he to address give that the chancellor have an iron fist as far as any additional public spending be concern but the minister must wage campaign to improve the funding situation it make financial sense we will not grow the economy without improve the nation health in that campaign he will have cros party support from member on the opposition benches revisit the regulation and how nhs england be implement they will cost next to nothing there should be proper consultation with and involvement from the local community on closure notice and change in the process for new licence could ensure that we can quickly plug pharmacy gap when they open up in area such as hampton crucially those power need to be delegate to the local icb with full involvement from the local health and wellbeing board they know their community and their geography good trust they finally if the minister could step in on the specific issue in my constituency the application that have be reject and be go nhs resolution on appeal simply to ensure common sense approach the resident of hampton north and would be very grateful we desperately need new pharmacy for our community look forward to his response call the minister may start by welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker congratulate you on your election early this week also congratulate the hon member for twickenham munira wilson on secure debate that be absolutely crucial not just give the specific of the case in her constituency but for the precedent that it set as we plan community pharmacy provision across england assure she that although lyle miss out on his week in london for whitsun half term because somebody call general election he be on his way to london as speak with allison so that we can do london as tourist this weekend be respond on behalf of the minister for care my hon friend the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock who lead in this area start by pay tribute to pharmacist it be credit to they that survey show that nine in people who visit pharmacy feel positive about their experience colleague appreciate how accessible pharmacy in town and village across our country be but for too long government have fail to recognise their essential role in safeguard the nation health not least in my constituency of gorton and denton this government know that people who work in pharmacy be highly train specialist and we be committed to help pharmacist and pharmacy technician reach their full potential pharmacy already provide vital advice on prescription over the counter medicine and minor ailment but they do not just dispense medicine and proffer advice important though that be they must do much more than that many already offer blood pressure check flu and vaccination contraception consultation and treatment for the seven condition cover by the pharmacy first service support pharmacy first when be in opposition as think the hon lady do and my party pledge to build on the programme by make prescribe an integral part of the service deliver by community pharmacy for that reason in the next two year we will ensure that every newly qualified pharmacist have prescribing qualification while we train up the exist workforce this year nhs england be work closely with all integrate care board on pilot to test how prescribing can work in community pharmacy because like the hon lady we want pharmacy deliver service that help patient to access advice prevention and treatment more easily service that ease the pressure on general practice and in other area in the nhs and service that unlock the knowledge and expertise that our pharmacist have to offer this government take the view that pharmacy can and should play an even great role in provide healthcare on the high street that be why we stand on manifesto that promise to shift resource to primary care and to community service over time community pharmacy will play an important part in move our health service from hospital to community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention but we have only be in office for three week this can not happen overnight and colleague have be absolutely right to raise concern with ministers about the closure of pharmacy as we speak well over pharmacy in england be dispense medicine offer advice and deliver care and despite closure access to pharmacy remain good across most of the country four out of five people live within minute walk of their local pharmacy but as we have hear in this really important debate that be not the case everywhere in the country know have listen to the hon lady that in twickenham it be high than four in five but in other part of the country it be below one in two in the most deprived part of england there be almost twice as many pharmacy good thing than in the least deprived but we need well access across the country to take the example of my own constituency where access to pharmacy be fairly good almost the entire population be within minute walk from pharmacy however in certain rural area and in grow number of urban area because of the closure programme that be not the case in those rural area there be dispense doctor who can supply medicine to patient and patient across the country can access around distance sell pharmacy that deliver medicine to patient home free of charge it be true that experience vary depend on where people live but be aware of the specific problem in hampton follow the closure of the two boots pharmacy that she describe on the point about the minute walk and the four in five statistic do the minister recognise that minute walk for or he be actually much long for an elderly person or somebody with multiple health condition or mobility issue we have to work out what measure we be use yes the twickenham constituency may have many pharmacy but we must look at that highly localise level that be why we need the local authority and local health board to be involve because actually in hampton as community the transport link be terrible completely understand the case the hon lady be make ask she please to understand that she be push on bit of an open door it be completely different subject but have have exactly the same argument about bank closure in my constituency be tell that as long as the near bank branch be half an hour away by public transport that be acceptable unfortunately computer say no when it be two bus that do not meet up in between agree with she that there be complexity around draw up arbitrary limit but generally access to pharmacy be good we need to maximise the use of the pharmacy network so that we get more pharmacist come in welcome the government support for strengthen the pharmacy sector the minister talk about the workforce resident in my constituency have raise concern about the pressure on pharmacist to take on more and more service that might traditionally have be provide by primary care what assurance can he give that he will make sure that the workforce plan for pharmacist be robust enough to cope with the extra demand we be very committed as hope the hon lady know to the workforce plan be as robust as it can be so we do not just get the pharmacist of the future but the doctor nurse healthcare worker and so on too on the journey to national health service that be much more community focused and much more align to prevention rather than to cure sickness we want to prevent people from become ill in the first place we must ensure that at its heart be how we can deliver medicine and treatment close to where people live have well train capability in the pharmacy sector to do that be very much priority for this government return to the issue of the two boots closure in hampton the minister for care be aware of the closure he ask to communicate to the hon lady the fact that he will keep very close eye on what be happen on the ground in her area on the hon lady specific point about bureaucracy assure she that the regulatory framework be always under review and as new government we be keen to make improvement wherever we can be sure that my official will have hear the case that she have make after the hon lady kindly reach out to prior to the debate instruct official to ask her icb to consider her concern again hear that she have have reply that be not particularly helpful again hope that her icb be watch this debate and listen to her case and to as the minister say from the dispatch box that we take these issue seriously good access to pharmacy service be important to her constituent and to the constituent of members right across the house we need to make sure that the network be protect and enhance on funding nhs england have commission an economic analysis of the cost of provide pharmaceutical service that work be happen right now with the pharmacy sector and we look forward to see the outcome previous government dither and delay on find sustainable and long term solution the consultation around this year funding and contractual arrangement with community pharmacy england do not make it over the line before the election be call so we as ministers be look at that as matter of urgency all that we be speak of today be against the backdrop of the most challenging circumstance since the second world war that be why the chancellor be carry out an urgent assessment of our spending inheritance and will be present the result to parliament before the summer recess so that the finding can inform every spending decision we make in the meantime be afraid that can not update the house on this year arrangement understand that that will be frustrating to the hon lady but the prime minister have ask and every minister of this government to be honest and open about the state of the nation finance intend to keep that promise but look forward to work with pharmacy stakeholder to discuss not just how we solve these problem but how we seize the opportunity for transformation in the sector and how we deliver health and social care in the community close to where people need it provide the new innovative treatment from pharmacy where that be appropriate this government will always put patient before politic in the spirit of the friendship that we have develop over the year particularly over the kinship issue look forward to work with the hon lady on this and other health relate issue and on make our country well fair and more equal place for her constituent and mine with well access to health service include community pharmacy hope to work with she in the year to come and let we hope that we can improve the pharmacy service for hampton and other part of england question put and agree to house adjourn
