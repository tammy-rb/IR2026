what assessment he have make of the impact of raise the high income child benefit charge threshold on household income these change be welcome and they mean that more lincoln family will receive more support from the government as tell the minister in lincoln on friday will my hon friend confirm when the formal consultation on base child benefit on household income rather than on individual income will commence if the civil servant in the treasury will let he do it rise to speak to new clause to and amendment draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests in relation to bpi let at the outset say what particular pleasure it be to listen to the maiden speech of my new hon friend the hon member for kingswood damien egan his description of his constituent comment to he during the by election will chime with all on the opposition side of the house it be clear that he will be an asset to the house and think it be fair to say that south london loss be undoubtedly kingswood gain we support accession to the cptpp because of its geopolitical benefit and the benefit to trade relatively limited thought they be set to be give that the conservative party have deliver recession cost of live crisis and the bad growth rate in the any uptick in trade and ultimately growth however limited would be welcome there remain however series of concern about the government approach to the cptpp and trade deal our amendment and new clause seek to address the weak arrangement for parliamentary scrutiny of trade deal the grow concern about the investor state dispute settlement and issue around performer right environmental animal welfare and food standard and the help that business will be offer to exploit the benefit however limited of this deal on new clause recognise the concern articulate by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith which be echo by the right hon member for north somerset sir liam fox and be sympathetic to the former call for an enhanced role for parliament be also sympathetic to new clause from the hon member for chesham and amersham sarah green under which parliament would require an assessment of the impact of any new country join the cptpp however think we need to go far than both those new clause do labour new clause would require ministers to publish such an impact assessment in parliament and to give the house vote on any new country join the cptpp give the security issue the impact on particular sector of the economy and on job in the uk as well as the opportunity that an accession could bring the british people surely have right to expect this house to consider the merit or lack of merit of any new accession to the cptpp during the lords debate the minister say that he think that new state join cptpp would trigger the crag process in the uk but the crag process as increase number of member across the house have largely come to agree be clearly not fit for purpose pacac be the late committee to make that clear in its recent report new clause provide the opportunity to reform part of that process let refer to what be say by the chair of the business and trade committee my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne and by the hon member for totnes anthony mangnall and my hon friend the member for walthamstow stella creasy we be promise by the secretary of state and by the minister in committee that there would be debate under the crag process as oppose to there be just this small implement bill we now know that the debate will not happen so that be another broken promise on trade the impact of new country join the cptpp will vary but could be considerable in certain situation it be only right that this country expect the house to consider those impact carefully hope that the right hon member for chingford and woodford green and the hon member for totnes and for chesham and amersham can be persuade to support our new clause it would achieve what they want in practice and go far with the leave of the house we will press our new clause to vote on new clause hesitate to damage the reputation of my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle and my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell who make excellent speech on the isds over the past year the marked acceleration in usage of the isds by large litigious corporation to challenge government climate relate or other environmental decision have prompt concern at the high level in the us in european capital and at the un so much so that government across the world be increasingly exclude or revoke the isds provision the problem with the isds be that it be secretive it avoid perfectly effective domestic public legal system it discriminate against small and medium sized business it often prevent the voice of those with genuine interest in the decision from be hear and it hold back environmental and other progressive public policy change strikingly the oecd could find no sustained evidence that the isds be key to secure and maintain business investment the nuffield trust briefing for today debate state that the isds could enable company to challenge some health regulation and nhs policy the us canada and the european union have all take step to revoke the isds provision in some of their major treaty the average amount this be just the published case that government have be force to pay from taxpayer money be about million for climate case it seem even more noteworthy that the un secretary general special rapporteur on environment and human right express concern just last september that the isds be significant threat to the net zero transition the paris agreement and tackle climate change some in government clearly share some of those concern as they want to exclude the isds from the bilateral trade deal with canada and support its abolition from trade with the european union the minister be somewhat evasive in committee initially he try to duck question on why the government want to exclude the isds from bilateral trade agreement with canada but be quite happy to leave it in the cptpp for canadian investor to use give that ministers have sign side letter with australia and new zealand to disapply the isds between our country in the cptpp it seem bizarre that they have not attempt similar approach with canada just after committee the government confirm that they be pull out of the energy charter treaty in which isds arrangement play major role say that it do not fit with net zero ambition the minister might want to try again to explain why it be essential that we remain committed to the isds element of the cptpp it be time for clear eyed assessment of the risk that the isds pose to our interest with the leave of the house the opposition will press new clause to vote there continue to be significant concern about the environmental impact of accession to the cptpp and the impact on food standard and on animal welfare the cptpp cover two of the deforestation front expect to account for of deforestation by range of environmental group be very concerned that when the uk join the cptpp preferential access to our market will be create as result of the removal of tariff on palm oil that could increase demand for product from threatened zone and exacerbate the risk of further deforestation minister still have not publish never mind present to this house deforestation due diligence legislation under section of the environment act so it be difficult to accept ministers claim that they be fully commit to our climate change target and to protect important source of global biodiversity on food standard deep concern remain that despite their protestation the deal that minister have negotiate include the cptpp will allow into the uk ever more food produce to low standard particularly animal welfare standard the whole house will remember the word of the former environment secretary the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice who tell the house that the minister and his colleague have give away far too much for far too report november vol when they negotiate the uk australia free trade agreement the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and the national farmers union in particular have raise concern that new tariff negotiate with mexico and canada will leave farmer in the uk much more vulnerable to import egg pork and chicken that be produce to standard that would be illegal in the uk the pesticide action network uk raise concern acknowledge by the trade and agriculture commission concern also raise by an hon friend behind that more food produce use pesticide ban in the uk will be import into the uk new clause would require ministers to publish plan to help business benefit from the new trade deal it be strike that the office for budget responsibility in its recent budget analysis make it clear that trade will make negligible contribution to growth through to under conservative party plan we remember that the secretary of state be appoint and within week export begin to fall then the minister of state be reappointe to the brief and export fall even far who could possibly have expect that to happen minister have cut funding for trade mission lead by business group themselves and cut funding for small and medium sized enterprise to get to trade show to open up new market for themselves the government website for help exporter be so poor that some firm use other country website to find where there might be opportunity minister could and should be do whole lot well to support our business to take advantage of any benefit in trade deal new clause would require ministers once the accession process be over to publish clear implementation plan to help business benefit from cptpp preference utilisation rate for other trade deal certainly do not offer any ground for complacency give that export under the conservative party have perform bad than every other member of the bar japan over the last decade it be strike that the chancellor have nothing to offer exporter and strikingly no mention of any plan to help british business exploit our come membership of cptpp in his recent budget for those reason be sympathetic to new clause table by the hon member for gordon richard thomson on amendment as the minister know and as the hon member for chesham and amersham set out there remain serious doubt from industry about whether the change the bill allow for in relation to the uk copyright framework be actually require we have have different explanation for the change from ministers at one point they be due to the cptpp on another occasion they be be make to comply with other international treaty obligation sign decade ago what be clear be that the change could have significant impact on the ability of the music industry to support new british artist because of those concern ministers be force to bring forward consultation on the change the consultation will not finish until after the bill have complete its passage through both houses in the bad case scenario estimate by the intellectual property office the change could cost over million it be likely that royal assent will have be grant before we know the outcome of the consultation process minister be force to bring this issue forward which have to say be just the late example of at good half hearted approach to the scrutiny of trade issue by those on the treasury bench
