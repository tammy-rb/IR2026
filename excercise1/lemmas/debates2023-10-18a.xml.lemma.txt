down crime across wales that include an extra police officer for welsh force under the police uplift programme approximately million have be allocate to welsh force through the safe street fund target neighbourhood crime violence against woman and girl and antisocial behaviour antisocial behaviour have devastating impact on community across wales and in cardiff north my constituent sarah suffer miscarriage due to the stress of repeat antisocial behaviour she be not entitle to any support because this government consider those who suffer from antisocial behaviour to be second class victim my amendment to change that in the victims and prisoners bill be reject by this government how can they claim to prevent crime while fail to support victim assure the hon lady that victim of antisocial behaviour be as much victim of crime as anyone else absolutely stand with victim of antisocial behaviour it be matter that we take very seriously indeed have not see the amendment table by the hon lady but she must be aware that this government have bring in long prison sentence for the most serious crime and make it easy for the police to arrest people carry out crime matter that the labour party have vote against call the chair of the welsh affairs committee the chief constable of dyfed powys police recently tell the welsh affairs committee that dyfed powys police force now have more

pass out ceremony recently and commend the work that it do call the shadow secretary of state for wales it be not just antisocial behaviour that be wreak havoc across wales shoplift in wales be also soar and in the year to march it be up by why will the secretary of state government not adopt labour plan to scrap the minimum worth of steal good rule which be introduce by his government in and allow gang of shoplifter to escape punishment and put shop worker at risk agree with the hon lady that shoplifting be serious offence and repeat shoplifter and those who go out in organise gang must be deal with by the full force of the law that be why welcome the fact that this government have bring in long prison sentence for people carry out the most serious offence do not understand why the hon lady will not join the government in support long prison sentence perhaps she should talk to her colleague in the welsh government who seem to be against build any extra prison place the secretary of state know that the prison estate across wales be not just full but that overcrowding be significantly above safe limit with his government have to commandeer police cell with judge be tell to jail few people and with criminal include those convict of assault be release early on the instruction of his justice secretary how can the welsh public have any faith that they will be protect the prison population have increase as direct result of policy that the government have implement to ensure that those commit the most serious offence spend more time in prison that be something that the hon lady should be supportive of she need to talk to her colleague in the welsh government who have state clearly in write that they be completely against build any prison place this government be build emergency prison place and fill up prison because people who commit serious offence deserve to go to prison the labour party in the welsh government be say clearly that it be totally oppose to build any extra prison anywhere economic link wales and the north west what step the government be take to improve economic link between wales and the north west this government be commit to strengthen the economy of north wales and north west england we have recently announce that we will invest billion in network north include billion to electrify the north wales main line that will improve connectivity across the region bring many part of north wales within one hour of manchester and liverpool by rail the announcement of the electrification of the north wales main line will help to improve transport link between this region and the north west of england support economic growth tourism and job across both area do my hon friend agree that resident across wales and my constituent in blackpool will see real improvement in their local transport infrastructure as part of their share of this billion that be available completely agree with my hon friend north wales often feel overlook by the welsh government indeed the welsh government have say that the electrification of the north wales line be not their priority just as it be conservative governments who build key element of the in the and we now see conservative government invest far in the infrastructure and prospect of north wales and north west england connectivity be key to underpin that economic growth and the railway line between north wales through my constituency in st helens and on to manchester should epitomise that but unfortunately it do not seem to be work at the minute it be frequently overcrowded and there be cancellation at the manchester end and at the chester end will the minister speak to his colleague in the department for transport as well as transport for wales so that we might make some progress and make sure that my constituent can get to work and this line can deliver economic growth for the north west and north wales of course improve rail be not simply about the rail infrastructure it be also about the train operating company and how they operate the hon gentleman be right that transport for wales have struggle from time to time can reassure he that do have discussion with it in fact be also meet the rail minister my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman later today when will reiterate those concern welcome the shadow minister to her new position thank you mr speaker strong economic link be dependent on the government actually have an economic plan but the conservatives track record speak for itself they cancel the electrification of the main line to swansea they be spend half billion pound but still potentially make up to steelworker redundant and their pitiful semiconductor strategy do not even give we bit part on the world stage why should anyone believe that their late promise make for north wales at desperate party conference be worth the fag packet they be write on welcome the hon member to her position she share welsh lesson with and hope she will continue to do so urge she to be somewhat more positive about the billion that have be announce for infrastructure development in north wales by mean of the electrification also in term of the steel industry at port talbot the half billion pound have save many job and mean that decarbonisation can occur be go to benefit wales it go to benefit people in north wales who will benefit from well access at crewe to london that be the secretary of state central argument for withhold billion of pound from wales by claim that benefit we now that the link at crewe be another casualty of tory chaos will wales office ministers stay true to their own logic and urge the treasury to class as english only as the right hon lady know rail infrastructure be not devolve would argue that investment in great britain rail infrastructure be of value to those in north wales and the rest of wales furthermore be an important connection to the west midland from london passenger from london to north wales be likely to still use that we all know that the money that have be commit be illustrative in major boost to plaid cymru campaign the national infrastructure commission for wales have propose devolve the crown estate and reinveste profit in community through sovereign wealth fund the commission criticise the current system of wealth transfer from the poor country in britain to westminster as illogical and bizarre whose side be the minister on welsh community or system that extract our natural wealth we have have this discussion on previous occasion in various setting but would argue that the crown estate allow this country to share risk and opportunity that it deal with it do fantastic job and simply do not agree cross border healthcare welsh government policy what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of welsh government policy on health authority on cross border healthcare what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of welsh government policy on health authority on cross border healthcare of course work within the nhs in north east wales and west cheshire and see the stark reality of the disparity in healthcare service between the two it be concern that the welsh government have miss their target to eliminate two year wait in most specialty and that more than patient have be wait over two year for treatment in wales compare with circa in the whole of england the health secretary have offer to consider request from the welsh government to use alternate provider in england to reduce waiting list and the distress that they bring with the welsh labour government face cut to their nhs as decision of their own do the minister not find it extraordinary that they be look at spend million on new politician and million on blanket mph speed limit that nobody vote for in wales entirely agree with my right hon friend it be scandalous that the labour welsh government be prioritise spending on more politician in cardiff bay as well as an unpopular mph default speed limit their decision mean less funding for the nhs education and other important devolved service they have the potential instead to invest in important capital project such as the royal alexandra hospital in rhyl they must re examine their agenda it get bad the uk government have twice offer the welsh labour government help in reduce patient waiting list for important medical procedure but neither offer have be take up will my hon friend the minister confirm that in fact that offer still stand and that patient in wales who be stuck and suffer on waiting list have not be forget by the uk government have speak with the department of health and social care can confirm that the offer still stand my hon friend will find it of interest to know that the labour welsh government do write in response to the late offer several week after that offer be make unfortunately the minister do not confirm whether they would accept the offer in the interest of ten of thousand of patient strongly encourage they to do so cost of live what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in wales what assessment he have make of the impact of increase in the cost of live on people in wales have regular discussion with cabinet colleague on range of issue include the cost of living the government have make certain that the state pension benefit and the minimum wage have all rise in line with inflation last winter the government energy support scheme see they pay about half the average fuel bill for homeowner across the united kingdom the bridgend food bank and the baobab bach food pantry be run out of food my constituent in ogmore and those across the bridgend borough literally can not afford to pay for the weekly shop what work be the secretary of state do to tackle the significant access to food crisis that be impact constituent in the bridgend county borough and right across wales as have already mention the government have make sure that pension benefit and the minimum wage have rise in line with inflation there have be other payment as well with to household on benefit to pensioner and to those in household where there have be disability the government have make certain at all time to prioritise the least well off may respectfully suggest that the hon gentleman should listen to the early question and suggest that the welsh government stop spend money on extra politician and put that back into community where it be need polling of people by public health wales find that about eight in welsh citizen be either worried or very worried about the rise cost of living with almost half say that it will have negative impact on their mental health similar concern have be express in scotland what consideration have the secretary of state and his cabinet colleague give to the snp call for energy rebate as winter approach as say in addition to the government priority on support the least well off and the fact that the government pay around half of people energy bill during the last winter we will continue to prioritise those who be have difficulty if the hon lady be really worried about cost of live crisis and the impact on energy she will do well to revisit her party policy of get rid of the oil and gas industry in the uk include in scotland something that would cost job and have terrible impact on energy price for homeowner across the united kingdom the wrexham flintshire investment zone bid could bring huge benefit to my region include more and well pay job an investment zone require collaboration between the welsh and uk governments there be possibility that the uk government could support two zone in wales but the welsh government have yet to give commitment to second zone if they do will the uk government also commit can assure my hon friend that have make very strong case to cabinet colleague for two investment zone in wales she be right that we need the co operation of the welsh labour government suggest that she and any member who represent north wales write to the welsh labour government economic development minister and suggest that welsh government prioritise two investment zone for wales we would be delighted to work with they when they get around to do that strength of the union what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the union what recent assessment he have make of the strength of the union our united kingdom be strong than ever it be testament to the strength of the union that the uk government have be able to support people across the country include with billion to respond to cost of living challenge at the welsh affairs committee this morning the first minister mark drakeford blame the uk government for not give adequate financial support to the welsh government in time of high inflation and cost of living crisis can the secretary of state tell we how much his department be spend on promote the uk government in wales why do he think that be well use of taxpayer money than fund service for the people of wales be happy to receive an answer by email if he do not have that information to hand first can assure the hon lady that the welsh labour government be receive record break settlement of more than billion and more per head to spend on public service than be spend in england perhaps the first minister should explain why we have long nhs waiting list in wales and why education standard be low as far as spending on public affair and promotion be concern can assure the hon lady that far great amount be spend by the welsh labour government than be ever spend by the wales office frankly the proof of the strength of the union be demonstrate by the fact that my hon friend the member for east kilbride strathaven and lesmahagow dr cameron have join the conservative and unionist party and she be very welcome have raise the damaging effect of the uk brexit on the port of holyhead and the north wales economy in this chamber time holyhead have be disadvantage by the lack of green lane for export to northern ireland in august at last his majesty revenue and customs confirm to that there will now be green lane for good travel from wales to northern ireland through holyhead and the republic emphasise as precaution that this be not freeport issue the secretary of state be very keen on that rather what specifically be he do to promote and enable those new procedure for holyhead do not quite hear all that but on the port in ynys môn be sure that the hon gentleman will take some comfort from the fact that the united kingdom economy have grow more quickly outside the european union than that of many nation that have remain in it the government have show their absolute commitment to both north wales and ynys môn through their development of freeport project for the area and the announcement of billion for electrification of the north wales railway line which will help to bring job and investment into north wales barry be wales large town but it have be ignore by the welsh government for decade it have significant regeneration challenge like many place congratulate my right hon friend on award barry town regeneration status but can he reassure that that do not preclude barry from benefit from level up funding obviously welcome the announcement but my right hon friend be far too modest since he have be knock on the door of the wales office and the department for levelling up housing and communities for very long time to demand extra funding for barry he make very strong case for that and assure he that the uk government will continue to listen to he cross border transport link between wales and england be key part of the strength of the union do my right hon friend agree that cross border project such as the pant and llanymynech bypass and the long term ambition to dual the pass through clwyd south and north shropshire be vital the united kingdom government be absolutely determined to support infrastructure project in wales we have do so through the levelling up fund it will happen again through the share prosperity fund and it have of course be happen through the growth deal what we do need be welsh labour government that will support infrastructure that be why find it so disappointing that the welsh labour government have rule out build any new road ever again it worry greatly that that be see as blueprint for the rest of the united kingdom energy cost what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on energy cost for household and business in wales the secretary of state and have regular discussion with cabinet colleague on range of issue include energy cost the government spend nearly billion protect household and business from high energy bill over last winter mean that between october and june typical household see half of their energy bill pay for by the government the government do not listen to the renewable energy sector which repeatedly warn they that the budget set for this year offshore wind auction be too low to attract bidder to develop offshore wind in the celtic sea can the minister tell the house why that advice be ignore lead to not single bid be make what can tell the hon lady be that it be an issue of discussion that the secretary of state and be engage with we understand the importance of float offshore wind in the celtic sea and it will progress in due course speed limits what discussion he have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the restricted roads mph speed limit wales order on the welsh economy what discussion he have have with the welsh government on the potential impact of the restricted roads mph speed limit wales order on the welsh economy no sensible person would oppose mph speed limit where there be case to be make on the basis of safety outside hospital old people home or school but the blanket decision by the welsh government which have be oppose by over signatory to the large petition in the senedd history be deeply unpopular deeply expensive and completely wrong give that more than people in wales have sign an online petition against the labour welsh government blanket mph roll out do my right hon friend agree that devolve administration across the united kingdom should listen to the people and the community they serve rather than their own narrow centralised agenda agree completely with what my hon friend say the welsh labour government need to listen to what people have say about this and they need to listen also to all those who be oppose to this ridiculous war on motorist which be not just about mph speed limit but block on any new road be build and extra road charge mr can just say to conservative members that the hon member be in the middle of ask question it be disrespectful to your own side you should think about what you be do people should wait just because you want to cheer somebody come in do it at the right time that be totally inappropriate thank you mr speaker labour like to showcase welsh labour as its blueprint for the rest of the united kingdom do the secretary of state not agree that this be yet more evidence of its war against motorist wherever they be wales dudley north or the rest of the united kingdom completely agree with my hon friend we need to be very careful of this blueprint for britain which include ban on new road ban on meal deal tourism tax road charge over million be spend on more politician minimum wage be pay to some asylum seeker and ban on news channel in the assembly that senedd members disagree with that be not blueprint for britain it be recipe for disaster hope the people of wales will take note and vote conservative in the next election mortgage interest rate increase what discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on the impact of increase in mortgage interest rate on homeowner in wales the government recognise that this be concern time for mortgage holder especially those who be due to come to the end of fix deal in the immediate future we be support borrower who be struggle with their mortgage payment through the new mortgage charter it set out the standard that signatory lender will adopt include new flexibility to help customer manage their mortgage payment over short period throughout scotland people be pay the price of the westminster make cost of live crisis as result of this conservative government and the action of the tories in crash the economy last year will the government bring forward that mortgage interest relief scheme for my constituent and perhaps even for those in east kilbride strathaven and lesmahagow the government have of course provide support for mortgage interest loan for those receive income relate benefit and the pre action protocol help to make repossession less likely that be in addition to the action that have already outline prime minister the prime minister be ask engagements if he will list his official engagement for wednesday october

sicken and this government will do whatever it take to keep our jewish community safe we have provide an additional million to support the community security trust we be work with the police to ensure

every day they hope for good news but fear the bad they know that the life of their love one be in the hand of murderer it be unimaginable agony israel have right duty to defend itself from hamas keep its people safe and bring the hostage home but be it not clear that if hamas have single concern for human life single concern for the safety of the palestinian people they would never have take these hostage and that they should release they immediately it be important for we consistently to remember that israel have suffer shockingly brutal terrorist attack and it be hamas and hamas alone who be responsible for this conflict our thought be rightly with those who have be take hostage and their family the distress they be feel will be unimaginable for all those affect will be meet some of the family and offer they all the support of the british government to get their relative home we be work around the clock with our partner and ally to secure their freedom and importantly in among my

harrowing humanitarian crisis child flee their home hospital barely able to function the light be go out and the innocent civilian of gaza be terrified that they will die in the darkness out of sight international law must always be follow hamas be not the palestinian people and the palestinian people be not hamas do the prime minister agree that medicine food fuel and water must get into gaza immediately this be an urgent situation and innocent palestinians need to know that the world be not just simply watch but act to prevent humanitarian catastrophe as say on monday an acute humanitarian crisis be unfold to which we must respond it be right that we support the palestinian people because they be victim of hamas too that be why we have provide furth million in humanitarian aid for people in the region and we be work on pre emptively move aid and relief team to egypt specifically to the el arish airfield we be work with local partner like the egyptian red crescent and the united nations primarily and deploy navy asset to the region as well as explore how we can support logistical requirement have also raise the issue of humanitarian access as priority in all my conversation with every leader in the region we will continue to work with they to get aid to where it be need as quickly as possible as have be allude to since hamas terrorist attack our country have see disgusting rise in antisemitism jewish business attack jewish school mark with red paint and jewish family hide who they be and we have see an appalling surge in islamophobia racist graffiti mosque force to ramp up security and british muslims and palestinians speak to as if they be terrorist do the prime minister agree with that every member of this house have duty to work in their constituency and across the country to say no to this hate and to ensure that every british jew and every british muslim know they can live their life free from fear and free from discrimination here in their own country all of we in this house can play our part in stamp out those who seek to cause division and hate in our society we will make sure that we continue fund the community security trust and the equivalent protective security grant that protect mosque and other place of worship for the islamic community in the uk that funding be increase early this year we will also remain in dialogue with the police to make sure they be aware of the full tool at their disposal to arrest those who perpetrate hate crime and who incite racial or other religious violence there be no place for that in our society and know this house will stand united in make sure those who do this face the full force of the law we do not want this conflict to harm we here at home and we do not want it to escalate in the middle east where there have be too much bloodshed too much darkness for too long two state solution palestinian state alongside safe and secure israel feel more distant than ever but it remain the only way through do the prime minister agree that because hope be at its thin we must work our hard to ensure that the voice of division and despair be sideline and that however difficult it seem the hope of political path to peace be maintain it be precisely because it be that vision of more hopeful peaceful future that hamas have try to destroy that we must redouble our effort to try to bring that future about in all the conversation that the foreign secretary and have have with regional leader we have emphasise our commitment to make sure that we make progress on all the avenue that will lead towards that peaceful future that have be feature of our dialogue and be confident there be willingness in the region not to escalate this crisis beyond deal with hamas the terrorist organisation and to strive very hard towards future where palestinians and israelis can co exist peacefully side by side and look forward to future fill with dignity security and prosperity this be crisis where life hang in the balance and where the enemy of peace and democracy would like nothing more than for we to become divided and to abandon our value do the prime minister agree that during this grave crisis the house must strive to speak with one voice in condemnation of terror in support of israel right to self defence and for the dignity of all human life which can not be protect without humanitarian access to those suffering in gaza and the constant maintenance of the rule of international law agree we will in this house speak with one voice in condemn hamas for perpetrate shockingly brutal terrorist attack and cause untold suffering for many as the right hon and learn gentleman say we stand united in support israel right to defend itself to protect its people and to act against terrorism unlike hamas the israeli president have make it very clear that israel armed force will operate in accordance with international law we will continue to urge the israelis to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian while remember importantly that it be hamas who be cruelly embed themselves in civilian population may associate myself with the word of the prime minister and commend he and the foreign secretary for the work they be do to find peaceful settlement in the middle east may also welcome the prime minister decision to provide billion worth of funding for east west high speed rail line between manchester and liverpool and his focus on great northern town as well as city in the north will he ensure that town such as warrington benefit fully from this rail upgrade and that hub station at warrington bank quay link northern powerhouse rail to the west coast main line remain key part of the network north thank my hon friend for his continued campaign to improve rail service in warrington he be right we will be invest billion to well connect manchester and liverpool that would allow for the delivery of northern powerhouse rail exactly as previously plan include high speed line which would provide well rail connection for the people live in northern town such as warrington know that he will be discuss this far when he meet the rail minister call the scottish national party leader we all continue to unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist attack on the jewish people and the israeli state we fully support the defeat of hamas and of course the safe return of all hostage who have be take so too hope do we all share the same common humanity of protect civilian and condemn any act of collective punishment against the palestinian people in that regard many of the image emanate from gaza in recent day will shock we all to the core so may ask the prime minister will he join those of we on these benches and call for an immediate ceasefire in the region we believe that israel do have right to defend itself to protect its people and to act against terrorism and ensure that the awful attack we have see from hamas can not happen again unlike hamas the israelis include the president have make it clear that their armed force will operate in accordance with international law we will continue to urge the israelis to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian my ask for ceasefire be do with all sincerity not only in order to protect civilian but to ensure that we have the safe creation of humanitarian corridor which will allow not only for food water and vital medicine to get into gaza but for innocent civilian catch up in this terrible conflict to flee in respect of those who wish to flee may ask the prime minister what early consideration if any his government have give to the creation of refugee resettlement scheme akin to those previously put in place for syrian national afghani national and of course ukrainian national be proud that we be already one of the most significant contributor to the united nations effort to support palestinian refugee our funding support about million refugee annually and on monday we announce significant increase in our funding of aid to the region include to the un to support refugee with regard to humanitarian aid as say before we be already work through pre emptively move aid and relief team into the region but critically the most important thing be to open up access for that aid to get into gaza which be why our conversation with the egyptians and other be so critical we continue to work closely with ally to find every way to get that aid to the people who need it as quickly as possible last night section of the british medium be report as fact that it be israeli rocket that have land and attack the al ahli hospital rely on information supply by official in terrorist control gaza the headline have since be rewrite but the outpouring of jew hate on social medium overnight be vile so will the prime minister please make the point again that the way that this conflict be be report have massive implication for our jewish community and that any information come from hamas must be treat with degree of scrutiny and cross examination that is sadly sometimes lack commend my right hon friend for his excellent intervention he be absolutely right that we should not rush to judgment before we have all the fact on the appalling situation that we see yesterday particularly give the sensitivity that he raise and the impact on community here but also across the region as say it be incumbent on all of those in position of responsibility in this house and outside in the medium to recognise that the word we say will have an impact and we should be careful with they we be work with our ally to establish the truth of what have happen we will do that robustly and independently but my right hon friend be right to point out that in the same way as we do not treat what come out of the kremlin as the gospel truth we should not do that with hamas associate my party with the comment make in relation to the deplorable loss of innocent human life in both israel and gaza have leave the european union building link and co operation across the four nation of our united kingdom can only strengthen the union will the prime minister agree with my proposal for the creation of an east west council to bring together all part of the uk family to discuss and collaborate on trade and the many other opportunity present by the union the right hon gentleman make powerful case in his conference speech last weekend for strong function northern ireland within our union my right hon friend the secretary of state for northern ireland have have the opportunity to discuss our share commitment to the union with the right hon gentleman party over recent week and month and be grateful for the constructive approach and tone take

this breast cancer awareness month encourage anyone who be invite to take up the offer of breast cancer screening of course the sadism of hamas can only be condemn and there be no question of israel right to defence and security but international law be very clear that act against international law in response to terrorism be unjustified so in all the package that the prime minister have announce vis vis humanitarian aid and the military package that he announce last week can he tell the house how the government will ensure that international law be adhere to beyond just statement from israel head of state the hon member talk about our military asset let be crystal clear the asset that we have move into the region be not there in any combat capacity they be there for two reason first and foremost to provide surveillance to ensure that this crisis do not escalate and that arm be not be send to entity like hezbollah that be what our surveillance aircraft be currently do and indeed the next set of asset arrive this week will also help but also to provide contingency support for humanitarian assistance as and when require in the come day and week on sunday terrence carney year old

demand it will the prime minister take action will he make sure that enforcement be deliver will he ensure that people who have no right to be here be expel enough be enough want these people out of

decide who come here and not criminal gang we have all be horrify by event in israel and gaza and it be right that we condemn utterly the inhuman terrorism of hamas that should also be the case for any obscenity and war crime carry out by the israeli defence force both the un and médecins sans frontières have describe the siege of gaza and the withholding of water from its people as collective punishment war crime under the geneva convention yet this week both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition have support israel right to do so why quite simply put israel suffer from brutal terrorist attack at the hand of hamas and it be absolutely right that israel have right to defend itself root out terrorism and ensure that such an act do not happen again as israel president have say its military will operate within international law but the hon gentleman fail to acknowledge that it be hamas who embe themselves inside civilian population and put innocent civilian in harm way he would do well to remember that my right hon friend have be absolutely right to lead the nation in reassure the british jewish community in the wake of the utterly appalling atrocity visit upon israel and jews on october understand that my right hon friend will be travel to the region and he will see for himself the shock and trauma that be through the israeli nation after this event shock and trauma that be accompany by rage the enormous danger be that the israeli reaction lead by prime minister who will be hold accountable for this failure of intelligence be go to amount be indeed amount to war crime that will not only be crime it will be mistake urge my right hon friend there be now no one well place to urge israel to stay within the international rule of law and to exercise restraint on behalf of we all as friend we will always urge israel to take every possible practical precaution to avoid harm civilian and indeed to act within international law as israel president have say its armed force will do while recognise the incredible complexity and difficulty of the situation on the ground it bear repeat that hamas be terrorist organisation that embed itself inside civilian population we always have to remember that israel be take every possible practical step to avoid harm civilian and we will do everything we can to provide humanitarian support to the area the prime minister will be delighted to know that nuclear veteran like my constituent grandad john be start to receive the medal he promise but john be still not get his full medical record his blood test from christmas island which be crucial to claim war pension be miss and countless veteran report the same as the ministry of defence have admit that it hold at least file withhold from national archive refer to blood test and other datum will he review those document report back to the house and hold public inquiry into why medical record omission have happen and on whose instruction start by thank all our veteran for their contribution to our safety and security be delighted to have be able to announce the new nuclear test medal last year and that it be start to be receive by many people include the hon lady constituent she will know that can not comment on ongoing litigation in respect of request for health record but can say that anyone can request copy of their own medical datum by submit subject access request to the department and if they be not satisfied with the processing of that request they can make formal complaint via the complaint process we appear to be on downward spiral in the middle east which inevitably will lead to humanitarian crisis the role of egypt will be fantastically important what can we in the wide international community do to work with the egyptians to ensure that refugee come on to egyptian soil be legitimate refugee who pose no threat to the egyptian state and be not terrorist in disguise my hon friend raise an excellent point regard the egyptians concern about that border but we have prioritise speak with president sisi and be in continue dialogue with our egyptian partner to see what we can do to provide reassurance and get humanitarian aid to the region we be work with local partner include the egyptian red crescent and the un on the ground there will be significant logistical challenge in stockpile aid at the border and then move it into gaza but assure my hon friend and the whole house that the development minister be actively engage in that work as we speak so that we can play lead role in facilitate the provision of that aid this be the final question before the urgent question call patricia gibson thank you mr speaker the industrial dispute at the defence equipment and support ministry of defence site at beith in my constituency be drag on as worker engage in strike action for parity and fairness in the workplace these worker be critical to ensure that necessary supply to ukraine be uninterrupted but all attempt by the worker to resolve this dispute have prove to be unsuccessful in the face of management intransigence will the prime minister personally and urgently use his influence to ensure that meaningful offer be make to these worker so that the matter can be resolve further strike action can be avert and supply to ukraine can continue without disruption thank the hon member for highlight the critical role play by non craft support operative at defence munitions different rate of pay for worker with different skill and qualification be entirely normal practice

injured the uk be work intensively with our ally to establish the fact we will not rush to judgment the whole house will understand that point finger prematurely only fuel regional instability and upset community cohesion here in the uk we need firm grasp of what have happen not slew of social medium commentary we all share duty to be thoughtful and careful in how we respond to report emerge from the conflict which can be at well incomplete or at bad example of active disinformation we be carefully analyse the evidence that have be put in the public domain and other information as soon as we have reach definitive conclusion for ourselves we will make it public some thing be not in doubt however as my right hon friend the prime minister set out hamas carry out terrorist assault on israel that be unprecedented in that country year history the whole house unite in support of israel right to defend itself against terrorism in defend itself israel must act with professionalism and an unwavering commitment to international law state must take every precaution to minimise civilian casualty and ensure that humanitarian support reach those in need welcome president herzog unequivocal commitment make both directly to and in public that israel be operate in accordance with the rule of international law by embed themselves in civilian population use innocent palestinians as human shield launch thousand of rocket since saturday from one of the most crowded place in the world and prevent civilian from heed israeli warning about future area of operation hamas reveal themselves and their callous indifference to human life in this tense situation uk diplomacy be relentlessly focus on our aim support our national in their moment of need push for and deliver humanitarian support and work to prevent tension spill over into the wide region or play out on the street of this country have travel to israel and engage with ally and regional partner and will visit the region again later today because we recognise that this will require intensive effort none of we know how this complex protract situation will develop the government be commit to keep the house update both here in the uk and in the region this be time for cool head and determination to make difference thank you so much mr speaker for grant this urgent question be grateful to the foreign secretary for his engagement with the opposition at this very difficult time today we stand united in mourn the death of hundred of innocent palestinian civilian at the al ahli hospital place of healing become scene of destruction hospital must always be protect the death of every civilian palestinian or israeli be an equal tragedy that push back the cause of peace when face an incident of this magnitude we all have duty to act responsibly and judiciously as the fact be determined will the foreign secretary join in urge everyone in this house and beyond to be wary of disinformation and to avoid dangerous speculation before the fact be clear will he also update the house on what he be do to deal with outside power that might be seek to drive division on our own shore the prime minister and the foreign secretary have rightly say that they be work to establish the fact look at intelligence with our ally and that must be right we also note president biden comment early today can the foreign secretary confirm whether the uk government share that initial assessment also ask he to share with we what information he can either publicly or on privy council term do he agree that those responsible for the death at the al ahli hospital must be hold to account since hamas appal terrorist attack on israel day ago labour have be crystal clear that first we support israel right to defend itself rescue hostage and protect its citizen secondly international law must be follow at all time and thirdly civilian must not be target aid must be provide and innocent life must be protect gaza be in the middle of an active humanitarian emergency innocent palestinian civilian be terrify for their life can the foreign secretary today commit that the government will leave no stone unturned in their diplomatic effort to secure humanitarian access to food water fuel electricity and medicine and to ensure the establishment of humanitarian corridor and the proper protection of humanitarian worker palestinian civilian in gaza must know that the world be not simply watch but act on their behalf the right hon gentleman make number of important point which commend to the house number of which will respond to and indeed amplify he be absolutely right that this be an incredibly sensitive situation and not just for the region itself our desire to prevent this tragedy from expand into regional conflict remain an absolute priority and of course we have duty as government be sure it be passion share by the whole house to ensure that jewish and muslim community in the uk be safe and feel safe and do not experience ramification from circumstance that be far beyond these shore and beyond their control for that reason everybody particularly those who have voice in the public sphere whether formal or informal should be particularly careful about what information they disseminate they should be particularly vigilant against disinformation and speculation be never useful appreciate that the house and indeed the country will want to understand what be go on in real time and sometimes the pause that we impose on ourselves to ensure that the information the government provide be accurate can be frustrating but would prefer of course to be accurate rather than just to work at pace the right hon gentleman be right that there be malign influence seek to take advantage of this terrible situation and we do guard against that we take note of what president biden have say but we will come to our own judgment we will work on that quickly and ensure that our assessment be put in the public domain as soon as we be confident of the detail call the father of the house as the foreign secretary say we should soon know the direct cause of this explosion will send he and the prime minister letter that have receive from the worthe islamic society think that jewish people and other in my constituency will agree with every sentence it end by ask the government to use their influence and support to encourage peaceful and sustainable resolution that prioritise the right and well being of innocent civilian catch up in the onslaught the father of the house make an incredibly important point as former minister for the middle east be acutely conscious of the implication for islamic community both in the region and here in the uk and the protection of those people be as close to our heart as the protection of jewish people here in the uk we will relentlessly pursue what be the endure uk government position which be viable two state solution with israelis and palestinians live in peace side by side of course these circumstance be setback but nevertheless we will not be fatalistic we will continue to work with israel the palestinian people and the wide region to bring about that positive aim call the snp spokesperson it appear that what happen last night at the al ahli hospital in gaza be war crime it be crime against humanity and if that be the case there can be no hiding place for those who give the order and those who carry it out independent investigator must be allow to find out exactly who be responsible for this atrocity and have they bring before the international criminal court the scene of death and destruction from last night be beyond harrowing but the tragic reality of this conflict be that innocent civilian life be be view as little more than collateral damage they be not collateral damage every single human life matter and they matter equally israeli include the hostage who must be immediately release and palestinian today it be report that as direct result of the draconian collective punishment against the civilian population of gaza child be die of thirst will the government now finally tell the israeli government that the imposition of collective punishment be crime that it be breach of international humanitarian law and that it must end immediately note what the hon member have say about the incident at the al ahli hospital as say we will be make statement only when we be comfortable about the fact we have to be realistic that the opportunity for any kind of independent investigation go into gaza be severely limited which be why we be take the time to ensure that we get this right in all our conversation with the israelis we have reinforce the need for the protection of civilian they understand that and they agree president herzog have make commitment about adherence to international law we must however be completely clear that hamas accept no such limitation on their action they have specifically target civilian and child they go out of their way to identify and murder the most vulnerable and it be completely appropriate for israel to take action to protect its civilian and prevent hamas from perpetrate further atrocity in that country call the chair of the foreign affairs committee the situation be unbearable but while the horror of last night can not be unseen we must not look away violence be increase across the region but also in europe and the us we in this house have duty to protect british national so what assessment have the government make of whether the joint terrorism analysis centre need to raise the threat level can also have reassurance about what be be do to protect out diplomatic staff around the world after the heinous attack we see on israeli and american embassy overnight my hon friend make an incredibly important point we constantly assess the threat picture both here in the uk and in the region have conduct an all staff meeting with foreign commonwealth and development office staff across the whole world be tell that over people attend that briefing make it clear that as their employer regard my duty of care towards they as uppermost we do of course continue to support british national overseas include in the region and our consular team be maintain as well they can contact with british national in israel and indeed in gaza it be an incredibly difficult consular situation but can assure the house that we will remain as far as we be able to in contact with those british national seek our support and we be consistently try to reopen exit route from gaza so that british national can leave the foreign secretary will be aware of the horror with which the missile strike on hospital in gaza which cause hundred upon hundred of casualty be regard not just here in britain but in the region and internationally the house have hear his injunction not to jump to conclusion but would he support genuinely independent inquiry into what be happen of course an independent inquiry be the gold standard in the event of such circumstance but the simple truth in relation to have any kind of independent investigation in gaza be that the current situation bear in mind that our own embassy team there be severely limited in what they be able to do and the international community be not able to operate freely make the practicality of that incredibly difficult we be make our own assessment we will gather and analyse as much information as we can we will not be lead by any other nation it will be uk assessment of the situation once we have come to conclusion we will share it with the house and the country be sure that my right hon friend and the government be wise not to rush to conclusion and to have proper investigation before they come to conclusion about what actually happen in this utterly appalling incident be strike by the number of email have receive from constituent who have already rush to conclusion and all blame israel do he agree that this show the important responsibility not only that broadcaster have to ensure they do not disseminate false information but that owner of social medium platform have to try to avoid hate be spread literally around the world at time like this my right hon friend will know that within government action be be take to ensure that social medium owner act with great professionalism and great consciousness of the impact they have would make broad point to broadcaster have have this conversation directly with they in the past which be that believe there be an attempt by broadcaster to try to outpace social medium platform the day of break news on traditional platform be long in the past they should focus on accuracy rather than pace because their word have impact here in the uk and around the world my heart break for everyone who lose their life in the episcopal hospital disaster last night it be now quite clear that even hospital be not safe place of refuge anywhere in gaza that hospital be strike by missile the week before yesterday want to understand quite clearly from the foreign secretary why as we call on the country for humanitarian access to gaza we be not also call for an immediate ceasefire to enable that to happen it seem to bizarre that we can not call for ceasefire to enable that humanitarian corridor to open because the scale of death that be now unfold will reach tenfold over the next few day in line with that would really like to hear from the foreign secretary assurance that he be speak to our israeli counterpart to ensure that any gazans and palestinians who do evacuate will have an absolute right of return to their land and do not end up languish as the million of other palestinian refugee currently still do in both jordan and lebanon have conversation regularly with the israeli government and with the government of country in the neighbourhood about palestinian refugee be unable to go into the detail because they be extensive but the hon member should be aware that we have always support palestinian refugee with the million to the united nations relief and works agency and the recent announcement of an additional million be direct response to the situation there the simple truth be that israel do have right to defend itself the truth be that hamas have no interest in ceasefire they have no interest in resolution they have never attempt to engage in two state solution and they have make every attempt to collapse the oslo process they be no friend of the palestinian people they have fire literally thousand of rocket into israel since saturday israel do have the right to take action to defend itself and to recover its hostage and the uk while respect that will of course always encourage it to adhere to international law and to protect civilian the foreign secretary be surely right to say that we must not rush to judgment on this incident but do he agree that one fact we know right now be that the primary moral and as result legal responsibility for the appalling civilian life loss in gaza today and in the day ahead lie with hamas first for their attack on israel and secondly for the systematic practice of use civilian as human shield know that my predecessor and right hon friend be very well read on this situation and pay tribute to the work he do when he be foreign secretary and be his minister for the middle east and north africa he be absolutely right and we must be clear eyed about the trigger event it be the most brutal mass murder in terrorist action in the history of the state of israel and the large loss of jewish life on single day since the holocaust of course israel have the right to defend itself and we must never forget that hamas action of embed themselves in civilian community and put palestinian life intentionally at risk to pursue their political aim be completely unjustifiable whatever the outcome of the independent inquiry into what happen with the tragedy in gaza yesterday in reality gaza be such densely populate area that no matter what effort be make the effect of bombing will be indiscriminate if the government can not go as far as call for ceasefire will they at least call for the end of the rocket and the bomb if they can not go as far as to call for the end of the bombing can they at least call on israel to stop bomb the south where refugee from gaza city be go at the instruction of the israeli army cease in the bombing could trigger the negotiation that enable the release of the hostage pay tribute to the work of the international community in try to secure the release of the hostage my right hon friend the prime minister emphasise the work that the qataris be do in this instance they be not the only one do that and we will continue to support their effort hear what the right hon gentleman say about call to stop the air attack on gaza from israel but the simple truth be that the alternative be ground assault by israel and as he say the practicality of any military operation in an area as densely populate as gaza will be deeply challenging again remind the house that the people who murder those reveller those partygoer those child and those old people embe themselves in civilian community in hospital in school specifically to use innocent palestinians as human shield we must all understand the culpability that they hold for many of these civilian casualty but will of course once again speak with the israelis about make every effort that they be able to make to minimise civilian casualty whoever be responsible for the hospital attack last evening it be an appalling human tragedy and we think of all those who have lose their loved one at this time welcome the foreign secretary commitment to be evidence lead in what the government say about this incident do he agree that if the uk intelligence community whether that be gchq the secret intelligence service defence intelligence and so on be have to take time and deliberate in order to come to conclusion perhaps all of we in this place include medium organisation outside this place should also show the same caution and consideration before make statement that could prove incendiary my right hon friend make an incredibly important point there be of course the completely understandable desire of medium outlet to report promptly but believe they have great duty to report accurately and responsibly word that emanate from the uk be take seriously we have huge standing in the world and thing that be say at the dispatch box in this house and on our medium be listen to around the world therefore we have an enhance duty to ensure that the word we say be accurate deplore the loss of all civilian life israeli and palestinian and commend the foreign secretary for his caution over attribute blame for last night attack do he think that we should also be cautious about the figure for casualty come from gaza they do not describe all as civilian casualty there be reason to believe that there be very high volume of hamas combatant among those figure the hon gentleman make an important point be not go to minimise the pain and suffering of those palestinian family who have lose love one and have people injure but we know that just as hamas be abuse the palestinian people they also abuse the figure that they put in the public domain we must be highly sceptical of any information come out of hamas just as the prime minister say we should be we remain focused on try to reduce the pain and suffering of the palestinian people as well as support israel and its self defence while do so we should be deeply deeply sceptical of any and all information come from hamas spokesperson commend my right hon friend for his caution we should remind ourselves of the word of mark twain lie can travel half way around the world before the truth have get its boot on never more certainly be that the case than here remind hon member that hamas bear complete responsibility for everything our heart go out to all the innocent who have die and suffer of course they do but hamas be the perpetrator and they have bring this on themselves we remind ourselves that when they murder all those israeli jews in the territory they film they and commit atrocity deliberately that be to remind the israelis of the holocaust and what be likely to come do the foreign secretary agree that broadcaster should not enter into discursive debate when as issue such as this happen they should report the fact as know and nothing far my right hon friend speak with authority and clarity on this and find myself in complete agreement with he have jewish friend who be try to keep their child off social medium because they know that they will be assault with image of israelis who have be murder and whose body have be desecrate no one in the modern era should have to endure that kind of repeat pain evacuation order in the past week have include hospital but many vulnerable people be unable to move because of their disability or illness what conversation have the foreign secretary have directly with uk aid agency and non governmental organisation about that situation what more can the uk do to ensure that civilian population include medical and aid worker be protect the hon lady raise an incredibly important point and my department remain in close co ordination with international aid agency and ngos we recognise the practical difficulty of that evacuation order and in highly dense area such as gaza we completely understand those practical difficulty particularly for medical organisation as imperfect as it may be attempt to remove civilian from future area of military operation stand in sharp contrast with the action of hamas who be actively seek to prevent people from leave an area of future conflict and intentionally put civilian in the way use innocent palestinians as human shield commend the foreign secretary and his opposition shadow for their tone but the fact be that last night an evil terrorist organisation that murder jews and oppress palestinians be instantly believe in number of quarter whereas many refuse to acknowledge that jewish baby have be brutally murder without demand graphic proof do the foreign secretary agree that unsubstantiated report such as those we see last night might actually cost life because they inflame tension in an already highly volatile region my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right everything have cost and rush inaccurate reporting cost life everybody whether they be formally involve in the reporting process citizen journalist or just active on social medium should be very conscious that this involve real life in the most sensitive of circumstance and that such reporting could have repercussion not just in the area or the region but in this country as well we rightly unite to condemn the barbaric action of hamas against innocent israelis and the loss of palestinian life and the unfold humanitarian crisis be profound tragedy the scene at al ahli hospital shock we all and hope the secretary of state will do everything to ensure an independent investigation but people in gaza be trap so what more will he do to ensure consular support not just on the ground there but to family heartbroken back here in the uk will he hear and heed the word of nadia el nakla the wife of our scottish first minister whose family be trap there right now she say we be not watch natural disaster this can be stop the consular department in the fcdo have get in contact with the family of those british national who be trap in gaza and we be provide ongoing consular support the hon lady will understand that the experience of the first minister his wife and their family be live example of the plight of number of family information be incomplete our access be severely limited and sadly we have to rely on number of interlocutor and people over whom we do not have direct control include hamas we will continue to support british national as good we can until they have be evacuate from that area one fact that be not in dispute be that every rocket fire from gaza into israel be aim at murder civilian in stark contrast to israeli defensive action last night there be member in this place include senior member scurry around state as fact that this incident be cause by an israeli rocket the bbc and other medium refer to statement by hamas think they mean to say hamas terrorist and present they as fact without challenge that not only risk radicalisation of community in this country where we already know there be problem with antisemitism but put jews at risk urge colleague to be careful of their comment give the role that blood libel play in promote antisemitism my hon friend make an incredibly important point and restate my request of all people comment on this whether they have formal role within the medium or be in high profile position such as member of this house to be thoughtful of the implication of their action to be sceptical of all information come out from hamas and to take little extra time to verify which can literally save life here and abroad know this situation be complex and the taking of life and hostage whether israeli or palestinian be abhorrent but we have to recognise that palestinians can not defend themselves they have no mean and now their place of sanctuary such as hospital be no long safe place either for that reason urge the foreign secretary once more to call for ceasefire so that we can see de escalation in this horrific conflict of course everybody will rephrase that all reasonable people want this terrible situation to be resolve and resolve quickly this be not conflict that israel ask for it be conflict that they be force to engage in because of the mass murder in their country perpetrate by hamas terrorist who embe themselves in school hospital and in civilian community call for ceasefire be all well and good but have see nothing nothing that lead to believe that hamas would respect call for ceasefire may say to my right hon friend that whatever the investigation find out in sense it will not matter great deal to all those who be dead in the hospital whether the israeli explanation be correct that it be an islamic jihad missile that misfire and then land among explosive that be on the hospital site that then kill so many people or whether it be an israeli strike in the end both side have now commit war crime if they be just additional crime be add to the ledger on either side that be simply what it will be say to my right hon friend in his relation with israel and in reinforce the position of the prime minister that the only way to get out of this mess be ceasefire otherwise we will not see the relief of people who be starve and be dehydrate to death that be collective punishment which be illegal under international law follow the deportation of people from northern gaza which again be illegal under international law there be specific offence that have already take place and say to my right hon friend for all our sake he should work as he say with clear minded determination to get the good answer from our ally the house need to understand that prior to hamas terrorist attack ten of thousand of gazans pass through the border into israel every day in order to work israel provide often without payment water electricity and gas to the people of gaza that be interrupt as direct result of hamas brutal terrorist action thousand of rocket be fire from gaza into israel from in and among school hospital and civilian community we do of course always remind israel as we would any other nation involve in military operation of their duty under international law president herzog israel head of state have reinforce that commitment we hear no such commitment from hamas last night absolute tragedy of the explosion at the al ahli hospital will simply intensify passion and polarise the debate even more many child and young people here in the uk will have see the image on our television and screen and on social medium platform and think they will be influence by that while thank the government for the money and support they be give to the organisation protect faith school mosque and synagogue can the minister tell we what he be do to provide advice and support to ordinary school and our university where there be an intensification of hatred emerge and where be hear of both antisemitic and islamophobic view be express and attack be work on individual the right hon lady make an incredibly important point while will not go into detail of conversation in cabinet can assure she that the protection of all community in the uk be something that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities highlight that very much go hand in hand with the commitment that the home secretary have make that we will protect all community in the uk muslim jewish and other and we will work with institution whether educational institution or other to try to ensure that the people at those institution can go about their life free from fear intimidation and discrimination very much agree with the foreign secretary that the entity responsible for the loss of life we be see now be hamas terrorist barbaric organisation that kill innocent jewish people the question now be about do everything we can to save life of both israeli and palestinian people who be innocent in that regard welcome the government commitment to humanitarian assistance for the ordinary people of palestine and the foreign secretary differentiation like the prime minister differentiation between the people of palestine and the terrorist organisation hamas the foreign secretary say that move forward we will work towards two state solution the people in the region want to know what that two state solution be be that base on security council resolution and the border which the united kingdom sign up to what be clear framework for that the chairman of the foreign affairs committee my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns have previously ask for the uk to appoint an envoy to the region we have two brilliant contender if may say so in william hague the foreign former secretary who get the region and alistair burt brilliant well respect former minister we have choice and option when will the foreign secretary outline that part of the next step my hon friend make some important point the truth be that we remain committed to two state solution with palestinians and israelis live side by side in peace and prosperity while at the moment and in these circumstance that might feel like an unachievable aim we refuse to be fatalistic and give up that aspiration the detail will be for negotiation but he and the house will have hear we say on number of occasion that it will be base on the border with land swap and share capital in jerusalem but we will not be dogmatic what we want to see be peace bring about hear what he say about appoint special envoy we have some of our most capable people in our post in tel aviv and jerusalem and in gaza repeat my condemnation of the hamas attack against innocent israeli citizen we see civilian in gaza forcibly move from their home with no guarantee of safety or return yet the government fail to speak out we see food water and electricity cut off in gaza yet the government fail to speak out last night we see the destruction of hospital in gaza the government now need to speak out will the foreign secretary support the international criminal court investigation into the situation in palestine give that the prosecutor have say that its mandate include the current context that so obviously and urgently must include investigation of the hospital explosion we need to ensure that no more blood be spill we need ceasefire now must say to the hon lady that her assessment of the uk government voice on this issue be fundamentally wrong we have consistently discuss with israel and publicly our commitment to humanitarian law she need to understand that military force highlight future potential area of conflict and encourage people to move away from that area of conflict be not force relocation interruption it be not force relocation draw her attention to the action that hamas have take to prevent innocent palestinians from move away from place of danger the contrast could not be more stark give that we do not know the fact about what happen and whether for example this be ghastly mistake we should be here not to blame but to mourn the loss of so many doctor staff and patient at the al ahli arab hospital which and several other hon member from the house visit more than decade ago it be found in the late century by the episcopal church in jerusalem and be run by it to this day so it be likely that christians as well as muslims will have lose their life will my right hon friend whose approach have be appropriately calm at time when we need to reduce and not inflame tension both domestically and in the middle east do his good to stay in touch with the anglican church to see if it have more information about what have happen to those who be there to see how we can help re establish what be valuable programme for example it provide free breast cancer treatment and mobile clinic and do all he can to think about how in the long term we can enable people in that troubled land to co exist in way that we have for so long fail to do support the united nations relief and works agency as far as possible on its humanitarian mission my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the tragic loss of life in this instance as have say the uk government share in the grief of those who have lose love one irrespective of their faith or their community we know that there be incredibly passionate voice on both side but as have say number of time we have duty to be calm and careful when we speak about this issue we will continue to work for peaceful co existence of all the community in that region as difficult as that is it will remain priority for the uk government rise order it be my intention to call all member who be here at the beginning of the urgent question and who be try to catch my eye have to say to the house that we be clearly deal with very sensitive emotive and sad subject but it be not necessary for every member to express their grief understanding and empathy that have be do let we take it for grant that we be all break hearted about the situation let we not repeat that before every question this be not an occasion for speech it be one for question if we can have straightforward short question that enable the secretary of state to give straightforward short answer we will get everyone in if not there will be disappointment be terrified that there will be an escalation lead to many more civilian on all side be murder have listen intently to what the foreign secretary have say about why he be not call for ceasefire but could he explain both as diplomat and as military man how we can get humanitarian aid in how we can create safe zone and how we can prevent civilian loss of life slightly long term will he tell we what conversation he be have with the international community about long term aid and support for the inevitable palestinian refugee the hon lady the chair of the international development committee make an incredibly important point the prime minister my ministerial colleague and of course our ambassadorial team in the region have be speak extensively to try to facilitate humanitarian access that have be most notably with egypt but we have also be use our very good relationship with the qataris to try to influence hamas and of course our direct relationship with israel to try to broker some kind of humanitarian access even if only temporarily thus far that have be unsuccessful we will continue to work on that we have allocate an additional million for direct humanitarian support for the palestinian people of course we be not limit to just that and we co ordinating with the international community to ensure that whether in gaza or wide in the region palestinians be look after in these difficult time my constituent david longe be priest in north norfolk and formerly serve as priest in jerusalem speak to he on the telephone last night and he have potentially lose friend who be work in the al ahli hospital he tell that there be gazans shelter in church so will the foreign secretary please make it absolutely clear in his discussion that the humanitarian role that the church be currently partake in must not be underestimate and that the roman catholic church in north gaza and the greek orthodox church must be absolutely protect for the people they be shelter my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the importance of the faith community we often talk about the jewish faith and islam but when it come to this region the christian church play an incredibly important role and pay tribute to they have hear his point and will continue to speak about the avoidance of civilian casualty particularly in place of safe haven such as church when seek to counter an insurgency in afghanistan over decade ago general mcchrystal adopt new concept for nato soldier courageous restraint this be to separate the insurgent from the civilian among whom they live can the foreign secretary inform the house how courageous restraint can be urge on all combatant include through the full resumption of the water supply to gaza courageous restraint which the hon gentleman highlight be now well embed concept in professional military force have discuss with representative of the idf my admiration for its professionalism and my expectation that it will maintain that professionalism through any military operation courageous restraint be not concept in the heart of hamas terrorist we must be realistic about that therefore we will work with israel and other country in the region to try to bring this to conclusion as quickly as possible but we maintain our support of israel self defence and we highlight the fact that hamas be just as willing to see palestinians kill as they be to see israelis kill to pursue their political aim last night much of the uk medium feel it appropriate to immediately and with no room for doubt blame israel before the idf give its evidence that the rocket be launch from palestinian islamic jihad it be right that the uk government independently assess what happen all that be make so much hard because hamas have no moral no boundary and no problem with kill any innocent civilian in israel or gaza will the foreign secretary reassure that he know that stand with israel now will put we on the right side of history my hon friend be right to highlight the callous nature of hamas activity and those of other terrorist group embed in gaza we express our solidarity with the israelis in their time of grief in the aftermath of those terrible attack and we stand in solidarity with they still we be good friend with the state of israel good friend speak honestly with each other and we will always do that but we will always stand beside nation that seek to protect itself and its people in the face of such relentless terrorist threat last night explosion at the al ahli hospital only add to the unspeakable pain of innocent palestinian civilian in gaza as the foreign secretary know they face deepening humanitarian crisis unable to access food water fuel electricity or medical supply when do he expect supply of those lifesave necessity to be restore to gaza we have speak to israel and country in the region about the humanitarian need which be why we put forward the additional money that the prime minister announce on monday of course we do not want those innocent palestinians catch in gaza who be suffer because of the action of hamas to suffer any more than be absolutely necessary we will continue work with the international community on humanitarian support and with israel on the preservation of civilian life keep hear the word of my mother in my brain and have do for the last week twa wrang dinnae make right hamas be an indefensible organisation in any right person book but the fact that they will not do right do not mean that the uk government should not demand and work hard towards ceasefire and make sure that humanitarian aid get into gaza think repeatedly as do many other of helpless child be mother and grandmother and that be what think about every night will the foreign secretary please make every effort not just to have money set aside but to tell we how he will get humanitarian aid into gaza city and help those who be suffer in israel as well call for ceasefire be understandable and have much sympathy for the position the hon lady set out but ceasefire have to be respect by both party in conflict and have see absolutely nothing in the behaviour of hamas during and since the terrorist attack that give any confidence at all that they would respect ceasefire unless they respect ceasefire it be not credible to demand that israel do not defend itself against terrorism to follow up on the previous point the un secretary general antónio guterres have also call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire clearly the foreign secretary have some issue with that though do not really understand why be it not appropriate for third party with people on the ground such as the un to make an assessment one that with respect be probably more realistic than his in the meantime what safe corridor be be propose have the foreign secretary consider they so we can at least have some safe evacuation for gazans remind the hon lady and the house that we have people on the ground my staff be in danger in gaza they choose to put their life at risk in an incredibly dangerous part of the world in order to give direct insight into the reality on the ground urge she to be bit more thoughtful with regard to the danger that my uk base diplomat and locally engage staff put themselves in the truth be that have receive nothing that give any indication that hamas or the other terrorist group operate in gaza would respect ceasefire respect the un secretary general call for ceasefire we would all love to see the bloodshed cease but we have to be realistic about the fact that hamas like the other terrorist organisation in gaza have demonstrate over and again complete callousness towards human life whether israeli or palestinian after all the decade of suffering injustice and occupation endure by the palestinian people this terrorism and the scene of death and destruction at al ahli arab hospital be truly heart wrench those responsible must be hold to account international law must be adhere to and there should be no collective punishment of the palestinian people will the secretary of state advise the house how he feel peace can be obtain and of his effort to urgently deliver food water medicine and other aid to blockade gaza the hon gentleman and the house will have hear the detailed explanation that give in answer to the initial question of the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy we work relentlessly with the country neighbour israel and gaza will travel to egypt once again to try to facilitate humanitarian support and we will work with those country that be able to influence the leadership in gaza we will not rest we will continue to do everything we can to alleviate this terrible humanitarian situation the hon gentleman ask what be the good thing to do for peace good starting point would be terrorist not fire rocket from densely populate area into israel thank the secretary of state for his clear commitment and true word that believe have capture the collective opinion of we all in this house as he say last weekend hamas terrorist kill israelis injure and kidnap almost the news last night and this morning fill we all with despair the bombing of the ill and the elderly at al ahli arab hospital be reprehensible to the extreme and to be condemn however the circumstance of that horrific event be not clear do the secretary of state agree that while horror and sympathy be to be express judgment must be withhold until all fact be know and clear the hon gentleman as always speak with great thoughtfulness on this issue the immediate and understandable expression of sympathy and condolence be absolutely right and proper but that should not be conflate with rush to judgment do so have significant effect and as have say can quite credibly cause further pain suffering and loss of life we should all be conscious of that when we speak in the public domain thank the secretary of state for the work he be do to bring home my constituent who be trap in gaza note his comment about the consular support for uk national would be grateful for any further information he can provide if he can on facilitate the safe passage of uk national and the flow of humanitarian aid urge he to pursue these matter on his trip to the region later today assure the hon lady and the house that those be exactly the issue will be raise on my forthcoming travel to the region the consular team in the fcdo be make regular contact with those people in gaza for whom we have contact detail to give they as much notice as possible as and when an exit route become available at the moment that have not become available but we will keep work to open humanitarian route and to inform people once they be open we do not yet know who be responsible for the unspeakable atrocity at the gaza hospital but we do know that hundred be kill and hundred more be injure we do know that yesterday an idf airstrike hit an unrwa united nations relief and works agency school where thousand be shelter kill more and we do know that over civilian have be kill in gaza so far israel do have the right to self defence but that can not include mass bombing of densely populate area if israel be simultaneously to stay within international law urge the secretary of state to think again about the issue of ceasefire of course it would need to be work for and of course it be go to be hard but unless the uk government give their backing to the un on this issue thousand more will be kill we should be on the right side of history and be very much afraid right now that we will not be israel be one of the party engage in this military operation but there be other include hamas and palestinian islamic jihad suggest that anybody call on israel to cease military operation should at least at least call on the terrorist to do likewise as hospital be target medical relief organisation be desperately try to evacuate sick and wound patient to increasingly few place of safety while protect the dedicated staff look after they will the foreign secretary confirm how many function hospital be leave in gaza and how palestinians who continue to be target by bombardment be suppose to receive lifesave medical treatment the simple truth of the matter be that do not know the status of the medical facility in gaza we want they to be protect we have make that clear and we will continue to do so in all future engagement and conversation we have with israel we will of course call on hamas and the other terrorist organisation to remove themselves from the proximity of those hospital if they be conduct military operation the un report that the last water treatment desalination plant in gaza have shut down at the same time people be drink contaminate tap water and polluted sea water the world health organisation say that people need litre of water day and people in gaza be survive on three can the foreign secretary tell what practical step be be take to ensure the resumption of fuel supply to water treatment work in gaza the situation with regard to the provision of electricity gas and water from israel to gaza be of course important we have speak with israel about this the hon gentleman make the point that gaza do have its own water production capability we see video post by hamas proudly demonstrate how water pipe fund by european aid be be rip up and turn into rocket to fire into israel although of course we speak with israel about support to the palestinians in gaza and our own support to the palestinians in gaza we must not overlook the fact that hamas have habitually persecute punish and oppress the palestinian people in gaza we have already see one iranian terror proxy hamas launch attack against israel in the past day but we know that another iranian proxy hezbollah be wait in the wing to attack israel from the north indeed this may have already start what step be the government take to deter hezbollah from seek to attack or otherwise undermine israel at this most difficult time the hon lady make an incredibly important point the united states of america and the united kingdom have put naval asset in the eastern mediterranean as my right hon friend the prime minister say at prime minister question that be not to conduct military operation it be to conduct surveillance operation to prevent iran or indeed anyone else from supply hezbollah with lethal aid that might be use against israel in recognise israel right to self defence against hamas brutal terrorism the government have rightly cite international humanitarian law however it seem to be the position of the government that it have so far not yet be break indeed today the foreign secretary have several time cite president herzog to that effect by contrast we have number of un agency and actor non governmental organisation and international lawyer all say that collective punishment be clear breach of international humanitarian law include for example the cutting off of supply and the forced movement of people frankly force people to leave their home or hospital because they be under threat of bombing be force movement how do the foreign secretary address those contradiction in the uk government position there be no contradiction in the uk government position have set out the government position the hon gentleman may disagree with it and other may disagree with it but there be no contradiction the terror attack on israeli citizen and the subsequent abduction be brutal and evil the scene from al ahli hospital last night on the television be beyond comprehension and upsetting and it go without say that we have to do everything we can to stop the impending humanitarian crisis in gaza from happen but be really concerned be sure the foreign secretary be that the conflict between israel and hamas do not spill over into the street of any community in the united kingdom my home city manchester be welcome of muslim and jew alike what more be the government do to ensure that the catastrophe in the middle east do not end up on the street of britain the hon gentleman make an incredibly important point can give he and the house our commitment to protect all community in the united kingdom no one should be hold responsible for action happen thousand of mile away they have an absolute right to live in peace and security here in the uk the prime minister the home secretary and the rest of the government be absolutely committed to do everything we can to protect all people of whatever faith or community here in the uk fourteen hundred year on from cáin adomnáin the law of the innocent to protect woman and child in conflict both the terror of hamas and the utterly disproportionate and illegal response by israel stain our modern world rather than the supine acceptance of israeli us policy will the secretary of state instead hee the wise counsel of president higgins of ireland and seek both an immediate ceasefire and justice for the palestinian people uk foreign policy be set in london not in washington and not in dublin the foreign secretary have talk about accountability and accuracy in broadcast and social medium do he share my bafflement at why the bbc our national broadcaster have repeatedly refuse to describe hamas as terrorist organisation when they be proscribe terrorist group be genuinely baffle by this understand that the bbc say that to do so would be to take side but fundamentally disagree with that the bbc have use the word terrorist on number of occasion both domestically and internationally and just do not understand why it can not bring itself to describe hamas as terrorist because that be what they be it be imperative that we get to the bottom of the terrible tragedy that unfold at the hospital last night and hold to account whoever be responsible when visit the region last year see and hear just how difficult it be to supply medical care to the palestinians hospital across gaza now face run out of food fuel and water and several have be give evacuation order which accord to the world health organisation patient will not survive may urge the foreign secretary once again to join the united nations in call for the immediate resumption of essential supply to gaza in line with international humanitarian law which he say he keep call for the hon lady have repeat question that have be ask in the house number of time and she will have hear the answer that have give on each of those occasion the grief and loss of million in gaza and in israel have only be add to by the horrific and heinous attack on al ahli hospital be pleased that both the foreign secretary and the shadow foreign secretary reiterate our commitment to international law and the importance of bring those who commit war crime to justice while also not rush to judgment we have our own staff and international humanitarian agency on the ground in hospital in gaza what be the foreign secretary do to ensure that those hospital can carry on treat innocent civilian work with the united nations the international committee of the red cross and the hospital themselves we do of course speak with israel and as have say we call on the israelis to employ the professionalism of which they be understandably proud to minimise civilian casualty and to ensure that where possible civilian infrastructure particularly school hospital and religious site be not damage however it be not by accident that hamas habitually embe their terrorist operation in those very place make the life of palestinians inevitably far more dangerous than they would be otherwise commend the uk government for the announcement of an extra million of aid for gaza but that will be of no use to the civilian who be trap and injure there if it just pile up at the border what analysis have the foreign secretary official conduct of the legality of the israeli authority order to restrict supply of water food fuel and electricity to gaza and the legality of their order to million palestinian civilian in northern gaza to evacuate and travel south those be question of legality foreign secretary the hon and learn lady will know that legal advice within the department be for ministers to inform our decision making the broad point be that we do of course want to end the suffering that palestinians be experience and the good way of do that be to remove the yoke of hamas from their shoulder which be why we support within the framework of international law israel right to self defence hundred of my constituent have write to express horror at the attack that have happen in israel and now at the unfold catastrophe in gaza one of they have family member in gaza al ahli be one of hospital in northern gaza in view of the hundred kill last night the child write their name on the palm of their hand and the mother give birth in the street as their home be destroy and their hospital damage can the foreign secretary update the house on the action be take with international partner now to ensure that hospital and medical staff be be protect give that he say early today that he be not sure of the situation relate to hospital it be estimate that there be mother in gaza include pregnant mother will the foreign secretary update we on whether there be plan for their healthcare and on whether he be confident that that be be deal with and urgently need medical and humanitarian supply be get through as say early in fast evolve situation during conflict such as this it be extremely difficult to conduct an up to date assessment of the ability of medical facility in gaza to maintain operation we do of course want civilian and civilian infrastructure to be protect wherever possible and we have communicate that to israel but let say again that protect they be make infinitely more difficult in these circumstance because hamas and other terrorist organisation specifically embe themselves in civilian infrastructure that be long stand habit of such organisation welcome the foreign secretary recognition of the need to exercise caution before leap to conclusion give the difficulty of verify information in situation of crisis but will he commit himself to personally make contact with different social medium and technology company urge they directly to help prevent the spread of disinformation and prevent any information war relate to this horrific situation will not commit myself to do that personally but know that the secretary of state for digital culture media and sport take this issue extremely seriously we be of course take action to try to improve professionalism on social medium platform and while personally will not be make that contact directly know that it be be do and will continue to be do by the government at this tragic time be drive by my desire for peace and the protection of innocent while this tragic war continue will the foreign secretary do everything he can to ensure that international law be follow that of course include the protection of hospital medical professional civilian and humanitarian aid for gaza however this war will only end through dialogue so will the foreign secretary also do everything he can to keep the flame of hope for negotiate peace settlement alive will he make that priority for his government even when at time it seem such very distant hope the hon lady be entirely right about the need for we not to lose our desire to bring genuine sustainable peace as have say in these particularly difficult time that may seem very far off and indeed impossible aspiration but we will remain relentlessly focused on bring last sustainable peace to the israeli and the palestinian people and indeed to the wide region can give the hon lady the assurance that while deal with the immediate challenge we will also keep that long term aspiration at the forefront of our mind will the british government support brazil motion call for humanitarian ceasefire on which the un security council will vote later today if not what be the ground for not support it give that the brazilian text include criticism of hamas whereas the russian text debate on monday do not if hamas refuse to honour the ceasefire as the foreign secretary fear will they not be see by the eye of the world as not protect the people whom they purport to represent have speak to the brazilian foreign minister about the text of the security council resolution and we be liaise closely with the brazilians and other but will not be able to give commitment on our voting decision until the text be close and the negotiation have be conclude when visit israel and palestine three week ago with group of mps we meet aid worker and health worker who say their last goodbyes to their family every morning because they do not know whether they will return there be an urgent need to support they and the uk public be be very generous in response to appeal in the absence of humanitarian corridor and support he in argue for they can the foreign secretary update the house on effort to work with uk base agency that be on the ground in gaza to support the provision of mobile health clinic medicine food and water there the distribution plan for the initial million that the prime minister announce on monday be still be work on but can assure the hon lady that we be have very close relationship with non governmental organisation and aid organisation base in the uk and operate in gaza and the region we will of course be liaise with they both in term of get an update understanding of the situation on the ground and of maximise our support to the palestinian people the most urgent priority must be to prevent the loss of any more civilian life to do so the un general secretary have call for an immediate ceasefire lead humanitarian agency such as oxfam have also call for that surely the government must add their voice to that do the foreign secretary accept that if they do not many thousand more will die will he also withdraw his early remark that what be go on be not force relocation if he do not believe that he will come to regret that remark of course all of we want to see an end to the life that have be lose but we also recognise that israel feel the need to take action to protect the life of its citizen from the attack emanate from hamas and other terrorist organisation in gaza we have always say that in our support for that activity we call upon it to abide by humanitarian law as its president have commit to do we need swift confirmation of who be responsible for the devastating attack on the al ahli arab hospital but the immediate priority be humanitarian support for those affect the million pledge by the uk government be genuinely welcome but can the foreign secretary explain how that aid be go to get to those affect when israel have close all humanitarian corridor the situation at the moment be that all humanitarian support go into gaza be severely limited there be an open fluid border between israel and gaza and ten of thousand of palestinians from gaza ten of thousand of gazans work in israel daily and move to and fro between gaza and israel that crossing have to be close as do the rafah crossing into egypt in response to the terrorist attack that be perpetrate against israel we be work with the israeli government the egyptian government and the international community to try to open up humanitarian corridor and we will continue to do so the level of conflict information and indeed disinformation come from gaza and the irresponsible reporting of this as fact include that come from the bbc yesterday be surely something that we should be condemn what be the foreign secretary and his department do to correct this approach from broadcaster will he join in say the blame should not be cast until all the fact be know especially to avoid inflame tension both here and in the middle east this apply to we all and particularly to broadcaster that have high level of international standing be big fan of the bbc and know the huge influence that the voice of the bbc have internationally because of that influence it be incredibly important that the bbc and other broadcaster be very careful in the reporting of this issue because of the sensitivity and because of the implication not just in the region itself but here in the uk that be general plea to all broadcaster represent significant number of jewish and muslim constituent many of whom have link to israel and palestine my constituent be devastate and deeply concerned about the innocent civilian catch up in this horror and worry about the implication close to home the sight that we have see overnight be horrify will not ask the foreign secretary for fact that he do not yet have but we see this human tragedy unfold far overnight so be ask for clear assurance on deliverable humanitarian aid now it be reasonable that we ask he to look as hard as possible at ceasefire which would of course apply to all party because the innocent civilian in the region have to be our immediate priority can he also comment on the need for urgent international work towards peaceful long term solution for the region the israeli and palestinian people deserve bit more of refocus on their long term peace the hon lady speak with great passion which know be genuine when be first appoint to the then foreign and commonwealth office in february be the minister for the middle east and north africa and can assure she that have be personally focus on try to find resolution to this long stand and painful issue the entire time have be minister in the foreign service can assure she that the government remain focused on that long term peaceful resolution to this terrible situation can also assure she that we want to see the money that we have allocate actually turn into humanitarian support for the palestinian people that of course mean have humanitarian access but that be not happen at the moment we will continue to use all our diplomatic effort to try to unlock those humanitarian access route resident in walthamstow be mourn the loss of all civilian life in this conflict it be very personal to they rania and sharone be two walthamstow resident sharone be here at the moment meet the prime minister about her parent who have be kidnap by hamas rania and seven member of her family be stick in gaza try desperately to get out want to put on record our thank to the foreign secretary and his officer for what they have do so far but sharone desperately need help to get more information from whatever party or third party agency about her parent and the medical welfare and rania be desperate to get her family back home to we in walthamstow but there be misinformation on the ground as well have the foreign secretary also consider whether the kerem shalom border could be look at as one way to get humanitarian aid into gaza to help those affect by this crisis and to bring our people home want to commend the work of our consular team that be deal with family who be suffer loss who be grieve and who be deeply fearful for the welfare of their family and love one overseas know that the hon lady and other hon and right hon member will have constituent who be deeply fearful about what be go on would urge they all to use the consular contact

try to maintain contact with those british national who be currently stick in gaza can give the hon lady and the house an absolute assurance that we will not rest and we will not step back from our duty to support british national overseas have have many hundred of email over the past few day from constituent who be deeply distressed at the ongoing loss of human life in the middle east have be move by the story from many of the medical professional on the ground in gaza who have not only run out of medical supply include painkiller but have no water with which to carry out their job when can they expect to receive those essential item the hon lady ask pertinent and important question at this stage be not able to give she any credible assurance on the timescale around this obviously we be work with the international community and the country in the region to try to get humanitarian access we have set aside the money as the prime minister say at prime minister question early today and we have forward load some of our expert to ensure that any opportunity to provide humanitarian support can be utilise at very short notice but the truth be that be not able to give her assurance on timescale the house be grateful to the foreign secretary and his colleague for be here for an hour and half there be great many question to be ask and be glad that today everybody who wish to ask

they those who have support network but who be not rich enough be force to crowdfund and to fly thousand of mile to access treatment the rest sadly have to accept their fate there be no hope they just have to wait if they be lucky they get to nine month in march when make my first speech about glioblastoma feel the same way that have always feel be fill with hopelessness appal that the disease have be ignore for so long and leave at the bottom of the too difficult pile for year the government have not touch the side of the million they allocate for research into glioblastoma after five year they have spend just million quarter of the amount promise university have ignore glioblastoma for year too glioblastoma be not even on the research agenda many university be focus their resource on trial on mouse neglect the real people who be cry out for new research and clinical trial it be pretty grim landscape but it have not be like this for people diagnose with many other cancer people with breast bowel and lung cancer have have the hope of research clinical trial and funding promise be keep the government university and pharmaceutical company have come together to make concerted effort to change thing and they do just look at what we have do for people with lung cancer in only one in people diagnose with lung cancer survive for five year by life expectancy have double in of people diagnose with breast cancer survive for five year by get to live for five year in of people diagnose with bowel cancer survive for five year in we manage to bring that figure up to however for people diagnose with glioblastoma there have be no progress and no hope that thing will get well in the five year survival rate for people diagnose with glioblastoma be ten year later in the survival rate be almost identical just although the treatment and life expectancy of people diagnose with glioblastoma have not change in year feel more hopeful today because since make this speech in march have meet the minister for health and secondary care the hon member for colchester will quince and the shadow secretary of state for health my hon friend the member for ilford north wes streeting have also meet clinician charity family and university and last week meet representative of the top pharmaceutical company in the uk to discuss why we be where we be have build up clear picture of where we be know that if we try something different we can give people diagnose with this deadly disease some hope so here be something different first we need target of get glioblastoma patient each year into clinical trial on drug that have the potential to change the course of the disease that would be patient over the lifetime of parliament with those trial we could begin to understand what work and what do not secondly the nhs should take every drug that have already be license to deal with other tumour and apply they to clinical trial on glioblastoma brain tumour that have not yet happen because glioblastoma be very small target market for the pharmaceutical industry and such investment be not very profitable the government must either encourage or force the pharmaceutical company to provide the drug for these trial apply those exist drug would be cheap way to make huge difference it be sometimes the only way that make difference university should act as partner in these trial they should be snap up the opportunity to carry out research in this area instead of leave the field untouched thirdly the nhs should ensure that every neuro oncology multidisciplinary team have medical oncologist who be core member and be require to attend meeting to discuss patient so that brain tumour patient be not leave in corner of the ward because there be no specialist argue for they unless neuro oncologist be in the room we will not benefit from their idea or expertise fourthly the nhs should require that every doctor train to be medical oncologist should go through mandatory course on brain tumour at the moment the royal college of physicians require no compulsory training doctor have to take two course on bowel cancer as part of their training but not single course on brain tumour the reason why there be nobody on those ward or in the research infrastructure be because nobody be require to do the training who can apply for the research fund if there be nobody in the field if we do those four thing we have chance of some hope have not just whisk up this four point plan it be the result of meet expert in the field include none other than dr paul mulholland europe lead brain tumour oncologist if we carry out those four step expert think we can drastically improve treatment for everyone diagnose with glioblastoma some have even say that we could find cure for glioblastoma within year einstein famously say the definition of insanity be do the same thing over and over again and expect different result that be what we have be do for the past year with the treatment of glioblastoma we can do well and margaret legacy demand nothing less the hon lady will know that the whole house send she our sincere sympathy for the loss of her sister and that we all recognise the courage it take for she to come to the house to speak about this very difficult subject when put the question be not go to call for the noes because know that nobody will say no question put and agree to order that siobhain mcdonagh tracey crouch greg smith steve brine mr alistair carmichael mrs sharon hodgson tony lloyd dame meg hillier mr clive betts jon cruddas paul blomfield and sarah owen present the bill siobhain mcdonagh accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday november and to be print bill energy bill lords programme no motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the follow provision shall apply to the energy bill lords for the purpose of supplement the order of may energy bill lords programme consideration of lords message proceeding on the lords message shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion two hour after their commencement subsequent stage any further message from the lords may be consider forthwith without any question be put the proceeding on any further message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their bowie question agree to energy bill lords consideration of lords message clause local supply for community energy beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment lords amendment be add to the bill during consideration in the lords of commons amendment as be set out the government do not agree with the inclusion of the amendment and after far careful consideration we remain of the same view today the amendment commit the government to consultation on the barrier prevent the development of community energy scheme and set out whom we would consult it also commit the government to bring forward proposal to remove identify barrier to community energy however as result of work closely with colleague who have make representation during the passage of the bill on september set out the government commitment to consult on the barrier that the sector face when develop project as part of that process we be involve the community energy sector in design the consultation through our community energy contact group the group have already have constructive discussion on this work at its meeting early this month the government have already make clear commitment to the consultation announce that commitment at the dispatch box in september we therefore think it be unnecessary and of no additional value to put the specific of it in primary legislation thank my hon friend for all the work he have do to put in place not just this consultation but the fund which will be tremendously useful for these purpose too do he accept that there be sense of urgency here that there be need to get on with remove these barrier if he be not content with the timetable set out in this amendment will he give the house an indication of what he think the right timetable be so that community energy company and other can know where they stand and get on with the good work that he and be both in favour of thank my right hon and learn friend for his intervention of course agree with he that pace be of the utmost importance in support community energy group around the country which be why the contact group have already meet early this month and be engage already on identify the barrier that the consultation will seek to address and thus inform the government as to what we need to do that work be ongoing which be why we do not feel that this amendment be require we have begin that process already there be other issue with the amendment that mean we can not support its inclusion in the bill the amendment would place an additional obligation on the government to bring forward proposal to remove these barrier within specific timeframe as just say we can not be sure what barrier will be raise in the consultation or what the proper response to those barrier should be until we have carry it out we therefore can not create legislative obligation to remove barrier within six month timeframe when we be not aware of the nature of the barrier and have not yet properly analyse they appreciate the minister argument but that be technically not what the amendment say there be no requirement for legislative reform only one to bring forward proposal it be unfair to mislead the house order it be not mislead the house the minister might possibly have do so inadvertently but he would not have be mislead the house my apology to the minister do not mean to make accusation so strongly the challenge here be that subsection of the new clause set out in the amendment contain no reference to legislation such as the minister suggest that be my point thank my right hon friend for his intervention it be the department view and mine that the amendment would result in legislation be require as say we absolutely understand the importance of this which be why launch the consultation process as do it be why we be engage so closely with the sector and all interested party so that we can get this consultation up and run and out as soon as possible and identify those barrier prevent community energy group from access the market know that he have passion in this area and hold strong conviction on it would be happy to continue to work with he alongside the community energy contact group as we develop our proposal for the consultation also wish to reassure the house that we will continue to work closely with the sector to support its important work both through our exist support include for example the million community energy fund and in carry out the consultation to which we have already commit call the opposition spokesman that be disappointing and specious defence by the minister of his intention not to proceed with these proposal from the other place he know perfectly well what the barrier to develop community energy be we have debate they at length during the passage of the bill so be not sure it be go to take forensic panel of inquiry to find out what those detail be before the government can act on any of these thing we be on the last lap of the energy bill and it be particularly disappointing that we be hear what we be hear today about this lords amendment the bill which have be with we in both houses for well over year now put into place many of the essential tool that will enable energy to progress towards low carbon net zero future the opposition have consistently support the bill while endeavour during its passage to strengthen it in its low carbon mission we have try to place into the bill further element to make it the good it can be in pursuit of its low carbon mission and there have be some juncture during its passage when the minister have endeavour to take on board those suggestion for strengthen it in some instance by draft government amendment that meet the purport of our amendment be grateful to the minister for those change to the bill and for the collegiate way in which the bill have be debate and decide upon however there be exception to that one of which be in front of we today as the minister state it relate to community and local energy which be sure member will agree be and will be an important part of the future low carbon energy landscape it have the potential to make serious contribution to our local carbon arsenal of plant while be fund and support by the community in which that plant be situate make it easy to develop and able to restore the benefit of its operation to the community itself labour have commit to provide strong support for community energy include the assistance of great british energy the company we propose to set up to support the development of local low carbon plant with community energy scheme the potential for such scheme to contribute to the overall installation of low carbon system in the uk be immense with perhaps gw of install capacity add to the national stock through such local scheme remind the house that that be get on towards the equivalent capacity of three nuclear power station such as hinkley point we know that at the moment there be substantial legislative and administrative obstacle to the development of community energy most notably the ability of community scheme to trade their output effectively during the passage of the bill we try to introduce clause to address those problem indeed when the bill first come to the house from another place their lordship have insert clause to the bill to that effect unfortunately the government delete they during the bill commons passage as be sure the house will appreciate their lordship quite rightly feel very strongly about the issue so they attempt to restore those passage to the bill when it return to the lords for ping pong however again just recently the government reject those proposal one of the barrier will be the shortage of grid and cable capacity to link into be the hon gentleman envisage some kind of privileged access or some solution to the grid shortage that be not quite the subject of our debate but the right hon member can see that we envisage an energetic and far reach proposal to develop the grid in such way that those grid shortage be overcome so that the grid be able to service the low carbon economy in the way we would all want it to do in the context of what we be discuss remind the right hon member that this would be about distribute grid at local level rather than the national high level grid we need to take further action to strengthen and sort out grid at that level the lords clearly continue to feel strongly about this issue as we can see they have send back to we today modify version of the original amendment require the government to consult on change to assist community energy and importantly to set timeline for proposal to be bring forward to remove barrier to the development of community energy of course there be other in this house who feel strongly about this issue the proposal that the lords have now twice try to have insert into the bill be essentially the wording of group call power for the people which suggest word for community energy enable bill for which it campaign to secure sign up support from parliamentarian it do indeed secure substantial support from parliamentarian who feel strongly on the issue of community energy some members sign up in support include conservative members and perhaps most remarkably member of the government include six treasury ministers the present chancellor and the minister himself as often seek to remind he there be no lack of support in the house for the principle and practice of community energy the lords amendment seek to acknowledge and far that support by put forward very reasonable and one might have think pretty non contentious wording to add to the bill it be inexplicable to that the government should seek to resist these proposal in the way they have yes they will say as the minister have say that they have set up community energy fund of million over two year which be welcome and they have verbally indicate that at some stage there will be consultation on barrier to supply but there be no timeline for that and no commitment to move positively forward from it that be what this amendment seek to put right as have say the minister appear already to be sign up supporter of community energy action and would fear for his own emotional wellbeing if he be force today to perform another policy backflip and acquiesce in yet another government repudiation of themselves in reject this late lords amendment instead let we end the extended passage of the bill on high note and all around the house agree on both the importance of community energy and the measure we will need to take to ensure it thrive in the future rise in support of the amendment it be very similar to an amendment that table during the previous stage of the bill in the commons echo the comment that have be make about the amendment be uncontentious it call for additional consultation if the government want to do that will do it myself for the community energy group the net zero review hold several roundtable with number of community energy group across the country indeed they be one of the reason why pillar in the final report mission zero independent review of net zero be net zero and the community one of the key finding of the review be that over half of all net zero decision will need to be take not by government or parliament but outside this chamber we can turbocharge our transition towards net zero if we can empower and support more community energy group to take the action that need to be take indeed the only single wind turbine that have be build in the united kingdom in the past year have be deliver through community energy be proud that it be in my home city of bristol ambition lawrence weston have see its mw turbine build and it will now power home for the community energy project the million to pay for the project be raise by the group it do not come cap in hand to government and now it will see an economic return of year as result of the energy that will be sell to the grid that be just one example of the myriad example of net zero project that demonstrate the economic opportunity that net zero can provide in bristol we also have the bristol city leap which be result of million investment from bristol city council there have be million of inward investment from the american company ameresco ltd to decarbonise the city district heat network community energy point the way for demonstrate that net zero be not cost despite what some may say but an opportunity we must seize that opportunity now not just to tackle the climate crisis or reach our nationally determine contribution for because net zero be about not just about we can not keep kick the can down the road somehow suggest we be go to meet our carbon budget meet they now today be absolutely vital to ensure we can meet our climate commitment in future carbon budget community energy be here and now we can get on with deliver net zero with the tool and technology we have and above all with the people we have individual and community across the country community energy england have group third of which would like to build onshore wind turbine like ambition lawrence weston they want to get on with it they be not often be pay to do this they do it because they recognise what they can return to their community as conservative who believe in the power of local community we as government should be support local community to the hilt to deliver on energy action when we look at the future of the grid everything point to the fact that create flexibility on the edge of the grid enhance our energy security allow we to return energy to the grid free up energy capacity elsewhere and free up our demand on oil and gas elsewhere this be no brainer shall support lords amendment if it be push to vote although will not push it to vote myself nevertheless it be vital that we send clear message not just that we be committed to the net zero pathway because it be the right and the economically important thing to do but that we recognise that when it come to net zero we need big bang moment we need to create little platoon of individual and community that be go out there write their own net zero narrative and story for that reason will be support this lords amendment today call the snp spokesman specious say his majesty opposition spokesperson about the argument against this amendment to which would add have listen to the minister defence of the government position on community energy that it be also one of the more tendentious argument that we have hear in this chamber be not convince that the minister be absolutely fully sign up to that which he have be put out today to defend think he know the importance of community generation and he be not content with the foot drag that his government be force he to come here to defend this be another extremely negative decision by government who show no let up in their disdain for community ambition for disaggregated generation infrastructure or in fact for the climate if we contrast that ambition with the tories now messianic devotion to the cult of nuclear we see that next year everyone across these island will be well shoot of they and nowhere more so will that be clear than in the energy space lord amendment be perfectly sensible ambition it be pragmatic amendment by their lordship it be balanced and deliverable work with the grain of local ambition and be destine to unlock significant value in the green transition it would unlock local enterprise and it would unlock value add in the real economy and promote community wellbee there be nothing not to recommend about this ambition it be quite clear that it have positive for the people and for our community it be no wonder then that this tory government will reject it out of hand they have no interest in empower the people or power the green revolution they would rather throw billion on to our energy bill to pay for nuclear while they proscribe onshore wind in england up until september this year leave scotland to do all the heavy lifting as usual why will these tories not follow the snp scottish government lead in this priority the scottish government community and renewable energy scheme promote community energy ownership across scotland cares continue to help community engage participate in and benefit from the transition to net zero since cares have offer advice and support to more than organisation and assist in the delivery of community and locally own renewable project throughout scotland offer funding in the process of million just to clarify that be just in scotland which rather put in the shade the million on offer from the english government to english community generation whenever that happen cares accelerate progress towards the scottish government target of gw of renewable energy to be locally or community own by the scheme assist in the delivery of both the scottish government energy strategy and heat in building strategy through the provision of loan finance grant funding and specialist advice in scotland we see government of the people work with the people for their share ambition but here in westminster we see only the veneer of an administration mask the infighting bitter division and self interest of that tory party the scottish government community good practice principle which have be widely adopt across the renewable industry promote the provision of community benefit at national level they promote the equivalent of per instal megawatt per annum index link for the life of the project over million have be pay out in community benefit to scottish community in the month since august england have very similar scheme but and it be big tory shaped but as these fund be in the great part principally bear of onshore wind development and the tories introduce de facto ban on onshore wind in english community have lose out on million and million of pound in community fund thank to this dysfunctional uk english government the government contort priority directly increase reliance on insecure and costly gas generation and they be continue to persist with the grotesque parody that they be on the side of work people by row back far on measure that would save household money and protect our planet by backtrack on home heating insulation and electric vehicle target the tories be busy damaging community damage investor confidence and damage the planet in the midst of an energy price crisis when low cost clean home produce energy have never be more important there be enormous potential across these island for growth in small scale renewable energy generation especially by community group that can provide cheap green power and then reinvest the profit locally community energy scheme currently generate mere of the uk electricity it be depressing this could grow twentyfold in year accord to study by the environmental audit committee but only if we get action from westminster government we must also bear in mind how much of that of community generation be thank to the foresight and financial investment of the scottish government investment that the scottish government must find from elsewhere in their budget because if the english government do not spend it it be not consequentialised that energy could power million home and save million tonne of emission year while create over job as member on the government own benches be point out these thing be not an impediment to economic growth but driver of economic growth furthermore they would reduce dependence on energy import all the while reduce reliance on foreign energy function uk government would embrace this remarkable potential accept the lords amendment and seek to enable rather than disable local supply the regulatory barrier that prevent community energy scheme from sell power to local customer be incongruous with both our climate emergency and the scale of current energy price the new million community energy fund be nothing but paltry smokescreen which will not scratch the surface and be veil simply for this tory government inaction and hostility to the ambition of the people and their drive for net zero the government can not hold candle to the scottish government record in this area but it be high time they at least try to do so let we remind ourselves what lords amendment be about within month of the act be pass the secretary of state would be require to carry out consultation and publish report on the barrier prevent the development of community energy scheme it would also require the government to respond and bring forward proposal to remove the barrier prevent the development of community energy scheme within six month of the consultation closing that be the bare minimum that the government could do it would at least move the issue forward and yet the government still put forward motion to disagree with it the government say that they have already commit to consult on the barrier to local supply but we still have not be give date when that will actually happen the lords amendment would stop the government current policy of dither and delay and require they to get on with take community energy scheme forward ultimately the government should not need to consult because they be already well aware of what barrier face the sector community energy england have tell they repeatedly over the last five year it be really disappointing because there be even an all party parliamentary group for community energy official have engage with the appg yet nothing have happen because the government despite warm word be not really commit to community energy in the environmental audit committee publish series of recommendation to encourage community energy the only recommendation take forward so far be the community energy fund and even that do not yet have launch date hope that the minister will tell when the launch date will be when will we see the fund for community energy we be in the middle of an energy crisis bill have skyrocket access to cheap clean home produce energy have never be more vital we need to secure our energy supply protect consumer and reach net zero as we have always say in the debate about reach net zero we need to take people with we that be not about delay target as the government have just do but about encourage people to walk the difficult journey to net zero community energy do exactly that why be the government not support it with all their might why be the government not even support the lords amendment it be the bare minimum community energy have the potential to power million home and save million tonne of carbon dioxide emission every year all it need be government who give it the support that it deserve have see at first hand the benefit that community energy can bring in my bath constituency bath and west community energy have instal enough renewable to power home it have invest the money that it have earn back into my local community donate nearly to support environmental and fuel poverty scheme that be what community energy can do what be there not to support why be the government not commit to do all that they can to ensure that community energy project can be deliver rise unfortunately the government be unwilling to see the potential of community energy community energy scheme currently generate just of the uk electricity that be because we know all this we have say it many time the financial technical and operational requirement involve in become licensed supplier put initial cost at more than million that be massive risk for any new start up or small scheme any community energy project such as the one in bath can exist only because it have reach certain size that be one of the problem the government be aware of that fact but vote to remove lords amendment to rectify it the government need to start match their supportive word about community energy with action the most effective step that they could take would be to enable local supply and remove the regulatory barrier that prevent community energy scheme from sell their power to local customer that could include community right to connect to the grid ahead of commercial project that deliver little or no social and community benefit be sure that have answer the question that the right hon member for wokingham john redwood be about to ask community energy scheme be ready to provide clean green energy that help local community they be not ask for huge amount of public money just for the government to stop block the system in this time of energy uncertainty have reliable local supplier can only be positive fully support lords amendment to hold the government foot to the fire on community energy urge everyone in this house to do the same thank all right hon and hon member for contribute to this afternoon debate will first respond to some of the comment make by my constituency neighbour the hon member for angus dave doogan know that he do not like it very much and would like it if it be not the case but he be absolutely wrong and have to correct he this be not the english government this be the british government we be the government of the entire united kingdom united kingdom of which scotland remain part and if the opinion poll be anything to go by will continue to remain part of for quite some time the hon member have an obsession with decry the nuclear industry as something that the tories alone be obsess with tell that to the government of france sweden finland italy poland the czech republic slovakia canada the united states of america and more who be reinveste and restart their own civil nuclear industry as be the labour welsh government who be very much in favour of further investment in and development of nuclear he raise the lack of funding for community energy project million over two year be an incredibly generous offer that be alongside other uk growth funding such as the uk share prosperity fund which community energy group can access by work in partnership with their local authority the hon member for bath wera hobhouse ask when the community energy fund will be launch it will be launch as soon as possible we be aim to launch application to the fund as soon as we physically can my opposite number the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead be right that we have have productive and constructive relationship when it come to discussion of the bill the hour that we spend together in committee be beneficial to everybody health be sure and to the development of government policy on this matter we have come some way from where we be when we start discuss how we would support community energy he rightly praise the role that the sector have play during the passage of the bill the community energy sector have be incredibly receptive to our commitment to consultation and to the million fund be grateful to the minister for give way do he notice that the hon member for bath wera hobhouse would not give way she be argue the typical position of her party that it know all the answer before the consultation yet it still want very long draw out consultation to avoid do the answer my right hon friend be absolutely right also notice that will the minister give way two second will respond to the first intervention before give way to the hon lady also notice that she manage to answer question that have not even be ask by my right hon friend the amendment also say that the government should respond to the barrier and put forward proposal that be really what we want to know what be the response to any consultation the government have fail to give any response to that we can not respond to consultation that have not be launch yet we be in the process right now of work with the community energy contact group in fact it have already meet work be under way right now to develop the consultation identify what the barrier to market be and get out there and support the community energy sector as the government be determined to do will the minister give way yes of course be delighted to give way the minister be very kind he be re emphasise the importance of the million community energy investment that he be make in england over two year the scottish government have be invest million every year for the last year if he think that his investment be outstanding how would he characterise the scottish government investment welcome all government investment in support of community energy project across the united kingdom but this be sharp change from the last time the hon member come to this place when he be decry the fact that we be not extend community energy package across the united kingdom think have to inform and educate he that there be already community benefit package in scotland operate by the scottish government yes there be problem with that scheme and we will learn from the difficulty that it have face that be why be so sure that the scheme that we be launch the million to support community energy project the length and breadth of the country be the right one work in tandem with the fund that be already available north of the border for community energy project in my constituency and indeed in his the hon member for southampton test speak about previous amendment on community energy we have be clear that they would not provide the good outcome for consumer right to local supply already exist and ofgem have exist flexibility to award supply licence that be restrict to certain geography we continue to believe that it be commercial matter leave to supplier lastly turn to my right hon friend the member for kingswood chris skidmore six month may be too soon frankly to adequately analyse the outcome of the consultation it must fully take into consideration wide interdependency in the energy system we will always aim to respond in timely manner but would not want to put strict timeframe in legislation the government support our route to net zero the government be take action to ensure that we be more energy secure and energy independent and the government be support community energy project the length and breadth of the country for that reason we should disagree to the lords amendment before we question put that this house disagree with lords amendment bim afolami adam afriyie peter aldous lucy allan lee anderson stuart anderson

committee that the committee do withdraw marson committee to withdraw immediately reason to be report and communicate to the lords civil aviation beg to move that the draft airports slot allocation alleviation of usage requirements no regulations which be lay before this house on july be approve to the casual and untutored eye this might seem very small piece of legislation to bring to the floor of the house of commons however it be not only important to the sector but useful illustration of the work of ministers and parliamentarian in committee so it be nice to have chance to focus on these quite technical and not especially controversial regulation the regulation will be make under power confer by the air traffic management and unmanned aircraft act which also rejoice in the name atmua follow the uk departure from the european union that legislation create more flexible set of power for ministers to implement alleviation measure for aircraft slot relate to the impact of subject to vote in both houses that allow the uk to adapt its approach so as to minimise disruption to consumer and support the recovery of the aviation sector under ordinary circumstance airline must operate aircraft slot of the time to retain the right to those same slot the follow year that be know as the rule or the use it or lose it rule it be design to encourage more efficient use of scarce airport capacity as result of the effect of on air travel demand however alleviation from the rule have be provide since summer the department have see strong recovery in passenger demand during but there remain uncertainty and lack of resilience in the industry and demand on some route remain below the level see before the pandemic those factor affect both demand such as the number of return passenger as well as supply such as aircraft availability and staffing they add to what have be term the long covid tail in rebuild resilience in the sector thus aircraft that be out of service during the pandemic now spend much long in maintenance and overhaul than would normally be the case that phenomenon be compound by difficulty stem from the pandemic which have affect access to spare part through global supply chain although the industry have take step to address those challenge they be expect to remain an issue during the government have therefore design package of measure for the winter season to mitigate the adverse effect of that loss of resilience the normal rule on slot usage have be retain however it have be combine with some limited flexibility through small pre season hand back allowance and continuation of the previously adopt measure on the justified non utilisation of slot the government have focus the measure on return to business as usual we be mindful of the need to balance support the sector through sensible and proportionate measure to aid its recovery and protect consumer from disruption with the need to avoid excessive alleviation which could distort competition there be two key provision the enhance justify non utilisation of slot provision be first introduce for winter they act as safety net for airline if new restriction be introduce and they can justify not use slot they protect the airline historic right to slot in scenario in which any reintroduce measure might severely reduce demand or the viability of route however for any request for justified non utilisation of slot rationale must be give to the independent co ordinator for assessment of its merit against the provision the second provision be limited slot hand back for this winter season the government will again allow carrier to claim alleviation on up to of their slot at any airport hand back before the start of the season as be do for this summer the government have offer that opportunity in the expectation that the industry will deliver realistic schedule for winter thereby minimise last minute cancellation and delay the opportunity to hand back slot before the start of the season have be particularly useful in ensure that airline deliver robust schedule and have help to provide certainty to consumer that schedule flight will operate the measure will cover the winter season the department for transport be consider whether further alleviation may be require for future season through these measure the government aim to strike balance between support the sector and minimise disruption to consumer while encourage recovery and ensure the efficient use of slot the minister say that the regulation before the house be small piece of legislation he be right and scholar of parliament will look back at this motion come to the floor of the house as strange occurrence usually we be up in the god in this place in draughty dusty committee room off long corridor in this great edifice but this government have run out of legislation to consider in those committee room and have to bring this to the floor of the house they have run out of time and they be fast run out of track when we talk about the general demise of transport in the united kingdom we can see that the government come to manchester to cancel they cancel it to my city in my city they announce tram to my constituency that be open in and they launch network north which sound like dodgy itv franchise and be do on the back of fag packet the industry be not impress by the fact that the secretary of state who be not here be make up conspiracy theory on the floor of the conference hall about mph zone and minute city the hon gentleman be very generous in give way but can ask he what part of his speech be to do with slot and aviation be come on to that this be about the general demise of transport about abandon the centre ground and abandon an industry we do not even have minister for aviation or for maritime in the house of commons whereas we in labour support aviation and maritime to the hilt when the secretary of state be make up those conspiracy theory the minister who be so keen on active travel he walk the walk talk the talk and rid his bike as well must have have his head in his hand we in labour offer industry reassurance and hope that thing will get well to respond to the right hon member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning let we talk about the motion at hand as we know the use it or lose it rule be relax throughout the pandemic it be drop to to ensure that no environmentally damaging ghost flight be take off that be the right decision slot be commercially important and highly prize by airline give they monopoly on route since the pandemic there have be strong recovery in passenger number and we be all grateful for that however the aviation industry can still exhibit lack of resilience and some uncertainty at time and some route be still not yet at capacity the pandemic have leave airline and airport with little resilience and tight staffing number and as the minister have mention there be issue with aircraft availability and the global supply chain with the benefit of hindsight the government failure to support our world class aviation sector during the pandemic have lead we here we as well as workforce representative and union warn the government that if ten of thousand of skilled train worker be sack or let go during the pandemic it would be nigh on impossible to get back up to full speed to be dynamic and react to industry demand the two main provision in the regulation act as safety net for airline the first allow they to justify not use slot if new restriction be to be introduce on particular route of course hope that that will never be necessary but if it should be what datum and metric will be use do the minister have an agree plan with industry on this the other main provision be limit slot hand back of up to of all slot which be to be hand back before the start of the season the justification for that be to ensure minimum delay and cancellation for consumer however the autumn timetable begin in just day the explanatory memorandum say that passenger be expect to benefit from the relief contain in the legislation by retain good level of historic connectivity but also point out the downside of this provision potential negative impact on the marketplace the regulation be important to enable more airline to deliver realistic winter schedule and should minimise the cancellation and delay that have blight the industry over the past few year as reference early many of those problem be predict and avoidable we can not hollow out skilled workforce with security requirement and expect there to be no impact on the consumer can the minister update on the work the government have do to strengthen consumer right ensure that passenger be pay compensation and refund that they be entitle to in timely fashion we know that many airline sit on ten of million of pound worth of voucher that be claim during the pandemic which be due to run out for customer these measure be bring in under exceptional circumstance in previous debate of this nature with one of the minister predecessor back in it be say that it would take until for air traffic volume to increase back to level believe the current figure be that on average we be at around of those level do the government have plan for what they will do in march four year after the first debate of this nature take place the sector have still not bounce back fully in may this year raise the point that the government approach be very short term one and even take that into consideration impact assessment be not be fully carry out the minister at the time assure that the government would continue to monitor impact as they go have they be do so and what be their finding be still keen to see retrospective assessment of the impact of the measure to ensure that these step be proportionate neither too harsh nor too weak have the extraordinary circumstance we find ourselves in in now become the norm in the aviation sector early this year the minister suggest that there would be consultation on slot reform later in the year could be update on the progress of that consultation have previously raise and will continue to raise the issue of airspace modernisation which know be something the minister be keen on when he hold that post that issue need to be address strategically so when will we see more progress on it we could cut carbon tomorrow by or if we upgrade our airspace we have an analogue system in digital age as passenger demand be still in recovery phase and we feel the hangover of the covid pandemic industry wide it be more important than ever to consider way to future proof our airspace and achieve low emission in the process be thrilled that this statutory instrument be be take in the house where can talk about it rather than up on the committee corridor because would probably not have be select to sit on that committee on slot my constituent be very concerned at the moment not least about luton airport which have blight my constituency with its overflying that do not affect the town of luton at all even though the airport be own by luton council the flight massively affect the northern part of my constituency particularly markyate flamstead and the gaddesdens of course we have terrible situation at the moment with thousand of car still trap at luton airport after the horrendous fire there my constituent still can not get to their vehicle and they do not know when they will be able to flight be arrive and take off but there be still massive problem with parking because the airport be never design to be the size it be now rise to speak on this because the government have make decision be pleased it be call in and the decision be not make by luton council that there will be massive expansion of flight from luton airport appreciate that this be not in the minister portfolio but use to be the shadow minister and know how it be for someone on the front bench this may not be in his portfolio but be afraid he be go to cop it it be ridiculous decision to allow luton airport to expand when there be so many complaint from resident not from luton we have see the problem with the fire but the airport be just not design to be this size and it be not geographically suitable be not hypocrite have fly from luton airport in the past yes have what have this get to do with slot hate to say this to the shadow minister but this be about slot at luton airport in labour control constituency which think he might be interested in because my constituent really be just want to put on the record that increase slot will cause increase pollution and increase noise for my constituent the decision to allow increase number of flight the expansion will almost double luton airport be fundamentally oppose by and it will be very sad day when it go ahead call the snp spokesperson have be so look forward to this debate now an annual debate on airport slot it be very good of the leader of the house to invite we into the big room to discuss it although be not sure how much this will pad out this session of parliament to be perfectly honest have speak about this issue many time before will not be speak for long because of my voice and ironically because be suppose to be meet an airline as we speak the other reason will not be speak for long be that this be to do with the eight slot co ordinate airport not one of which be in scotland however we clearly have huge interest in this with domestic flight indeed if the government be to bring forward legislation on guarantee slot for domestic travel particularly to london airport from glasgow airport in my constituency would be grateful indeed clearly we be not go to oppose this motion the government be display uncharacteristic common sense in this motion so it be one we will be support shocking indeed it chill to the bone to support tory legislation but here be do just that will not repeat all the question ask by the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane they include question on consumer right which he so skilfully shoehorn into debate on airport slot so congratulate he on that in particular he raise the issue of airspace modernisation which have raise number of time over the year and have push this government on they really need to get grip on modernisation and push on but look forward to the minister answer interruption hope he be pay attention because be about to sit down we will support he and look forward to his answer to hon member question we liberal democrats be supportive of relax the rule during covid we could not have allow airline to fly empty flight just so they could keep their slot the situation be now more complex the dysfunction in the aviation industry now be just as much about managerial capacity failing as it be about the problem stem from the pandemic there have be numerous allegation of abuse of the temporary rule by some airline to flex their muscle in the marketplace we must guard against anti competitive practice which make it hard for new entrant to enter the market allege attempt to hoard valuable heathrow slot have an impact on the availability choice and price of flight airline airport and travel operator be one of the big single contributor to global emission it be crucial that we ensure that flight be take off only when there be proper demand for they there have be recovery in passenger demand but there be continue uncertainty and lack of resilience in the industry recruitment remain challenge demand on some route remain below pre pandemic level and change to our working pattern have cause drop in business travel we must accept that these new pattern be the norm the motion propose package of measure for the winter season that let the normal use it or lose it rule stay however there remain some limited flexibility for airline to keep hold of their carrier slot at airport through small pre season hand back allowance of and continuation of the previously adopt justified non utilisation of slot measure although we be broadly supportive of the government plan we be concerned that there have not be parity of government support for public transport the rail industry and public transport such as bus be also face change market railway still face billion annual fare shortfall from pre covid day that the government be unwilling to fill the bus and coach industry be experience driver shortage there be no justification for the government to protect just one industry from inefficiency and uncertainty in the market and they must outline timeline for when the covid mitigation give to airline will come to an end why prioritise aviation over other mode of transportation airline need clarity and time to prepare but there must come point when the government tell industry that it need to get on with thing itself it be delight to wind up this debate and thank colleague who have speak in what have be brief but deep and thoughtful exchange the hon member for bath wera hobhouse rightly point to the anti competitive potential of these measure and also highlight their modesty and therefore the sensitivity she be absolutely right about that she be also right in her concern about ghost flight at the risk of violently agree across the chamber think she be also right on the question of how long these measure will continue for will address that issue far in my remark the snp spokesman the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands be right to point out that there be no direct scottish interest in this and thank he as thank the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane for support this conservative legislation hope it become habit for the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north as it have do for his former colleague my hon friend the member for east kilbride strathaven and lesmahagow dr cameron think that be useful development in snp politic my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning interruption that be what say say my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead as the record will show be very sorry to hear again about the situation that his constituent have face in relation to what happen at luton absolutely take on board and the house will have note his comment and concern about expansion and its impact locally he will appreciate that as with active travel the bus and coach sector and other item raise in the debate that issue have nothing to do with the subject of this debate and he be rightly critical of those who would crowbar in thing that be not relevant however the concern of any colleague be always relevant if it be direct constituency matter he be right to raise it and thank he for that thank the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east for his support as my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead say the joy of have this debate on the floor of the house of commons be that wide range of colleague can come and express concern and we can shine little light on the statutory legislative process which be of enormous importance to the conduct of this house and the two chambers of parliament the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east ask about the metric for use in relation to non utilisation those be set out in the excitingly entitle principle of slot allocation document at section which concern the justified non utilisation of slot and those be the rule to respond to his question about slot obviously there be consultation to be launch in due course but those be the rule as they stand in relation to work on consumer right my right hon friend will be aware that on june the government publish our response to the aviation consumer policy reform consultation which set out legislative reform and non legislative measure to ensure that passenger receive the good service possible among the non legislative measure be considerable range of effort to work with industry on variety of measure design to accelerate and speed up the protection of those right he be absolutely right in relation to the use of these measure in future baroness vere of norbiton the aviation minister say in the house of lords recently that she be ask herself the question as to when these measure would wind up and she hop it would be soon think that represent the government position it be true that we have consultation plan on slot reform member will also note that the level of consultation that inform this set of measure be well spell out in the explanatory memorandum to the legislation and that set out in some detail what conversation and discussion have be have with the industry and it provide fairly compelling background to these modest but flexible measure thank my right hon friend for allow to intervene be one of those people who come in here just to listen because this debate be not be hold in dusty corridor somewhere upstairs be here to learn understand from my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning that the ministry decide the number of slot but who decide who get those slot be it the airport or some other body have sit down but be happy to take late question from my colleague the number of slot derive from historical control over and entitlement to slot at exist airport but there be also mechanism for reallocating slot that have be hand back and for allocate slot when they become available those be conduct by an independent process and review by an independent process and there be no plan in this legislation to make any change to that go back to my speech early and the increase in slot at luton airport can the minister indicate when the increase in flight will start to occur so that can inform my constituent how much of their life be go to be blight even more by the flight from luton airport be not sure quite catch the force of the question because be be interrupt when my right hon friend speak what be the timescale for the increase in slot from luton airport now that the government have give permission for the expansion of luton airport that will have massive impact on my constituent and would like to inform they factually about what be go on exist slot will follow the procedure lay out in the legislation as regard future slot they will be allocate accord to the consultation that we will be launch shortly should say that this be the last intervention will take madam deputy speaker since have sit down before the two previous one question put and agree to business without debate speaker committee for the independent parliamentary standards authority ordered that lucy powell be appoint to the speaker committee for the independent parliamentary standards authority in place of thangam debbonaire until the end of the present parliament in pursuance of paragraph of schedule to the parliamentary standards act as mordaunt order the house will now be suspend pende the announcement of the result of

fellow lancashire member of parliament in the chair in fact we have go from one transport debate to another albeit with rather large gap in between as lancashire mp yourself you be more than well aware of the issue on our county rail network and of the need for modernisation of the infrastructure and roll stock indeed you have fight diligently on behalf of your constituent for exactly the improvement that be fight for for mine today be pleased to be able to raise the subject of the south fylde line it be raise repeatedly not only on the doorstep but at local event and in write correspondence just stand on the platform at preston station people come up to and say we need to do well than this throughout my time as member of parliament have fight to improve service in this we have see progress the dilapidated pacer train which use to deposit waste directly on to the track be thankfully thing of the past in be delighted to reopen the modernised kirkham and wesham station follow the installation of new platform and two lift serve it provide at long last station that be accessible to all thank my really good friend for allow to intervene may say that be delighted to hear that news last go to that station in july when be go to the nearby weeton camp have to say that it be show slight age then and so some year later be really glad that it have be modernise colonel bob not only have it be modernise but still speak to constituent who remember you pass through in once my right hon friend the member for bexleyheath beckenham sorry once my right hon friend the member for beckenham bob stewart have pass through he be never forget the holy grail remain however the doubling of service on the line through the installation of pass loop and be concerned that effort in that area have frankly stall in june submit full restore your railway bid to double train service on the south fylde line the bid be one of submit with the then chancellor now the prime minister select it to be take forward with government funding to help to put together strategic outline business case the sobc be submit in november and since then there have be no further progress or communication from the department my fellow bid partner and feel slightly abandon with even the formal email address of restore your railway now close my purpose today be therefore to seek assurance that the project continue to have the government backing the year of hard work that go into reach that stage must not be allow to fall by the wayside early this year launch the campaign to get the south fylde line back on track will give some context to where we find ourselves today first open in the little over decade on from stephenson rocket the history of the south fylde line parallel the story of victorian britain and our railway more generally major expansion come in the latter decade of the with new station open to serve the booming victorian holiday industry that be grow in fylde not just in the beach resort and the residential community that spring up alongside they they provide vital link for those commute to liverpool greater manchester and the great mill town of east lancashire where industry be boom the post war era see our railway enter period of decline with the rise of car and dwindle passenger number and of course dr beeching cut would soon follow despite that the south fylde line survive as two track line until the when the axe finally fall and the line be reduce to single track capable of serve one train an hour in each direction recent year have see something of consensus reach around beeching and the period of his cutback and the closure that start with his report they be mistake to echo the prime minister recent word they be an example of an old consensus that favour car over public transport as the minister know from our correspondence on the topic the south fylde line fall far short of what be satisfactory and be even far from be good service reliability be major issue with one delay have an impact on service for the rest of the day and single track be neither the only issue nor the sole reason for the reliability issue be it staff sickness driver shortage faulty train or signal issue fylde commuter have hear it all on weekday evening rail replacement service have become an increasingly common occurrence turn minute train journey from lytham to preston into one last almost an hour in addition northern cut the frequency of weekend service in august the peak of the summer tourist season for reason that remain unclear to recent datum from on time train list st annes on the sea as the rank station for reliability with all station locate beyond the line division at kirkham and wesham rank similarly remarkably that be an improvement from august when the station fall outside the top out of just open railway station across the uk that be miserable read for fylde commuter and the many people who choose fylde as holiday destination the train be afraid be an unreliable option for they my hon friend be articulate very well the problem on the line regard punctuality which we have see for far too long of course our aspiration for the south fylde line be not just to improve punctuality but to double the number of train that run on the line every hour in both our constituency that would be of huge benefit to local tourism business in term of create job inward investment and growth in our local economy we both work so hard to get the feasibility funding that be deliver now over three year ago would he urge our brilliant rail minister to do everything that he can to try to look at creative solution around the capacity issue at preston so that we can finally take the project forward and both our constituency can benefit my hon friend hit the nail on the head blackpool south get huge number of visitor blackpool pleasure beach have its own train station yet people choose not to take the train to one of the big visitor attraction in the uk they come by other mean it be absolutely ludicrous it be real privilege to be able to welcome my hon friend as he row in behind my ongoing campaign for the south fylde line it be great when colleague be work together for the same cause it add huge value as the sobc point out the ranking be base only on service that be formally record as cancel service turn around before reach the end of the line be not include yet at blackpool south between march and march this occur time the equivalent of day worth of service that do not complete the route the problem have not go away for the station not serve these be effectively cancellation yet they do not appear in the statistic as such official figure be therefore significantly understate the problem may no long be come to preston but link across lancashire and to nearby city such as liverpool and manchester remain important in addition the west coast main line continue to offer frequent and relatively fast route to glasgow edinburgh birmingham and london the cost of those train be such that most people reserve seat on specific train to have the certainty they need about their arrival time which they simply do not have on south fylde line service the line travel through the heart of my constituency and we be deeply proud of it we have several active friend group who work tirelessly to improve station such as lytham st anne on the sea and squires gate want to see more people on the train so that they can see and appreciate the work of the friend group one need only read local author steve garrill walks from the south fylde line or community rail lancashire discover the south fylde line to discover the trove of activity be they leisure cultural or entertainment within reach of the line whether relax on st annes beach and walk over the sand dune take in the estuary view from lytham green or test your golfing skill at the world class royal lytham coastal fylde have so much to offer and be magnet for day tripper and holidaymaker alike beyond lytham st annes be blackpool pleasure beach one of the country big visitor attraction we also have thriving night time economy all these activity be serve by the unreliable and infrequent service on the south fylde line as well as its fantastic hospitality and tourism offering fylde be vibrant economic hub and the rail line that serve it be vital for countless people commute into or around fylde and on to destination beyond short walk from salwick station we have springfields for year the home of british nuclear fuel manufacturing and site that be prim to grow with the industry expansion in the drive for net zero this season afc fylde have return to the national league the fifth tier of english football swell crowd indeed one of my london base researcher tell about his experience of leave mid week match at the start of injury time in the hope of catch the pm train miss the train by mere second and instead have an hour wait on the platform for the next one similarly supporter of nearby blackpool and preston north end will have have frustrating experience get to and from match despite the club stadium lie short distance from the south fylde line know from my time on the transport committee that my hon friend the minister be passionate and have fight to ensure that his corner of east sussex be serve by service that meet the need of his constituent be privileged to have respond to this debate minister who understand the issue when we serve together on that committee he be never frightened of challenge the industry and hold it to account and shin light on shoddy inadequate service he do that for his constituent be do it for mine let we consider comparison between bexhill in the south east of england and fylde lancashire bexhill have hourly train to both london and brighton double to two in each direction during peak hour with several additional train to eastbourne hastings and ashford international battle see twice hourly service to london and hastings with an additional london train service run during peak time even robertsbridge in my hon friend the minister constituency village that with population of just over be comparable to wrea green in my constituency be connect to both london and hastings by two train an hour in each direction during peak time with just of service cancel that be the kind of connectivity that the minister enjoy he have fight for it but the kind of which fylde constituent can only dream be sure that he share my resolve to put that right in response to the recent reliability issue that mention run survey of my constituent to seek feedback on that topic will share couple of example that be representative of wide feedback and illustrate my point these be the comment of constituent love to be able to travel from ansdell to my office in liverpool but with one train an hour mean often poor connection and then that one train be prone to cancellation it rare that feel can risk it so end up drive to preston which be long and park more expensive that do nothing to help our carbon footprint another say if the train be reliable then would use they but after have to find contingency plan at the last moment on too many occasion no long put myself through the stress of use they unfortunately often have to drive to preston to rescue strand family member when train be cancel with no reason the train timetable we have at the moment fail to connect with the train timetable go north and south if be go to london have to spend almost an hour wait on very cold and miserable platform and the same happen when return likewise when travel to lancaster and further north why would do it would park my car at preston station and drive that be just madness it all come at an environmental and financial cost not to mention that it increase traffic on our road at busy time the inefficiency of have to drive to the mainline station at preston dozen or so mile away will not be lose on my hon friend the minister passenger number be relatively low which contend be direct result of the infrequency and unreliability of the train and have believe lead to under investment in the line vicious circle that we must now break if level up be to be more than slogan people in fylde should not have to continue put up with such abject service let we look to the future and possible solution to refer back to the prime minister wholeheartedly agree with his statement that what we really need be well transport connection in the north the cap on bus fare be fantastic and be grateful to the government for their investment in fylde road the new preston west distributor road the edith rigby way have open along with new junction to the while the link road know as the moss road and the singleton bypass be fast approach completion however as mention at the start of the debate the holy grail remain return to twice hourly train on the south fylde line the most efficient way to achieve that be the installation of pass loop around ansdell enable train to pass each other roughly halfway through the line route we be not ask for anything extravagant indeed many of my constituent still remember time when that line be dual track and service be more frequent there be not pass loop the whole thing be dual track as such believe that my ask on behalf of my constituent be modest realistic and above all deliverable in timely way the scrapping of the northern leg of in favour of investing in the road and rail connection that link our community in the north deliver great new chance to see this project become reality with billion be allocate to local authority to spend on project in these area there be an opportunity to deliver last change for community such as deliver on the levelling up promise of recent year as the minister will recall when write to he this summer one key obstacle he mention be the need to reserve capacity at preston to allow certain platform to be use for future service that problem have now be make obsolete by the prime minister recent decision the previously submit bid which date back to give three option for the project range from million to million those figure do not include the redevelopment of the former royal mail parcel platform at preston for passenger service which would instead have be carry out as part of arrival nor do they account for the inflation of the past two year which have be particularly acute in the transport construction sector welcome that money but with it be divide across the country and cost no doubt have rise the government may well still need to step in to support and help fund this critical project rail connectivity be both our past and our future investment in it can
