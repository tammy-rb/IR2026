crime in hyndburn and haslingden be currently out of control robbery have skyrocket in my constituency by in the past year which be far bad than the already shocking increase that we have see across lancashire shoplifting have soar by which again be significantly bad than the rise across the county those number be not just statistic they represent victim business owner whose livelihood be threaten family who feel unsafe and community tear apart by lawlessness indeed just last week local business in accrington see around break in almost half of my experience violent crime that be unacceptable and be speak here today because refuse to accept it any long just over the weekend an awful video have sadly be circulate on social medium of yet another terrible incident of violent crime in hyndburn this government crime and policing bill be the big crackdown on crime in decade we be take back our town centre from thug and thief and restore respect for law and order give our community and police the tool they need to fight back for too long the crime that have make accrington town centre almost lawless the so call low level offence have be ignore when shoplift antisocial behaviour and street crime go unpunished our high street suffer our economy decline and our community start to lose hope accrington be once thrive hub it have be neglect for too long but these new power for the police be key to turn that around the bill deliver real action the police will no long need warrant to search premise when steal good be track electronically and there will be no more safe haven for criminal respect order will clamp down on public drinking and drug taking ensure that our street be no long place of disorder officer will have the power to seize nuisance vehicle such as the off road bike see on friday tear up our park in rishton on the spot crucially the day of treat theft under with effective immunity be over stealing be steal and criminal will be hold to account it be also welcome that the government listen to the campaign organise by the union of shop distributive and allied workers and other shop worker for the introduction of new offence of assault shop worker in this vital bill the labour government be not just tough on crime they be invest in solution welcome the provision of new police officer to ensure that every community have its name police officer this be part of the government million investment which will deliver funding uplift in lancashire enough be enough the people of hyndburn and haslingden deserve safe street thrive town centre and the right to live without fear the bill deliver that and be proud to support it welcome many of the measure in the bill particularly those concern knife crime and the protection of shop worker who all too often bear the brunt of antisocial behaviour however one of the big deterrent for criminal be the certainty of be catch and reduction in police number nationally be as wrong as they be locally in avon and somerset the former conservative police and crime commissioner cut pcso by further last year massive reduction and close our taunton police report march vol welcome clause provision on public space protection order which will come on to welcome the commitment to deliver extra officer of various kind but worry for be the fact that my constituent have come to see about their relative who be serve police officer civilian have be replace by officer in uniform do the same civilian job just so that it can be claim that police number have increase hope the minister will make sure that that do not continue to occur with the new recruitment which be very welcome unless officer be see in our community and on the street they will not deter or catch the criminal we need they to catch last autumn be contact by business in castle green in taunton which be at their wit end because of the antisocial behaviour in the historic centre of our county town contact the chief constable straightaway be really grateful to avon and somerset officer for the effort they have put in as be to the chamber of commerce in taunton which have raise the general issue of town centre crime and convene the safe street forum that attend last week but it be clear that we need to deter antisocial behaviour and crime where it be take place that be prove by the fact that lib dem run taunton town council have just appoint street marshal who be on duty in our town centre spend the afternoon with nick last friday he be do an excellent job and cover huge range of work from people climb all over the rooftop to retrieve thousand of pound worth of stock by simply ask the person responsible to hand it over he must have be quite persuasive in ask the individual to do that congratulate nick our street marshal but when return to castle green with he it be clear that the antisocial behaviour problem there have become intractable therefore suggest that we need to work with somerset council to get public space protection order and hope the government will support its enforcement too many of our great community event be mar by the antisocial few and we need to tackle that we need the public space of castle green with its superb independent market our famous castle hotel the schedule ancient monument which be the castle itself and the museum of somerset where soon people will be able to see the chew valley hoard of silver coin from the norman conquest can not use those coin to pay for the enforcement of the public space protection order but hope it will have government support so that we can ensure that key public space be not subject to conquest by those who would disobey the law wreak havoc among local people damage livelihood and tarnish the generally superb reputation of our county town
