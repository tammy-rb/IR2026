spend in the region to improve local transport infrastructure and the rail investment we be make as part of the trans pennine route upgrade the secretary of state know that high speed central purpose be to deliver economic growth but she know too that it be take far long and cost far more to deliver than anyone expect give that project of the scale of require parliamentary approval be it not important that parliament have accurate estimate of how much the project will cost and how long it will take to deliver will she commission properly independent and thorough review of why the budget for have increase so often and the timetable have expand so often will be provide update to the house on the emerge cost position and opening window as the right hon and learn gentleman will know this government have appoint new chief executive of mark wild who be conduct an ongoing review we have also reintroduce ministerial oversight which be sorely lack under the conservative party leadership recognise that this be an important issue and we be do all we can to deliver the rest of this railway at the low reasonable cost to the taxpayer so that people can enjoy excellent rail service in the future the transport secretary recently refuse to commit to keep the cap on bus fare outside london beyond the end of this year leave many in rural area worry about how much more they will end up have to pay to get to work resident across my constituency have already see vital route scrap or scale back hold back economic growth can the transport secretary explain what support will be make available to not only keep rural fare down but restore lose service the hon lady will know that this government step in to prevent soar bus fare increase give the last government decision to only fund bus fare

need call the shadow minister greater anglia support economic growth in the east of england with modern quiet fast train pay for by billion of private sector investment its service be the most punctual in the country it be popular with its passenger and it be run so efficiently that instead of cost the taxpayer it pay money into the treasury it be currently train operator of the year greater anglia know that nationalisation be come and it have offer to extend its operation to allow the government to focus on the bad perform operator first why do the government refuse be the secretary of state focus on improve the life of passenger or be it an ideological determination to put the union back in charge of the railway really do not know how many time have to say this to the hon gentleman meet he couple of day ago and explain that our process for bring train operating company into public ownership be design to offer good value for money to the taxpayer we will not be buy out fail private sector operator by break contract early he be right to say that greater anglia provide an excellent service and be confident we will build on that when it come into public ownership in october perhaps the secretary of state do not understand the nature of the offer from greater anglia it be not expect to be buy out it be offer to continue its current arrangement for couple of year in previous answer the secretary of state say to that the benefit of rail nationalisation will be the million of efficiency saving let see how that be go her first nationalisation will be south western railway in two week time that new service will need train yet the telegraph have reveal that inept contract negotiation by her department where there be no effective competition mean that the cost of re lease the same train be increase by million over five year be those the efficiency saving she have in mind the up to million of saving that the taxpayer can enjoy as result of train operating company come back into public ownership be the save management fee that we be currently pay to private sector operator and efficiency will be deliver on top of that on the substantive issue that the hon gentleman raise about south western railway the cost of renew roll stock lease have be fully and properly budget for with successful commercial negotiation recently conclude the franchising process under his government see some buy now pay later deal do on roll stock where cost be always expect to increase think that approach be deeply dubious but that be the short termist

issue north wales and its surround region have such huge potential so be actively engage with the welsh government on plan to create transport system that meet the need of all our community and deliver economic growth rail play vital role in the north wales economy so welcome the recent announcement of additional service per week between holyhead and london however that remain shadow of the pre covid timetable which see up to daily direct service the north wales line regularly see more cancellation and poor reliability than other part of the west coast franchise it be vital that with economic growth tourism and access to employment across north wales and beyond we see return to more frequent and reliable service pattern what measure be the secretary of state take to ensure that that happen the uplift in service level between london and holyhead from this sunday be indeed welcome and agree that reliable service be deliver for the passenger of north wales be vital for economic growth recognise that wales have not see its fair share of funding historically and be committed to continue rail infrastructure investment in wales to release capacity and improve reliability the

acknowledge that that have happen network rail be fund to progress automatic route set signal technology to far enhance performance across the brighton main line further decision will be make after the spending review aviation sector what step she be take to support the aviation sector we be unlock growth by progress airport planning decision and invite third runway proposal for heathrow by the summer new uk airspace design service and support fund will drive airspace modernisation we introduce the sustainable aviation fuel mandate and yesterday we propose revenue certainty mechanism to support uk production saxonair norwich airport and norfolk and suffolk county council recently launch aviation east call to make east anglia the heart of aviation innovation we be already lead in the development of electric aircraft and the early availability of sustainable aviation fuel but we could do so much more to unlock growth and deliver job will the minister outline how this government will support aviation in the east be due to meet he soon but will he also come to norwich take flight in an electric plane and see what innovation be under way this government want to see the uk maximise the benefit of the future of flight technology include fly taxi both for the economy and for community we recently announce over million of government funding for the civil aviation authority and the future flight challenge to deliver the future flight programme this year that joint programme between industry government and the caa will enhance drone capability by with fly taxi in the uk sky by would be delighted to visit norwich and the airport in my hon friend constituency as the minister be well aware the government have support and sign off on the development consent order for manston airport in my constituency it be hop and expect that the final private funding for that package will be in place and that work will start in the very near future will the minister now reaffirm his support for the contribution that manston can and will make to freight and growth in the united kingdom and can he also seek to expedite the necessary licence at the appropriate time be delighted to spend my easter holiday in the right hon member constituency cycle the cantii way stop and take look at manston airport and sip of water from my bottle because it be hot day be look forward to the outcome of the talk and the funding and at that point will be happy to look at the proposal from manston and sit down with the right hon member to unlock that capacity my hon friend will be as aware as be that the air passenger duty which be introduce by conservative chancellor more than year ago have be study intensively every study show that the revenue generate by that tax be much less than the benefit of abolish it will my hon friend and the secretary of state try to talk some sense into the chancellor of the exchequer and her official to get rid of this tax and benefit both aviation and the economy would never disagree with the former leader of my council but on this occasion might have to pay tribute to my hon friend as somebody who be chairman of the airport that deliver the only international runway in this country in year air passenger duty be part of the rich mix of the aviation tapestry however last month in april heathrow have million passenger through its door the large number ever most airport and airline be see demand go through the roof we be modernise the airspace decarbonise the fuel and unlock the constraint on our airport which be why we be see record passenger number recognise the vital importance of the aviation sector but any airport expansion include at bristol airport should reflect the cumulative impact of emission and our legal commitment to net zero do the minister support the climate change committee advice publish last year that no airport expansion should proceed without uk wide capacity management framework first congratulate bristol on the excellent job it be do and the growth it be see we have strict criterion on carbon emission noise growth and pollution at our airport that be our guide principle as government but we also want to see local ambition in term of growth those carbon budget be fix we still want to reach net zero by even with the growth in our air market that be expect over the next few year call the shadow secretary of state as we approach the summer holiday we know that many family be look forward to the opportunity to get away however in what may come as concern news labour employment rights bill could threaten passenger ability to travel without disruption or additional cost this be because in exist passenger right legislation under article of regulation passenger be entitle to compensation if they be inform of cancellation less than two week before their flight the employment rights bill reduce the require notice period for strike action in any industry from day to day increase the risk of last minute cancellation that could in theory cost airline ten of million of pound which could in turn lead to high cost for passenger as airline pass the expense on to the travel public do the minister agree that the government should maintain the day notice period in aviation put the interest of passenger ahead of those of their union friend the shadow secretary of state will forgive if have not read that sub paragraph that trip off the tongue this government will always put passenger first that be why more passenger than ever be fly in our sky and leave our airport the department be fully engage with the aviation sector at all stage include on this issue drive test backlog what step she be take to reduce the backlog for drive test last month the secretary of state announce further measure to tackle the unacceptable driving test backlog include double training capacity for drive test examiner and offer overtime pay incentive to provide extra test that will create up to

that people be struggle to book test due to shortage of examiner will she provide we with an update follow the instruction make last year to the driver and vehicle standards agency to double the number of examiner be train my hon friend be right to raise this issue we be hold the dvsa to account for successfully implement the measure in last december seven point plan some new driving examiner have already pass their training and be work in drive test centre and last year the dvsa provide million test this month it will launch an accelerated consultation on improvement to the test booking system to end the reselling of test and the exploitation of learner which be completely unacceptable do the minister acknowledge that part of what have happen as result of the pressure test have be displacement of learner driver to test centre in rural area where they perceive that there might be less waiting time that be prejudice against local applicant will she do everything she can to ensure that local applicant for test get priority the right hon gentleman raise an important point we know that people be book test in part of the country where they have no intention of take test because they can swap that for test in another driving test centre that be one of the issue address in the call for evidence that be launch in december we have hear that evidence and we will consult on further change to the booking system that might address the issue that he raise call the shadow minister at the transport committee in april the secretary of state admit that under labour watch wait time for access to drive test hit new high for all the talk of new plan she then admit that the government only aim to reduce driving test wait time to seven week by summer next year that be no good for young people wait need the freedom to drive to get to college or work now be it when will the government see the real urgency for real people and pick up the pace we be act to fix the mess that the shadow minister government leave behind our seven point plan be be implement and last month the secretary of state announce additional measure we be determined to succeed where the last government fail do not think the minister have get the memo that she be in charge now the government can not hide behind the same old excuse and try to blame other as average test volume be now low on month by month basis than they be in the previous two year in quarter alone nearly few test be conduct than in the same period in the average waiting time for drive test in the uk sit at week over five month that be up from week in july and week in february for all the government promise there have be no actual delivery why have capacity not increase or at the very least stay the same as when we be in charge the hon gentleman be not listen we be implement the seven point plan but turn around the mess and the problem that the conservatives leave we take time be determined that we will see the result that waiting time will come down and that we will support learner driver it can not be do overnight when we be try to fix year of mess pavement parking what recent discussion she have have with local

and respect very much that you be stand up for parliament which be exactly the right thing to do applaud that recall offender sentencing limits urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make statement on the public safety implication of the government plan to set day limit on prison sentence for recall offender the lord chancellor lay write ministerial statement yesterday the background to which be the change around fix term recall in the light of the prison capacity challenge that the government face when we be elect almost year ago we inherit prison system on the brink of collapse although we take immediate action to prevent the catastrophe prison continue to be perilously close to fill up entirely last december we publish long term building strategy set out our aim to open up prison place by that be the large expansion of the prison estate since the victorians we have already commit billion to prison expansion and since take office we have deliver new place we also commission the independent sentencing review which will report shortly the sentencing review will hopefully offer we path to end the capacity crisis in our prison for good but the impact of sentencing reform will not be feel before next spring on our current trajectory we will hit zero capacity in our prison in november we can not allow that to happen that be why we have announce our intention to lay fix term recall statutory instrument that will mean that those serve sentence of between one and four year can only be return to prison for fix day period the measure build on previous legislation introduce by the last government that mandate day recall for those serve sentence of under year to be clear high risk offender have be exempt from that change if further information relate to an offender risk be receive after they have be recall which mean they be no long consider suitable for fix term recall they may be detain for long on standard recall if that be assess as necessary call the shadow secretary of state sorry seem to be the hard word today see that the justice secretary have still not come to parliament to defend her policy yesterday she deliberately avoid scrutiny in this house because she know that this decision be wildly unpopular and risk the safety of the public to govern be to choose there be foreign criminal in our jail and people in prison await trial combine those two group make up roughly third of the prison population the sensible step forward would obviously be to introduce emergency measure to expedite deportation and get the court sit around the clock if the justice secretary choose to do that we would support she but so far she have not she have refuse to take the judiciary up on its offer of extra court sitting day it be not uncommon for as many as half the court at the old bailey to sit empty on any give day instead she have decide to let out early criminal who reoffend or breach their licence there be now no punishment or deterrent for criminal who immediately reoffend or cheat the system the justice secretary say these people will be in prison outside of be sure that harden criminal will be quake in their boot at that farcical doublespeak there be no two way about it this decision have put the public in danger and victim in jeopardy the domestic abuse commissioner nicole jacobs have say that she can not stress enough the lack of consideration for victim safety and how many life be be put in danger be the justice secretary or her minister really tell domestic abuse victim that their abuser will be back on the street in just day if they breach their licence and that nobody will even check with the parole board can the minister explain to the house who be exempt from the scheme because right now confusion reign yesterday the justice secretary give the impression that no domestic abuser or sexual offender would be eligible for her scheme but her department have since say that it will include many but not all the write ministerial statement lay yesterday deliberately conceal the answer to the question of which criminal will be exclude so will the minister take this opportunity to tell the house if he do not know the answer will he commit to publish it by the end of the day lastly can he confirm to the house that anyone in breach of restraining order will be ineligible for fix term recall because anything else would be an insult to the victim since take office we have deport over foreign national offender in custody secure their early removal from our high than in the previous month we have just announce court sitting day which be the high level for very long time to answer the right hon gentleman specific question we will exclude anyone serve more than four year in prison all those convict of terrorist or national security crime and those who be subject to high level of risk management by multiple agency where the police and the prison and probation service work together which include certain sexual and violent offender include many domestic abuser if there be ongoing concern about the risk pose by an offender who be due to be release after the day period frontline worker can apply additional licence condition to manage that if further information relate to an offender risk be receive after they have be recall mean that they be no long consider suitable for fix term recall they may be detain for long on standard recall if that be assess as necessary by the hmpps public protection team we know how important it be that victim be keep inform all those eligible for the victim contact scheme will be notify about an offender release and will have the opportunity to make representation about victim relate licence condition although there be certain exclusion for serious offender change recall for fix term offender be necessary it would be even bad to run out of space which at this stage would mean the manage breakdown of the criminal justice system the lord chancellor say rightly that that would be unconscionable no government should leave that challenge as legacy to their successor as the right hon gentleman government do call the chair of the justice committee we should never forget that the crisis in our prison that the current lord chancellor be seek to resolve be create over year by the irresponsible mismanagement of the previous government although today announcement make sense in the short term subject to safeguard we must consider the whole way in which recall have develop from case year ago to more than today over of the prison population with less than of recall be for further offence will the government consider the way in which recall operate without the freeing up of space in prison rehabilitation be impossible overcrowd reach ridiculous level and we run out of space altogether my hon friend be right the recall population have double in just seven year and we need to address that the independent sentencing review will report shortly and hope that there will be recommendation to which we can respond in that report call the liberal democrat spokesperson there be no doubt that the conservatives plunge our prison into crisis interruption they chunter from sedentary position but what else would they call it it be clear that the government have fail to step up and tackle the sheer scale of the problem across the country victim and survivor be worried about what this will mean for they if there be specific domestic abuse offence dangerous offender could be exclude from early release but the government have take no action at all since the liberal democrats raise that solution with they last autumn will the minister finally commit to give victim and survivor the protection that they deserve by create new domestic abuse aggravate offence and will he go far to protect our community by introduce clear plan to reduce reoffende which be the only way to solve prison crowding once and for all if the minister will not listen to will he listen to the domestic abuse commissioner who have just warn that life be now at risk the hon member will know that his colleague the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller be work closely with the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones on get thing right for victim that be something we take very seriously and it need to be do properly with victim in order to get it right hope that the independent sentencing review report will contain thing that give we confidence about move forward and about the way we work with victim the conservatives appear to have forget quite number of thing and think it might be good time to remind they former justice secretary chris grayling disastrous partial privatisation of the probation service be overturn in after the number of serious offence include rape and murder commit by those on probation skyrocket do the minister agree that we be see the long tail of conservative failure which overshadow everything that we must do now my hon friend be right to remind the house of the chaos and turmoil that the conservatives apply to our very important probation service when they be in government we be put probation back together we have already bring new probation officer on board and we be commit to further in the come year mr speaker to pick up on your statement for which think the whole house will be grateful be sure that my committee will take up your clear urge for we to look at the issue with regard to the ministerial code know the minister will agree that domestic abuse can not be an issue to which lip service be pay in this house and then policy seem to neglect make no apology for return to the view of the domestic abuse commissioner for england and wales who issue severe warning to the lord chancellor yesterday comment can not stress the lack of consideration for victim safety and how many life be be put in danger because of this propose change why do the minister think the commissioner with all her expertise and knowledge have arrive at that conclusion we have great respect for the victims commissioner what would be let down victim be if we allow the prison system to get to place where we can not lock prisoner up that would be unconscionable that be why it be important that we have take these step remind the hon member that we be exclude those prisoner who pose the most risk and be manage under mappa multi agency public protection arrangement level and that mean various agency work together the exclusion also include all those convict of terrorist and national security crime proper action can be take where agency identify risk to move from fix term recall to standard recall will the minister tell whether be correct that when we enter office there be few than space leave in our prison terrible failure from the conservative party do he agree that instead of empty word and false promise to build prison this government be get on with the job my hon friend be quite right we face real emergency when we come into office it be unconscionable that any government would do that to an incoming government the previous labour government add prison place in year in their year the conservative government manage to add in month we have already deliver prison place have the ministry of justice conduct an impact assessment for this policy if so will it release that to the house as soon as possible if not can the lord chancellor confirm how she know what impact the policy will have on victim and the wide public we be always alert to the need to assess how policy apply to the wide public and victim that be important this situation be one of the most egregious example of state failure and consequence of the bad chaos and incompetence of the last year the lord chancellor have be clear that give current level of demand we can not build our way out of this crisis do the minister agree that we have to be honest and do something different to ensure that we never again run out of prison place include improve the exist prison estate and invest in the probation service so that we can reduce reoffende and thereby reduce the pressure on prison place we be improve the prison estate and invest in probation and there will also be action come forward from the independent sentencing review agree with everything my hon friend say victim of domestic abuse sexual abuse and stalking be now in fear particularly those who live in rural area where tagging do not always work what particular measure will the minister put in place to support victim in rural area who be distant from probation officer and the police anybody subject to fix term recall will be recall for day and if their risk be assess as great they will be transfer to standard recall the reality be that anybody affect by this have already serve their time in prison they be on licence be properly monitor and effectively manage by the probation service the prison capacity crisis have be year in the making do the minister welcome the news that wayland prison in norfolk have be grant planning permission just this week by breckland council planning committee for increase in capacity with extra place that application alone represent of the total place create under the last government in year do he agree that this be further evidence of the government deliver after year of inaction my hon friend be exactly right to point to that planning application go forward it be excellent news and show that we be crack on with the job although the government should have volunteer to defend their position accept have hold ministerial responsibility for the prison estate that they have no good option at this point do the minister accept that the problem with what he be choose to do be that the return to prison for breach of important licence condition be there to be deterrent and if we reduce that deterrent we run the risk of more people breach licence condition which would make the overcrowding problem bad if he choose that path will he consider increase the deterrent effect by ensure that follow day return to prison there be other restriction on prisoner freedom such as electronic tagging certainly hope that all those thing will be look at by the independent sentencing review the mandating of the day fix term release be measure take by the previous government we be extend that to day for sentence of up to four year because of the situation that we face to ensure that we do not run out of prison place in the interim like many resident across filton and bradly stoke be rightly appal last summer to discover the real situation leave behind by the conservative party when it come to prison do the minister agree that this be an opportunity for the conservative party to apologise my hon friend make good point and the house will have hear it the minister and the secretary of state have often use the word emergency to describe the state of the prison population and have ask the secretary of state how long it will take to deport all the foreign criminal clog up our jail this be moment for the secretary of state to say yes this be an emergency and to deport the lot of they free up about place which would help overcome this crisis we have deport more foreign national offender in month than the last government do in the previous month and we be continue to work hard with the home office to deport foreign national offender we will never be able to do that on the scale necessary to address the challenge that we face in our prison at this time on recent visit to featherstone prison near wolverhampton come across several prisoner who have be recall and who be wait up to year to have their case progress do the minister agree that limit the recall sentence make great use of technology to punish offender in the community and make the probation service more effective will result in well rehabilitation of prisoner reduce reoffende and ease the prison overcrowding cause by the previous government my hon friend point out the action that we must take to address the challenge that we face in the system and to make the system work well for victim and protect the public many domestic abuser will give their nature welcome the opportunity to give another twist of the knife at the cost of mere day have the minister just present they with practical opportunity have carefully go through the exclusion from this measure and emphasise the importance of good professional body continue to apply proper risk assessment when risk assessment say that standard recall be more appropriate than fix term recall that will happen it be bit rich for conservative members to be critical when they leave the criminal justice system in total meltdown do my hon friend agree that tagging be an important resource for protect the public from criminal perhaps he see the channel programme dispatches which show that the contract give to serco by the conservative party be totally and utterly fail do he have confidence in serco to deliver that contract and if not will he remove it and bring that service back under public control it be clear that tag technology have huge potential recent study have show reduction in reoffende by offender wear curfew tag but my hon friend be right to draw attention to concern about the contract serco performance be improve but it be still not acceptable the reporting in the dispatches programme be from last year when we know that there be serious issue and we issue financial penalty to serco which be give the contract by the previous government if serco performance drop again all option will remain on the table this announcement be further illustration of why this house should legislate to remove all impediment to the deportation of foreign national offender in his reply to the shadow justice secretary the minister say that victim who be affect by this policy should be keep inform about release yet he refuse to say whether the department have conduct an impact assessment what new information be he today willing to commit to publishing each month so that victim be indeed keep inform victim absolutely need to be keep inform and we continue to work with victim group and the victims commissioner to ensure that they be in separate case two family in my constituency lose love one when they be murder by offender who be out on remand but should never have be will the minister meet and if they wish both family so that they can have some assurance that lesson have be learn from these case and so that other family be not place in the same horrendous situation be very sorry to hear about the case mention by my hon friend be happy to meet he to take the matter far the victims commissioner have warn that free prisoner early who have be show to pose reoffende risk to the public will place victim and the wide public at an unnecessary risk of harm the domestic abuse commissioner have say that it be simply unacceptable what discussion do the government have with those two commissioner before make the announcement we speak to the victims commissioner regularly the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones be speak to they later today the justice secretary could have choose to deport more of the thousand of offender in our jail maxe out court sitting day repurposed building or procure temporary facility to hold offender why have she instead choose to release serious offender include domestic abuser from jail early with no consideration for the victim this be not about release people from prison early yes it be no it be not this be about people who have already serve their sentence in prison they be out in the community if they breach condition of their licence they be return to prison the hon gentleman might as well ask why the government he support do not take any of the measure that he mention our government inherit the mess that his government leave we and we be take decision to address the unconscionable threat of have prison system that be not able to lock up dangerous people minister seem to have be deliberately vague about the number of domestic abuse offender who will be eligible for release and the breadth of their offence give how big the announcement be the government and the department will have do lot of work look at who will be eligible will the minister set out to the house the exact number of domestic abuse offender who will be eligible for this scheme hear the right hon gentleman question and will write to he the first duty of government be to keep the public safe recently meet constituent whose convict ex husband be serve prison sentence have rap she twice despite be in prison he continue to have indirect access to their child my constituent think that be wrong and agree do the minister agree that convict violent and sexual offender should serve maximum possible custodial sentence and lose parental access right the hon gentleman will be aware that the victims and courts bill be about to go through parliament and that be the sort of issue that we will look at during the bill passage one of the reason why our prison be so full be that we have more than foreign national in they what step be the minister take to deport they say gently that we have deport more foreign national in the first year on our watch than the previous government do in the year on their watch he be right that we have to roll up our sleeve and continue to get on with the job the minister have be slightly equivocal in answer this question which have ask on two previous occasion third time lucky prior to announce this policy change yesterday do the government meet and consult the domestic abuse commissioner about it yes or no the commissioner have be speak to by the team to be clear the impact assessment will be publish when we come to consider the statutory instrument the new measure announce by the justice secretary suggest that the government have learn nothing from the furore and loss of public confidence that follow last year early release debacle that same justice secretary along with the victims minister the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones who be in her place sign the protest letter that lead to the convict child rapist fabian henry be remove from deportation flight the prime minister sign that letter too why do the justice secretary and her ministers appear to have such scant regard for the impact that their management of prison release will have on the victim of crime when will she implement measure that act as deterrent to recidivism rather than as minor inconvenience to the continuation of criminal career we be committed to get this right the early release scheme that the previous government put in place do not have the same exception as our early release scheme do for the sort of offender that the hon gentleman draw attention to but these matter be very difficult the most important thing be ensure that we have criminal justice system that work we need to be able to lock up dangerous people and those who do really bad thing when we come into government the situation be that we might not be able to maintain that ability we have have to take action that we would far rather not take in order to keep the system go the minister be very decent person and he and have be friend for many year but must ask this question which hope can put in the way that wish to really struggle to understand the rationale behind allow criminal to consider their option and work out whether what they intend to do be worth an additional day in jail or allow person to weigh up whether break restraining or non molestation order be worth month in prison criminal need to fear that if they break the law again it will be bad for they how do the minister and the department think that the policy will disincentivise repeat offend have make clear the exception that apply to this tight fix term recall alteration the management of people in the community will be risk assess as always if the view be that different approach need to be take it will be take royal assent have to notify the house in accordance with

about he if she wish more widely we have have week of mixed economic with growth slightly up weak wage growth spike in unemployment as everyone have predict in the case of national insurance and fiscal strain highlight just today by former treasury civil servant we have also have an immigration policy launch with echo of enoch powell and prime minister who appear not to know the difference between capital and current spending in relation to hospice that be seek to support people day to day across this country people who be literally at death door would have move on from the politic of the week at this point in my remark but for the extraordinary series of intervention by mr speaker only few minute ago on the government failure to announce their policy in the house mr speaker rightly seek and be eventually give an apology by the minister the hon member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin for their late failure but the irony be absolutely extraordinary that announcement come just hour after the leader of the house have to be drag to this chamber to answer question on this very topic she fail to apologise to this house yesterday wonder whether she will take the opportunity to do so today whether she do or not hope that you madam deputy speaker as well as mr speaker and all the deputy speakers will insist on maintain the primacy of our parliamentary democracy and demand that government be hold to account today come to the chamber not to ask about particular item of policy but to offer positive policy idea not to focus on what may be pass from day to day in the government policy but to focus on the long term and to celebrate do so in relation to personal interest of mine indeed mini obsession as the house probably know which be growth development and innovation in high education this week we see the graduation of the first student at our new university in hereford the new model institute for technology and engineering it be the first greenfield university in this country for year specialist technical engineering university teaching student of every age and background especially those from less well off family in very intensive and immersive way it teach they the hand on skill of an apprenticeship but also the rigour of master degree its student work in team build work habit and work closely with partner company in defence security energy construction food and agriculture mention that university now because it highlight what could be consider lack of ambition in the way that we as country have think about high education over the past year or possibly even long nmite be an institution that be not just focus on marginal educational gain but on transformational improvement it aim to take person male or female young or old who might never have think of go to university at all and help they to find their passion head hand and heart and take they as far as they can go it aim to reinvent not just what student learn but how they learn with theory and practice tie together in real world challenge forge professional through immersive and intensive work with sense of mission and purpose it aim to build the right habit and prepare those student not just for the world of work but for world of work that be constantly change above all the university seek to keep the benefit of be small in size something we have lose in so much of high education with agility accountability personal engagement teamwork and friendship and sense of belong and community so that our student grow as morally serious human being who can readily and resiliently deal with complexity and uncertainty and who be deeply aware of the power and responsibility that come with be an engineer do it work these student be study for master in engineering certify independently as be of very high quality the first cohort be go into job at rate of almost in company such as balfour beatty kier cadbury bae awe safran and local company at an average salary of draw national need and local need together it be the small modular reactor of british high education raise this example because want to invite the government and members from across the house to consider whether we could not do it elsewhere there be at least small city and large town in this country that lack high education and high economic growth there be huge need for specialist science technology engineering and mathematic skill we have vast amount of talent deprive of opportunity and this can be part of the solution do not know whether any colleague would like to be involve but each could be in their own area and their constituency lead on the creation not just of campus but of new university design for local people local business and national economic opportunity that be the opportunity invite the house and the government to consider it will take this opportunity to also pay tribute to sir roy stone the former principal private secretary to the government chief whip he be very much know as the usual channel and think he embody that with distinction do not know he personally but know of his reputation and of the love and esteem in which he be hold by many member across the house we send our thought to his family and friend again at this time the thought of many across the house will also be with those live in gaza we see the intolerable suffering death and starvation on our screen most evening and it must stop now food be not reach starve people airstrike be kill civilian and hostage be still be hold know that this whole house want to see change of course meaningful aid get in an urgent ceasefire and path to durable peace also hear mr speaker statement this morning about the government give statement to this house in timely fashion and absolutely hear what he say as say yesterday in the house will ensure that that message be relay as do on many occasion to our cabinet colleague just remind the house that the lord chancellor lay long write ministerial statement yesterday afternoon as do the home secretary early in the week but we can and we must do well the right hon gentleman as say yesterday in the house should remember that we have give oral statement in just sitting day and that far outstrip what happen under his government when frankly they disrespect parliament time after time will not be take any lecture from he on that hear what the right hon gentleman say about the new technical university in his constituency in herefordshire it sound like an important and good innovation to provide technical education and engineering pathway particularly for people from certain background who might not otherwise access such education my eld son be currently study engineering at one of the university that represent manchester metropolitan university and hope he and many other have pathway into work the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that when high education join much more closely with the place of work and the skill that be need for the job of the future that be when we get much more bang for our buck and our young people have the opportunity in life that they need notice that the right hon gentleman do just about mention the economy again this week he do not seem to want to welcome the good news on growth figure out this morning and he do not mention the interest rate cut last week either nor do he mention the job that we have create since the election do not know if he notice what the former chancellor george osborne say last week about the stance of the conservatives under their current leader that they be more interested in culture war than in have serious economic plan he be right be he the right hon gentleman talk about get figure wrong but what way for the leader of the opposition to get her figure wrong during prime minister question yesterday by factor of do not know if the right hon gentleman want to set the record straight on that she also do not seem to grasp the importance and value of the trade deal that we have strike in the last week or so and of the billion of pound that they will bring into the economy thankfully though there be still few true conservative on the back benches who really understand the core conservative idea of free trade his former deputy prime minister the right hon member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden welcome those trade deal his former brexit secretary the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay welcome they too even kwasi kwarteng the former chancellor say that the us uk deal be success

role do otsi play in any change the minister refer to robust action to increase sanction evasion deterrence but what specific measure be be consider he also mention new enforcement strategy when can we expect that to be publish would welcome clarity on how the new joint sanction intelligence function fit into our exist intelligence framework how do he envisage that work with what we be do with the us and our other five eyes partner as be sure the minister appreciate thank to our leave the european union we now have our own sanction framework the flexibility to set our own framework and lead the charge with ally and partner can not be squander do the minister expect the eu security pact to touch on the independence of our sanction regime we should look to build on the strong measure that we have place on country and entity what progress be be make in identify further sanction to impose on those already target will the minister give we an assessment of the number of group and militia operate in syria how will he ensure that the relaxation in sanction benefit the people of syria how often will he review the impact of the relaxation of sanction will he commit to put sanction on

the critical mass of the current uk sanction on iran be introduce under the last conservative government sanction form one part of the approach to tackle iran but what be the minister broad strategy on iran when we be in government we impose the large and most severe set of sanction that russia have ever see the economic pressure that we have collectively impose with the international community have cripple the russian economy and deprive putin of billion that could have fund his illegal war we can not afford to let up on exert that pressure on putin war machine part of that include tackle russian asset what consideration have the minister give to deploy asset from the sale of chelsea football club to support ukraine will he confirm timeframe for deploy that money would welcome clarity on what information be come forward to the minister about potential sanction breach and loophole that be be exploit do the review sufficiently plug the gap that have be identify will he update we on what action he be take against any third party country that be support the country and entity we have already sanction finally how do the minister plan to deepen our international co ordination what discussion have the government have with the united states do the government have advance knowledge of yesterday announcement will it have bearing on uk policy on sanction on syria sanction be crucial tool in our diplomatic arsenal we must ensure that they operate as effectively as possible to ensure that international norm be adhere to thank the shadow minister for her broad welcome for this work will do my good to answer as many of her question as can the shadow minister ask about the overall review as say it be be publish now and she can peruse that when she can encourage other hon member to look at that as well we welcome feedback and suggestion on it to summarise couple of the key theme we recognise that different sector be at different level of maturity with sanction and that government communication and engagement need to reflect that some area need more assistance there be lot of will but they need support some of the measure can be very technical and we want to ensure that business can comply direct engagement between government and industry be important as that have the high impact on compliance we need to bring together our effort so that they be understand range of different agency be do important and distinct work but that need to be understand by the layperson we need to improve our guidance and ensure we bridge any gap in unclear regulation we need to ensure that people understand the consequence of breach sanction as well as the option if they voluntarily disclose measure as number of business and other have do there be way forward the shadow minister ask about intelligence and co operation with other country which be crucial we will explore how that intelligence function work but can assure she that there be already huge amount of co operation between we and key partner include in the united states the eu and elsewhere cross government co operation be also important our official work incredibly hard and pay tribute to the incredible team in the sanction unit at the foreign commonwealth and development office and in other departments because they do remarkable work the shadow minister ask specifically about co operation with the eu it be important that we co operate with the eu on sanction as we do already that be be consider along with range of measure as we approach the important summit next week assure she that our sanction policy remain our own but we can often have maximum effect when we work in co ordination with other the eu be progress its own package against russia and other on third country circumvention have pay particular attention to that issue indeed have meeting just this morning to raise concern on that specific issue with partner country such meeting be feature of pretty much every week and we be bear down on all the route that might support measure that undermine our sanction on the sale of chelsea football club we be determined to see the proceed reach humanitarian cause in ukraine as soon as possible and we be do everything we can to bring that about quickly but this be complex legal issue the uk be work with international partner have engage with abramovich team and be explore all option to ensure that the proceed reach vulnerable people in ukraine who be most in need on syria the shadow minister know that we update the regime this week and we remain with those sanction against the assad regime but we have remove restriction on other we reserve the right to introduce new sanction in future circumstance on any regime but we will keep the situation there under close review and respond to the change circumstance we will judge the new government by their action on iran we announce on april further sanction to tackle the domestic threat pose by the iranian regime by sanction the iranian back sweden base foxtrot criminal network and its leader rawa majid for their role in attack against target across europe we take very firm action in relation to the supply of ballistic missile to russia for use in the illegal war in ukraine we remain determined that iran must never develop nuclear weapon and we be commit to use all tool available to ensure that include use the un sanction snapback mechanism if necessary lastly the shadow minister ask about enforcement how we be have an impact and what difference be be make have already give some example but another example be that in april the national crime agency secure the first criminal conviction for the breach of russian sanction dmitry ovsyannikov be find guilty of circumvent sanction regulation and money laundering after receive from his wife and new mercedes from his brother who be also find guilty of circumvent sanction regulation they be sentence to month imprisonment and month imprisonment suspend for month respectively so the right hon lady can be absolutely assure that all the appropriate authority be act these investigation be often complex and necessarily be not make public urge the house to bear with some of our excellent team in different agency as they seek to enforce on these regime call the chair of the foreign affairs committee the minister already know my view that as we develop our sanction policy parliament should be more engaged so that we can have collective knowledge and all feed in to the good possible sanction policy we do not have enough of that at the moment and there be more that we should do one thing that member would do be suggest more creative way of use sanction and more lateral thinking but in the end it do not matter how creative or eye catch sanction be if it be not enforce it mean nothing my concern and the concern of many be that there be simply not enough investigation be do for breach of sanction particularly against british company have listen very carefully to the rapid way in which the minister give his statement and read carefully what be in it but nothing in it say that more resource will be put into actually investigate potential breach of sanction we can change rule and give more power but if there be not enough people actually kick down door literally or otherwise to ensure that company be not breach sanction we be frankly waste fantastic opportunity my right hon friend be no stranger to these issue and it have be pleasure to engage with she on they in my conversation with she welcome the work of her committee in that regard gently say that there have be significant amount of parliamentary scrutiny of sanction include two occasion this week already as the shadow minister mention as well as the course of our debate fcdo oral question and my statement today but be absolutely committed to engage with parliamentarian we have hold number of roundtable and hope to continue to do those on regular basis we welcome all advice and information from parliamentarian it be often not possible to come back to the house particularly on specific information and suggestion my right hon friend will understand the importance of our not comment on possible future designation because do so would lessen their impact my right hon friend rightly raise the challenge of the actual resource for enforcement they be across range of agency and departments and be subject to ongoing discussion in the spending review but have witness the work of number of those organisation can assure she that they be do some absolutely incredible work will give another example in march the office of financial sanction implementation announce the imposition of civil monetary penalty of against hsf moscow for breach uk sanction and publicise the lesson that industry can learn from that case there be example after example and want to see more of they will continue to work with our enforcement agency and other to ensure that be the case call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of his statement welcome the cross party consensus we have hear today that an effective sanction regime be one of the most potent tool at our disposal to promote the uk ideal and interest abroad it have form vital pillar in the strategy to punish putin and undermine his ability to prosecute the war in ukraine however our sanction regime must be coherent and consistently apply to be effective know that the minister be personally committed to that and welcome today report yet the disparate responsibility across department and agency have sometimes work against the effectiveness of our approach despite the hard work of official to which the minister have already refer what lesson can the minister point to from the review that will ensure that future development and application of our sanction policy will be truly join up across the many agency in government follow president trump meeting yesterday with president al sharaa our approach to sanction in syria be critical test of that approach can the minister confirm that the government will consider lift further sanction on syria only if sanction relief be precede by clear progress towards political inclusion and the protection of minority group and woman in syria the minister know that the liberal democrats have repeatedly urge the government to use sanction more robustly against the leader of country that have take action against british value or in violation of international law may therefore urge he to use the impetus from the review to take fresh look at three case will he and official urgently review the application of sanction on supporter of the georgian dream party include bidzina ivanishvili and irakli kobakhidze who be work to suppress democracy in georgia will they review that for official in hong kong who have lead the suppression of democracy in the city and the extraterritorial intimidation of democracy campaigner resident in the uk will they also review that for the extremist member of the israeli cabinet ben gvir and smotrich who continue to advocate for the conquest of gaza and the forced displacement of palestinians from the occupy territory thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for his broad support for the thrust of these measure and agree with many of the point he make he specifically ask about syria we have an extensive discussion about this early this week but be absolutely clear that the sanction on those individual responsible for atrocity under the assad regime remain in place the change that we have make be relate to ensure that financial and economic activity in line with the potential for peace and stability in syria be able to emerge but assure he that we keep the situation under very close review and retain the ability to impose further sanction and other measure at future point he make point about an inclusive political settlement and the absence of violence we have see some very worrying incident in recent month and we will watch very carefully and closely along with other partner and co ordinate with other on that the hon gentleman also raise three specific context he know that will not comment on future designation but we always welcome input and note what he say in relation to georgia we have sanction multiple individual responsible in relation to the repressive action and corruption that we have see in recent month and we keep the situation under close review be deeply concerned about the situation in georgia have make that clear to georgian dream representative and will make it absolutely clear again our team be work very closely and the hon gentleman know that we have suspend wide co operation with georgia that be deep regret because we have significant and positive relation with it but as long as it turn away from the euro atlantic path there must be consequence as well as consequence for the action it have take domestically and otherwise note what he have say but as he will understand will not comment on future designation the minister be do important work on sanction that be highly relevant to the situation in the middle east where israel aid blockade mean that large number of child in gaza will begin die of starvation in the come day it plan to dismantle the humanitarian system and replace aid worker with mercenary the israeli government be threaten the ethnic cleansing of palestinians and call up the military to make it happen while british diplomat at the un warn of genocide this house can not say never again to atrocity unless it act when face with they do the minister agree that the uk must uphold the responsibility to protect and that concrete action include fresh sanction on israeli ministers be need to stop israel in its track let aid in get hostage out and force an urgent ceasefire my hon friend speak with typical passion and from her experience of these matter she will know that we do not comment on potential future sanction but as the foreign secretary say in parliament on april we continue to keep all these issue under review the culture of impunity for those engage in violence be intolerable and the foreign secretary have also be clear with israeli ministers that the israeli government must clamp down on settler violence and settlement expansion my hon friend will know the sanction we have impose in that regard she will also know the action we have take against hamas and palestinian islamic jihad and the designation that have be introduce and that we have repeatedly call for an immediate ceasefire we have restore funding to the united nations relief and works agency suspend number of our export licence and provide million in humanitarian assistance and we continue to work at every level to bring an end to the horrific violence we be see and the intolerable death toll we will continue to work with all of our partner globally to achieve that do the minister agree that now it be slowly dawn on president trump that his friend vladimir be string he along there be good prospect that america will not weaken the level of sanction it impose on russia can he also clarify one point he say in his statement and also yesterday evening that if putin do not engage seriously with peace the uk and our ally will have no choice but to ramp up the economic pressure even far force he to the table would have think that we ought to be ramp up the economic pressure now to the maximum level that we can so unless the minister be just say that that ramp up will take long can suggest that the government get on with it as quickly as possible the right hon gentleman will know that we have be ramp up that pressure indeed the new measure we take just last night on support to russia and its military industrial complex do exactly that let alone the huge package of designation we have introduce against the shadow fleet again on the topic of enforcement during its first six month of operation from october last year to april this year the uk voluntary insurance reporting mechanism have challenge suspect shadow fleet vessel in the english channel on their insurance not only be we put these measure in place but we be follow up on they we have be very clear that president zelensky be serious about peace he have repeatedly show that by his action vladimir putin have not we be clear that our sanction will remain in place and we will continue to do all we can to choke off support for the russian war machine which be cause such devastation in ukraine give that sanction provide crucial leverage and deprive individual and regime of power and resource it be vital that they be apply equally when we see the effect that sanction have have on putin russia we question why the government have not bring equality against the israeli regime whose treatment of the palestinians be push people into starvation and famine and ultimately bring million people to their death in light of israel action we need equality and while understand that the minister will not make pronouncement from the dispatch box today could he set out how he formulate the evidence by which the threshold be reach for sanction to be apply will he look again at those framework to ensure that there be equality so that we can use sanction effectively and the world understand where this country be come from my hon friend ask about the broad principle that underlie our sanction action essentially there be three part the first be to deter malign activity the second be to disrupt malign activity and the third be to demonstrate value as reference we have impose sanction in relation to extreme settler violence and we have work with other partner on range of measure she will understand that be not go to comment on future designation as say moment ago but we remain deeply seized of the situation in gaza at present the minister for the middle east my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer as well as the foreign secretary and other be deeply engage with this issue and have set out number of the step we have take to respond to it my hon friend can be assure that we act around the world through our sanction regime and have give number of example not just geographic area but in relation to theme have mention the theme of tackle illicit finance and kleptocracy more widely we have introduce number of measure in that regard so she can be assure that this be not simply about russia and ukraine sanction but about act globally the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry and do not agree on many issue but she be absolutely right to focus on enforcement before come to this place be head of sanction and anti money laundering at financial institution so with respect find it bit naive for the minister to say in his statement that avoid sanction do not pay these be often very profitable account he also reference the issue of compliance in his statement but institution often say that they be comply by file suspicious activity report safe in the knowledge that insufficient action will be take appreciate that the stock answer be we do not comment on individual enforcement case but could the minister tell we the average cost of successful prosecution for sanction breach and how many there have be since the government come to office the right hon gentleman know the industry and these measure of course he also hold senior role in government that be responsible for these matter so he will understand that be not go to go into the technical detail of every individual case however can tell he that for example his majesty revenue and customs have issue six compound settlement since against uk company that have breach the russia trade sanction for total of those include compound settlement in august for million so feel absolutely justified in say that avoid sanction do not pay and be committed to ensure that we have more of these action in future some of they will be public while other will not be range of measure be in place we be introduce new power particularly to find way of settle case in which company have come forward and voluntarily disclose but equally so that those that do not do so will face penalty too often sanction evasion happen via our british overseas territory particularly through secretive haven such as the british virgin islands and lack of public ownership record complicate effort to find out who be involve in sidestep our sanction regime with that in mind can the minister set out how he be work with all of the overseas territory to finally meet their commitment to introduce register of beneficial ownership and can he reassure this place that our sanction be robustly enforce across the entire uk family my hon friend be absolutely right to raise this issue which have repeatedly raise with the leader of the overseas territory and indeed with the crown dependency we have see robust action on sanction both in implement sanction and work with our authority to ensure that we have the big enforcement effect have mention the recent meeting we have at lancaster house with sanction enforcement official as well as the specific example of bvi the national crime agency have be work with the british virgin islands on range of issue and that work have be very productive but my hon friend be absolutely right that transparency contribute to effective sanction have repeat my expectation that ot and cd should introduce fully accessible public register of beneficial ownership but the ot also agree at last year joint ministerial council to introduce legitimate interest access register we have see real progress from number of they although some other be not quite there yet my hon friend can be assure that be not rest in raise serious concern about this issue and will continue to do so over the week ahead call richard foord member of the select committee the oil price cap prevent we from sell shipping and insurance service to company carry russian oil when it be sell above per barrel appreciate that the minister might say that he can not preannounce future sanction think we all understand that but have the uk advocate with ally for reduce that price cap far give that in recent week the price of crude oil have drop below per barrel the hon gentleman raise very important issue will not comment on future action but since the introduction of the oil price cap datum from the russian ministry of finance show reduction in tax revenue from oil in compare with the year before the price it have receive for flagship urals grade crude have continue to sit below global level and our work particularly on the shadow fleet have significantly disrupt and impact the revenue that putin be able to get from oil to fuel his war in ukraine we will consider all possible lawful measure to far strengthen our effort in that regard but the good way to do so be by work with our international partner we be engage in daily conversation on these matter but of course will not comment on future specific action thank my hon friend for his statement will he commit to investigate whether further sanction be require on regional federal military and legal enforcement agency that have be involve in and make possible the continued mass abduction and deportation of ukrainian child to russia at the very least will he commit to ensure that the uk align its sanction against individual involve in this forcible transfer of child with those impose by the united states and the european union my hon friend raise crucial point and she know of my personal support and indeed that of the foreign secretary on this important issue she know that we have already designate individual in this regard we continue to keep all future sanction possibility under review we will look closely at example of anybody involve in that heinous action of take ukrainian child away from their family and attempt to wipe out their culture and identity as the sanction regime ramp up although perhaps not as quickly as my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis call for endorse that call the minister be right to be do the work he be do as part of his review and assessment as those sanction ramp up and become more complicated do he feel that everything possible be be do to ensure that uk base business be keep up to date with that change picture so that no one inadvertently fall on the wrong side of the law the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise that issue the vast majority of uk business and individual want to comply with these regime they support they and they certainly do not want to be expose themselves or their customer to any additional risk we want to make sure that they have the good advice in timely clear and understandable fashion that be exactly what some of the measure in this review be set out to do they consolidate information and how it be provide and ensure that there be training and capacity building in sector that be perhaps less used to enforce in these area he can be assure that that be very much at the heart of what we be do because we want to help people to comply my hon friend make powerful case for the efficacy of sanction in achieve our diplomatic and foreign policy aim but as we observe the death the countless injury the forced displacement and now the possibility of mass starvation and the renewal of bombing of hospital by israel in gaza be it not time that sanction be apply to ministers such as smotrich and ben gvir it be perfectly understandable for the minister to say that he will not discuss future designation in the chamber but will he consider and discuss with colleague the strength of feeling in this chamber that sanction must be place on these individual soon rather than later my hon friend raise important and serious issue she know that we have repeatedly condemn the extreme rhetoric of far right israeli ministers we have take action against violent settler group in the west bank we be regularly support the humanitarian response in gaza whether that be through the million of humanitarian assistance the medical treatment and food the work we have do with jordan to fly medicine in or the work with egypt to treat medically evacuate civilian and with kuwait to support unicef there be range of measure but she will understand that will not comment on future designation the uk rightly have impose sanction on russia for its illegal invasion of ukraine and on putin for war crime the uk have impose sanction on official in syria for breach of international humanitarian law for target hospital school and aid convoy and for obstruct humanitarian aid as well as for the use of chemical weapon and the indiscriminate bombing of civilian how do the government therefore justify the absence of similar sanction on senior member of the israeli government when there be clear evidence of israel perpetrate the same violation what action have the uk government take to comply with their obligation specify in the international court of justice advisory opinion from july to withdraw all political economic and diplomatic support that help perpetuate israel unlawful occupation of palestine the hon gentleman raise number of question and it might be helpful if get the minister for the middle east my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer to respond to he directly on number of they we have repeatedly be clear as have just say in condemnation of the extreme rhetoric of far right israeli ministers we have be clear about the horrific situation that we see in gaza we have be clear about the support we be provide to make difference on the ground we have be clear in our support for ceasefire and clear in our call for immediate humanitarian access as have say repeatedly he will understand that do not comment on future designation can my hon friend update we on what conversation have be have about the use of frozen and sanction russian asset to support those fight russian aggression in ukraine that be an important question that have come up number of time this week my hon friend will know that we have already disburse the first two tranche under the extraordinary revenue acceleration scheme which be make tangible difference to ukraine right now we have put billion into the scheme and again thank colleague for ensure the swift passage of that measure we be resolute in that support we be continue to explore all other lawful option we be clear at least the majority of party in this house be that russia need to pay for the damage it have cause but the most impact will be feel if we can work with partner and in collaboration with other thank the minister for his answer and for return to the chamber within hour of his comment about russian sanction yesterday read an interesting article on financial sanction that highlight the alleged loophole that be enable sale and transfer of fund through estate agent property management and so on can the minister outline whether the department approach will also deal with those uk citizen who may be enable russian asset to be divert and therefore the circumvention of sanction which be right and proper the hon gentleman will know that there be significant civil and criminal penalty for the evasion of sanction if he or any other member of the house have any evidence of that hope that they would share that with we and the relevant authority and we be look at single reporting point for people to do that he can be assure that we look at every way in which people be try to circumvent the sanction regime we can not have london the uk or our british family be place for those who enable this type of activity we be resolute and commit to crack down on it welcome the minister statement it be fairly obvious that these sanction be essential in deter the kind of behaviour and activity that we do not want to see internationally the foreign secretary have speak about introduce sanction against those involve in smuggling gang and those who cause irregular migration to the uk the minister make reference to it in his statement too will he update the house on when we can expect to see such sanction take effect will he also comment on their effectiveness in deal with and defeat the criminal smuggling gang this government have be clear that we will take every measure possible to crack down on irregular migration and those who facilitate the cruel trade in human being traffic they across continent and country that be one of the reason we be introduce the new regime we will be bring forward the legislation in due course and at that time we will be able to discuss the exact detail of the proposal we aim to bring that forward as soon as possible so that we can start take action that be just one of the measure we be take and regularly engage with european and other partner to deal with the whole chain of smuggling gang and illegal migration that be exactly what the prime minister will be set out in his visit to albania the final question go to the ever patient chris vince thank the minister for his statement listen to comment from across the house be remind of conversation have this week with one of my constituent anne strike who be victim of polio she raise her concern about the recent case of polio find in conflict zone know how important resident of harlow see it to tackle breach of uk impose sanction the minister have touch on this bit already but will he tell what progress we have see on enforcement measure in recent month be delighted that the resident of harlow not only have my hon friend as an mp but be interested in see these measure be effect think that be share across the united kingdom people want to see these measure work have give number of example but will give he another the department for transport have detain four transport asset under the russian sanction regulation one helicopter two private jet and one super yacht total more than million hope the house can see today just how serious we our enforcement agency and all our departments be it be fantastic to be work in team across government on this issue again pay tribute to the fantastic official not only in the departments but in our enforcement agency they bring the pressure to bear on those who seek to evade or divert from our sanction regime safeguard vulnerable claimants work and pensions committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the work and pensions committee debbie abrahams will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not full speech hopefully people understand the difference between those two thing emphasise that question should be direct to the chair of the committee not the relevant government minister front benchers may take part in questioning thank the backbench business committee for allocate time for to make this statement to the house which mark the publication of the first report of this parliament safeguard vulnerable claimants the inquiry that lead to this report be first launch in by our predecessor committee under the stewardship of the former chair my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms who be now the minister for social security and disability pay tribute to he for both initiate and support the inquiry we be not able to conclude the inquiry before the general election last year so when be elect as chair of the work and pensions committee last september it be priority to bring it to conclusion be pleased that the new member of the committee agree and thank they for their support also thank the member of the previous committee who contribute to the thinking behind some of our recommendation want especially to thank the committee staff some of the unsung hero in this place from the previous committee thank danielle nash and particularly sarah dixon from the current committee thank john paul flaherty and especially alexandra ming also thank everyone who contribute to the report the many people and organisation who submit write and oral evidence and who take part in roundtable and survey finally wish to mention all the people who have not be treat or support as they should have be by the department for work and pensions ultimately this report be for they and try to ensure that other do not have to endure what they do the department for work and pensions be responsible for the delivery of essential service to million of people each year that include some of the most vulnerable people in society who rely on benefit or as prefer to call it social security support as their main source of income our predecessor committee open the inquiry on july primarily in response to concern that inadequate safeguarding practice in dwp have contribute to the death of claimant include through suicide and starvation first become aware of these appalling fact over year ago when the first work and pensions committee on which serve undertake an inquiry into sanction and the case of david clapson come to light david be veteran who die after be sanction which for the uninitiated mean that his financial support be stop he could not pay for power and the insulin in his fridge no long work the case keep come errol graham who have serious mental illness have his employment and support allowance incorrectly stop he starve to death and his emaciated body be find in his flat philippa day young mum with mental health issue who rely on the personal independence payment take her own life will never forget hear the recording of philippa phone dwp and plead for her money not to be stop there have also be the case of kevin gale michael alexander boamah faiza hassan ahmed emma day terence talbot nazerine anderson afolabi ojerinde richard ms abrahams would you like sip of water before you continue yes would be very grateful madam deputy speaker thank you not at all that be just the intervention that need there have also be the case of jodey whiting mark wood and many many other our report recognise the significance of every death and harm experience by claimant and the impact of these case on their love one we know that death and serious harm of claimant be investigate by the department in alone as part of its internal process review but in common with the national audit office report we believe that the actual number be much high we hear evidence that the process of access dwp support and some dwp policy themselves can create or exacerbate exist vulnerability for example sanction or the threat of sanction can lead to material deprivation stress and the deterioration of physical and mental health in some case the experience of engage with the system and the process have be so difficult and distressing that it have contribute to claimant decide to take their own life some of the most serious case of harm where coroner inquest have find that dwp contribute to claimant death have result in prevention of future death report since dwp have be issue with prevention of future death report relate specifically to the death of benefit claimant the fact that the equality and human rights commission issue section notice on the dwp for potential discrimination against disabled people in and the investigation that be subsequently launch last year after the failure to reach an agreement add to the evidence that the work and pensions committee collect on the dwp inadequate approach to safeguarding the inquiry set out to examine the support that the department provide to vulnerable claimant how it have learn from mistake and failure and what need to change the new committee agree to reopen the inquiry on october before turn to the finding and recommendation of the report should acknowledge that in the pathway to work green paper publish in march the government say they be consult on new dwp safeguarding approach to make it clear what the department and its staff be expect to do in order to safeguard the public welcome that and be hearten by the secretary of state evidence to the committee last november our principal recommendation be for statutory safeguarding duty to be place on the dwp to protect claimant although the secretary of state would be accountable for this duty reflect the leadership need to drive these change it would make safeguarding in the dwp everyone business at all level of the organisation and at all stage of policy development and implementation the duty would include the proactive consideration of the safeguarding need of claimant the ability to refer vulnerable individual to other agency with duty of care and again the proactive consideration of the impact of key policy and legislation on the health and wellbeing of claimant before they be implement the need for new legal obligation be clear the current approach to safeguarding in dwp have be describe as piecemeal and lack coherence and the committee agree for that reason the report call for comprehensive system base approach to safeguard that integrate into every stage of policy development implementation and review the approach must involve everyone in the dwp to ensure that safeguarding become fundamental part of the department culture we see new statutory duty as the cornerstone of big cultural shift that be need in the dwp for too long the focus have be on cost cutting often at the expense of provide genuine support that approach have lead to system in which claimant feel undeserving of support and fearful of the very department that be mean to assist they the necessary cultural shift must be drive from the top down with ministers and senior official lead the way statutory safeguarding duty would help to focus mind improve accountability and ensure that safeguarding become everybody business in the dwp the need for deep root cultural change in the department can not be overstate the process of engage with the dwp often lead to mental distress for claimant this distress be compound by lack of trust in the system drive by continual cost cut measure and an unhelpful media narrative to rebuild trust the dwp must prioritise safeguarding and support over cost cutting and this mean create system that not only help people to find sustainable work but compassionately support those who may never work the report also emphasise the importance of learn from past mistake the department have conduct number of ipr but the full scale of harm be much high the ongoing investigation by the equality and human rights commission into the department treatment of disabled people and those with long term mental health condition underscore the need for transparency and accountability in addition to the statutory duty the report make number of other important recommendation which will go through quickly as have mention it be recommend that all significant new policy be analyse by the department chief medical adviser team currently such assessment be not routinely carry out lead to policy that may inadvertently harm claimant or exacerbate exist vulnerability by make these assessment standard part of policy development we hope to ensure that the impact of policy on the health and wellbeing of claimant be consider and harm mitigate the report stress the importance of have robust clear and accessible complaint procedure to prevent failure recur as have state the true scale of death and harm be not know the report call for systematic recording and publication of all case of serious harm and death involve claimant the department should commit to publish this information annually to aid transparency the report also recommend improve transparency in the process use to learn from serious mistake and failure and the introduction of an independent body the department should not mark its own homework to investigate serious harm on define and identify vulnerability the department current approach be see as flexible lack in clarity and consistency the report call for formalise definition of vulnerability that be clearly communicate in public face document it also recommend add victim of abuse to the additional support area in universal credit and implement proactive measure to identify and support vulnerable claimant ensure that vulnerable people can access the benefit they be entitle to be crucial for deliver equitable welfare provision the removal of the help to claim face to face service have make it more difficult for some individual to apply for universal credit the report recommend that the dwp ensure that jobcentre provide thorough support and that detailed information about additional support be proactively offer to claimant in that regard do give praise because there be so many good people in the department such as the advanced customer support senior leader who be integral to help frontline dwp staff praise those staff and we need more of they effective communication and make sure that people be aware of what support they can access be also important and we need more of it that also apply to training and capacity building for frontline staff which need to happen to achieve the cultural change we need finally collaboration with other agency need to be statutory responsibility and there need to be dwp membership of the safeguarding adult board be very grateful to you madam deputy speaker first pay tribute to the work of my hon friend she have be persistent champion of safeguard vulnerable people in the system and this report really emphasise that be surprised that the committee do not recommend the removal of conditionality because that be serious lead into harm for so many people in anticipation of the pathway to work legislation come before this house think the report make very sobering reading and raise serious concern about safeguarding and the accountability of that safeguarding would pick out the recommendation about the chief medical adviser assessment currently that be private advice to ministers what step do my hon friend believe can be take so the house can be supply with the full evidence base it need to make informed choice not least because policy such as pathway to work will place many people at serious risk include serious risk to their life thank my hon friend for her question on the pathway to work green paper one of our recommendation be that any analysis undertake by the cma team should be publish and make available more generally we also ask that analysis of the impact of key policy and legislation on the health and wellbeing of claimant be consider beforehand and respond to appropriately do the hon lady believe that the safety of very vulnerable claimant would be improve if there be system within the dwp for flag they as vulnerable and ensure so far as it be practically possible that they always deal with the same person who might be specifically qualified to look after people with such vulnerability the right hon member make an excellent point there be some system but the inquiry find that they be very fragmented and little too ad hoc this be about make coherent case that this be everybody business yes we should be proactively identify and assess the vulnerability of claimant when they present and we should be able to signpost they to other agency that may for example have statutory duty of care this report be both important and timely and be proud to be member of the committee that have publish it today it be good to hear the minister recognise during the inquiry that the culture of the department need to change and that safeguarding must be at the heart of this duty to report safeguard concern be second nature to as teacher have clear understanding of the safeguarding duty expect of and rightly so the safeguarding of vulnerable adult be just as important so this need to be second nature to those at the dwp do my hon friend agree that we must see clear action from the government to create the more compassionate system that we need to make this reality be grateful to my hon friend and thank she for all that she have do since become member of the select committee wholeheartedly agree with everything she say and do hope that the government response come soon rather than later thank my hon friend for what be very distressing statement how might the plan for safeguard dwp claimant apply to current government policy thank my hon friend for that important question as say to my hon friend the member for york central rachael maskell this be really important the bedrock of the report be that safeguard need to be integrate into policy development at all stage and at all level of the organisation and before policy and legislation be implement so it be absolutely key to the legislation that be be consider and that will be go through the house thank my hon friend for her statement and it be pleasure to serve under her chairship on the select committee this report be sober reading and the evidence we take be often heartbreaking do she agree that over and above the report specific procedural recommendation the overarch theme from everything we hear be that there need to be cultural change in the department that will ensure reflective practice curiosity and sharing of good practice with culture drive by compassion for the most vulnerable people in our country be grateful to my hon friend who be my vice chair on the committee and thank she for all that she do the culture be one of the key thing and both the statutory duty and make sure we have system base approach to safeguarding be absolutely key will never forget quote from one of our witness who have live experience of use the system when she say she feel that system that be mean to wrap its arm around we be strangle we that just should not happen in this country and with such an important department know that the hon member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams take her work incredibly seriously and we could see the emotion when she deliver her statement backbench business solar farms beg to move that this house have consider solar farm must first inform the house that my husband be farmer and agricultural contractor be very grateful to the backbench business committee for allow time for debate on large scale solar farm there be some thing that member across the house can agree on we all want cheap and reliable energy we all want food security and affordable food price and we want to live sustainably and to protect our natural surrounding whether or not we agree on how we should achieve those goal think we can at least agree that these be desirable aim so why be the issue seemingly so controversial it be controversial because it be doubtful that large scale solar farm on prime agricultural land can achieve any of those aim first how good be solar panel in principle solar energy be green but the reality be murky the journey of solar panel from raw material to installation be far from carbon neutral the production process demand substantial energy often source from fossil fuel it require the mining of silver and zinc it require energy to produce the intense heat need to melt quartz for polysilicon and the transportation of component and finish panel across vast distance by diesel power truck train and ship what happen when the panel reach the end of their lifespan recycling should be the obvious answer yet they be notoriously difficult to recycle constituent of mine who dedicate their master research to this issue find that most solar panel once they finish their lifecycle can not currently be effectively recycle solar energy be not morally clean either most solar panel sell in the uk an astonishing material source from place where there be concern about force labour baroness may of maidenhead the former prime minister do so much to champion the cause of combat modern slavery during her tenure and we must not be complicit in human right abuse in business supply chain the government decision to turn yesterday on the lords message on the great british energy bill be welcome but it be shameful that it come only after so much pressure even if the challenge with production transportation and recycling could be resolve there be concern about whether solar energy be the right option for the uk energy production at all solar energy be most effective in sunny place where there be high demand for energy when it be sunny but in the uk the high energy demand occur when it be cold and dark that mean energy must be store lead to the need for large battery storage system which bring their own problem we would require another debate just to discuss those in fact the uk be rank as second to last on list of country in term of its suitability for photovoltaic electricity production there be further point about suitability my hon friend as lincolnshire mp will know that our county produce hugely disproportionate amount of the nation food compromise food production put food security at risk because the solar farm which be industrial development use up land that could otherwise feed the nation my right hon friend be of course right as usual and will address that point in more detail later in my speech even if we could resolve all those production recycling and transportation issue and so accept that solar be viable for the uk ground mount solar project be not the right approach panel instal so far be relatively inefficient despite currently instal capacity of gw the total output last year be less than of that our current approach be also centre around technology that be outdate if member can cast their mind back to when the first apple mac computer be put on the market and then look today at the present advance in technology they will see that technology have evolve at rapid pace solar panel plan for field today be already be supersede by clean more efficient technology that do not need farmland researcher in japan be develop next generation panel make from iodine they be flexible and time thin than exist panel they would make it realistic to build solar installation on urban infrastructure such as stadium airport and office building do the hon lady agree that solar energy generation be key step stone on our pathway towards green economy and to reach net zero for those of we in this house who still believe in it however where possible we should not take up agricultural land be very pleased to say that my office be support farmer dibble in my constituency who be seek to prevent solar panel be put over some acre of his farm we should instead shine little sunlight on the idea of put solar panel on the roof of all new building as suggest by my hon friend the member for cheltenham max wilkinson agree wholeheartedly that we should not use our good agricultural farmland for solar panel the previous government take step to establish million fund to incentivise rooftop installation on farm building that be the right measure to maximise the efficient use of land this government approach by contrast be to concentrate ground mount solar on prime agricultural land that be folly in the high degree there be acre of unused south face industrial rooftop across this country we should use those before we even consider industrialise our countryside industrialise it come with consequence will come back to farming in moment but first we should consider the impact on the wide community access to green space and exercise be good for wellbee imagine for moment walk your dog not alongside hedgerow but between two metre high metal fence with cctv camera on they how many of we would prefer to run past mile of metre high solar panel than roll british countryside listen carefully to my constituent and have conduct survey in the affected area have receive over handwritten response to my solar farm survey many of which contain page of heartfelt comment from people who be deeply worried about the disproportionate number of application for massive solar project in our area the beautiful village of stowe by chartley in my constituency will be almost ring by solar panel do my hon friend think that the planning inspectorate need to consider when make decision the cumulative impact of multiple development on community my right hon friend be right will come on to the cumulative effect later in my speech he will recall that the previous government bring in measure to ensure that happen but it do not seem to be happen in my survey of respondent be concern about the enormous scale of proposal and be concern about the use of productive farmland the scale of the propose development be really difficult to describe bring to the former prime minister my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak map with overlay of area with which he be familiar he see the problem and to his credit he take the action that have describe if the minister be prepared to meet would like to provide he with similar map so that he can see for himself the scale of these potential development the development go on for mile as my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson say they encircle village prevent natural growth and home building over time they even encircle individual home one isolate rural home in my constituency may soon find itself surround by solar panel on all side like the hole in the centre of miserable glass doughnut such be the wonderful nature of my constituent that the prime concern that they have express to be not for themselves their view or their wellbeing but for the security of the country specifically food security let we be very clear that use our good farmland for solar put we at risk in volatile world of be unable to feed our citizen the good and most versatile land be define as land in band and although land in be valuable and entirely useable resource for farmer in lincolnshire of solar installation area cover land in the good and most versatile land category my hon friend be make an excellent speech one issue not normally consider be the reinstatement provision after solar farm have be implement vast quantity of our prime agricultural land be be take out of production generally for term of to year should not consideration be give to the state of the organic matter the soil and the potential yield of that land after the term of year or long have end and the negative impact on our food production my hon friend be right but do not believe that the land will ever be return to farmland and many of my constituent feel the same it be worth note that of solar installation cover the good and most versatile land but test procure by the developer appear to suggest that soil be of poor quality than map from the department for environment food and rural affairs and local knowledge would have predict will the minister ensure that where soil testing be do the result be independently verify as my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes say lincolnshire be the nation breadbasket and produce of the uk vegetable the land in the county be also more productive than the uk average the wheat harvest there over the difficult past five year be above the uk average and it be much more productive than global average this be the land that we can least afford to lose do my hon friend agree that we face perfect storm of condition there be not just widespread societal push towards net zero but with change to agricultural property relief real risk that solar will become the new cash crop at the expense of valuable food production which be as essential as energy security my hon friend be right as farmer wife understand that farmer be be put under lot of pressure by the various change that this government have make to taxation on cab pick up inheritance tax national insurance and much more displace our farmland leave we reliant on import which use more land may have be produce to poor standard and require we to factor in transport emission the previous government take action by publish planning guidance that make it clear that the good and most versatile land should not be develop where alternative be available and those alternative be available be pleased to have sign my name to new clause to the planning and infrastructure bill which seek to prohibit solar development on high quality land and urge the government to support it let we not forget the tenant farmer who be often on multi generational tenancy they suddenly find their whole family without home or livelihood report for the welsh government on the impact of solar panel on agricultural land find that solar site risk cause soil compaction and structural damage which in some case may be permanent this mean that agriculture will suffer even after the somewhat hypothetical end of these solar scheme also ask the government to give due consideration to the three raf basis local to my constituency raf waddington raf cranwell and raf digby glint and glare from reflective panel will cause problem for pilot fly over these area our new pilot undergo basic training at cranwell and raf waddington be home to the red arrows it be huge joy for and many of my constituent to watch our nation iconic display team practise the loop the loop and roll into turn at high speed but the mile and mile of align panel create glint and glare could lead to disaster do the hon lady accept that pilot already seem to manage to fly throughout our nation and many other despite there be widespread solar panel in for instance spain where there be more sunshine it seem unlikely that they will be unable to manage in her constituency thank the hon lady for her intervention wonder if the average jumbo jet fly into heathrow do loop the loop on its way in raf digby be the headquarters of the joint cyber and electromagnetic activity group any interference with that part of the defence estate could cause significant harm my constituency of sleaford and north hykeham face an acute burden from the most high impact solar scheme colleague will know that project with capacity of more than mw be class as nationally significant infrastructure project four of these large scale scheme be propose for my constituency at springwell fosse green leoda and beacon fen their combine size be acre for context that land could support graze for more than sheep produce million loaf of bread and more than million weetabix fifth project just outside my constituency propose by labour donor be recently approve by the secretary of state what assurance can minister give my constituent that the department be assess cumulative impact appropriately we often hear that no more than of land will be use for solar panel however as we have see in my constituency the application for one giant solar farm lead to proposal for new substation to accommodate it which in turn lead to deluge of further giant solar project and battery storage application the cumulative effect will be to destroy the area with nearly of land in my constituency propose to be turn over to solar farm of the land in the neighbouring constituency represent by my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick and of the land in the constituency of my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh we can clearly see the clustering of application on our good farmland my hon friend the member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns have the mallard pass solar farm in her constituency congratulate she on the birth of her child recently which prevent she from be here know that this subject be big concern for she indeed it be concern for many of we include my right hon friend the members for newark for melton and syston edward argar and for louth and horncastle victoria atkins as member of the shadow cabinet protocol prevent they from speak in the debate but know that they would have wish to and will keep campaign the national policy statement say that installation should where possible use suitable previously develop land brownfield land contaminate land and industrial land where farmland must be use it note that poor quality land should be prefer to high quality land avoid the use of best and most versatile agricultural land where possible sadly the evidence so far suggest that the energy secretary be so ideologically wed to solar project that he have not appreciate the damage that giant solar project be cause to agricultural land this debate will hopefully demonstrate that cover our good farmland with massive solar project would be irreversibly damaging to the nation urge the minister to listen to my fellow mps and fellow citizen before it be too late rise order member can see that number of people wish to contribute so there will be time limit of four minute thank you for call so early on madam deputy speaker at the sunrise of the debate believe there be not only climate and biodiversity emergency but real insecurity in our energy market that be why absolutely back the government plan to triple our solar capacity and reach the clean power target by we need to look at the whole gamut of renewable energy out there include tidal although perhaps not so much in bedfordshire wind and solar power be very lucky that my constituency be home to the joint tall wind turbine in the country an honour share with my right hon friend the member for bristol north west darren jones when visit suggest that we put union flag on top of the one in my constituency so that it would be the tall but there be no agreement to that never mind my constituency be also home to solar farm in eggington as the minister know because he visit it with it produce enough power for home every year what be interesting be that as well as produce that clean green power it retain an agricultural use as the minister may remember there be also sheep graze between the solar panel nibble at the grass just to be clear this be not about what but where of course it be important that we have diverse energy mix but the hon lady must know that if we put solar panel on the good quality agricultural land we will have to import more food and extend supply chain and so damage the environment think we need mix but we can not rule out use solar panel on large chunk of land when the minister come along to visit our solar farm in eggington he not only meet the sheep but see that some of the land around the panel have be transform into wildflower meadow in my constituency aw group the people with the turbine be branch out into solar in the next couple of month it will build another solar array and again put in wildflower meadow those meadow be so important for biodiversity in our country as our pollinator and other insect face real problem learn on my visit that solar farm can also be useful to some of our ground nest bird which find shelter and sanctuary underneath the solar panel in essence just want to say that really welcome what the government be do welcome what they do yesterday the new rule make it easy for some of the small amount of power generate from solar panel to be link to our grid urge the minister to go full steam ahead on this and to make sure that our solar industry have really bright future in this time of biodiversity and climate emergency to understand this government approach to solar farm one should start by re read the labour manifesto page of the labour manifesto to be more precise know that it be only year ago but in its solemn promise to the british people it say labour recognise that food security be national security that be why we will champion british farming that may now seem long time ago because succession of announcement from this government have make it clear that there be no commitment to farming or to food security indeed that apply to many of their other commitment smash the gang council tax bill will not go up or energy bill will come down on food security and its importance to national security it be clear that it be fake promise indeed there be an irony here because we still have the ongoing covid inquiry be chief secretary to the treasury at the time of covid and it be clear to that at time of national crisis value for money change there be compete demand across nation for scarce resource assure members that at such crisis point food security become an issue of national security which be why the carelessness of the current government on their manifesto commitment matter so much my right hon friend make brilliant point do he also recognise that the way that this government have set up the arrangement they be guarantee to return on investment on these farm be in effect bribe farmer to move away from farming indeed the government be create an incentive to do the exact opposite of own manifesto pledge which be why start with that point let come on to the second place where we can see labour approach in the cabinet of course we can not witness the cabinet in action at first hand but it be very clear certainly to someone who have have the good fortune to sit in cabinet how marginalise the department for environment food and rural affairs have become we see the prime minister announce thing such as the compulsory purchase of farmland in order to support infrastructure scheme we see the former labour leader the secretary of state for energy security and net zero make whole raft of decision in his first few week of office on massive solar farm override defra we see the deputy prime minister rid roughshod over the defra secretary of state on housing scheme and we see the chancellor phone official at defra the night before to say that the sustainable farming incentive have be reduce so quickly that the government have now have to concede in legal case that their approach be wrong and allow further farm application to proceed and that be without any clear commitment in this area when warn at the election about labour farm tax the now defra secretary of state say that it be complete nonsense well we have see the government introduce that tax and watch while the treasury ride roughshod over the department we have department that be completely sideline in the government and fail to speak up not just for food security and farming but for the very commitment that be make in the labour manifesto we see theme run across whole range of policy announcement that show the instinct the value and the priority of this government who always believe that top down know well they do not believe in localism the implication for solar farm can be see in how the delivery of the policy be happen on the ground we be see cluster in the east of england as my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes would point out in area of the good food production we be see gaming of the system where the developer bring in consultant to grade the land in way that sit at odd with historic knowledge of the value of that land be delighted to endorse everything that my right hon friend and neighbour have say about national economic resilience the point about grade land be critical to be fair to the government they have say that land at grade and at least should be protect but the problem be that the solar developer deliberately attempt to distort those distinction by regrade land use organisation that be part of their own corporation my right hon friend be completely right the issue be hide in plain sight when be in the government and seek to strengthen the protection for farmland change to the guidance be make include bring forward independent certification for agricultural land classification in soil survey we know at constituency level that malpractice be go on and be not be challenge the point be that that be not by accident this be not an error of delivery this be by design and we can see that design in the raft of decision make by the energy secretary in his very first week in office indeed close to our constituency just near to cambridge there be an important announcement on mega farm which be make by the new secretary of state against official advice this matter because it be relate to wide trust in our politic clear commitment be give to rural community by labour in its manifesto that be be break will close conscious that many colleague want to participate in this debate with this comment for labour back benchers it may be that nos and have simply decide that with their majority they can afford to sacrifice number of their rural mp who have not be expect to win the election and it may by that they decide that those mp be not essential but it be baffle that there be so much silence these mp be vote for measure that be have such harmful effect in rural constituency and those measure be so short term that they be put our food security which do indeed matter to our national security at risk be pleased to follow the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay as he will find out shortly strongly support this government clean energy mission and want this country to be clean energy superpower want to see more wind tidal hydroelectric power and as will say later nuclear for the environment more renewable energy mean less air pollution low greenhouse gas and over time low flooding risk an issue that be very significant in my constituency and more stable climate for the economy more renewable energy will mean low energy price for household and business because we will not be dependent on gas price that be set by the global energy market as we see after the invasion of ukraine and the rocket energy price that follow we have no control over the global price for national security more renewable will deliver energy independence because instead of our country import fossil fuel from hostile authoritarian regime we can produce more of our own energy at home tragically these point have be lose on the conservative party which have give up on be ambitious about tackle climate change it simply do not believe that this country the birthplace of the industrial revolution have the will or the ability to build the world strong green economy reform policy seem to support the surrendering of control of our energy price to the global market give its commitment to fast track oil and gas development in the north sea and abolish subsidy for renewable energy my constituency be prove to be popular place for plan solar farm development primarily because of the above average number of sunshine hour that we have and our relatively flat land currently we have five solar farm project in my constituency which if they progress would qualify for nationally significant infrastructure project status there be few small one as well we want to play our part in folkestone and hythe in support this nation clean energy mission and believe that we should be do that in two way first by bring back nuclear energy generation at dungeness and secondly by take our fair share of solar development be glad that the government have commit to nuclear as part of our energy mix the hon gentleman say that he have five such proposal in his constituency do he support all five of those proposal in folkstone and hythe as will come on to say there be an issue about each area take its fair share of development it be absolutely key that we support the government clean energy mission and take our fair share but we need to make sure that it be fair share rise rise will not take any further intervention at this stage interruption member will hear what come on to say we have decommission nuclear power station in folkestone and hythe and strongly believe that it should be bring back for energy generation the site have the right location with proximity to the grid and local skill base for these technology such as advanced modular reactor be grateful to lord hunt the minister responsible for nuclear energy for his continued engagement on this issue but urge the government to move fast to create the condition for advanced modular reactor and other new technology to become reality on solar folkestone and hythe must play our part in deliver the government clean energy mission but it should not come at the expense of the fundamental character and beauty of the rural community people visit romney marsh for its tranquillity and beautiful landscape we must take our fair share of solar development to support the government clean energy mission but cover large area of romney marsh with multiple development will affect the character of the area one of the project would occupy square mile of countryside and there be four more in the pipeline it be entirely consistent to support the government mission and accept our fair share while say that there need to be principle limitation and reasonable amount of development that be the right position to take solar farm need to be evenly spread across the country the clean energy mission be national endeavour and we can not have one community in romney marsh face it on their own interruption if any hon member want to intervene and make legitimate point they be free to do so think the hon member be make part of the point that be try to make in my speech some of my constituency be the subject of solar panel application do he agree that that be an obscene amount of solar panel to put on our good quality farmland as say the whole country need to play its part in support the clean energy mission but there need to be fair share principle if all the area of the country with similar feature to my constituency play their part there would be less of an impact in particular area it be an entirely fair balance to strike the conservatives seem to be wed to the idea that net zero be something we should not aim for but they have absolutely no answer as to how we solve the climate crisis it might be worth make the point that only of solar application end up be build the cumulative number of application be completely irrelevant what matter be the number that be actually build on the land so while of constituency may be cover by application that be not reflection of the percentage that will be build on thank the hon member for his intervention as final point there be real concern about how ethical solar panel supply chain be it be so important that we have robust mechanism to ensure order have no choice but to impose three minute time limit on speech after the father of the house agree with the hon and learn member for folkestone and hythe tony vaughan let we all play our fair share and will support he on romney marsh if he support on gainsborough that be fair deal the distribution of solar farm across the country be as have be make clear highly uneven of the parliamentary constituency have more than of land take up by solar development while have more than and have more than the five most affected constituency be newark with of land take up by solar farm sleaford and north hykeham with newport east with my own belove gainsborough with and selby with say to the hon and learn member for folkestone and hythe that this be debate not about solar farm or green energy but the sheer concentration of solar farm in some part of england that concentration be ironically on some of the good land for grow that be the problem there seem to be correlation between the most productive farmland and the concentration of solar application my hon friend be absolutely right will the right hon member give way will make some progress and give way in moment must be fair to other people there be solar scheme total acre within mile radius of the small town of gainsborough madam deputy speaker can please use visual aid here this map show load of solar think get away with it the secretary of state approve these project immediately they go through his desk within week the cumulative effect of these solar installation be colossal in one small area with numerous site have be propose and accept in lincolnshire want to say something to the minister can he concentrate on what be say for moment because this be terribly important be listen we be not argue against solar farm all we be beg the minister to do be take they together we can not have all these separate public inquiry we have to look at the acre all over gainsborough be that not fair point otherwise it be totally unfair on one particular area that be the only point we be make this be all do on cheat so call nationally significant infrastructure project which be device bring in by tony blair for nuclear power station and that sort of installation the government be bypass local democracy that be what be so unfair and it be why people feel disenfranchised in certain part of england agree that if the government distribute solar farm fairly all over the country as the hon and learn member for folkestone and hythe say there would be no argument but the fact be that they be concentrate they so much in one small area of england that be the argument would just point out that the reason we get that concentration grid capacity the grid be constrain in the area where there be the high level of demand it be unconstrained in the area where we have the least amount of demand which be rural area that be why we keep get application there if we upgrade the grid we will not have that problem that lead to the point of whether solar power be really an efficient way of achieve green energy it be land intensive with time more land need compare with gas and it be inefficient during winter or cloudy period there be doubt about the carbon footprint there be no clear evidence that energy generation over year panel lifespan justify the embody energy use in panel production and we be never give reassurance on that point there be also environmental and safety issue place battery energy storage system in each field raise safety risk due to potential thermal runaway incident there be inadequate planning to provide water for firefighting in these field there be economic and community concern for instance negative effect on local tourism of the visual impact and the lack of community benefit from large scale solar project compare with traditional local decision making and again make the national infrastructure point there be social and ethical concern about possible connection between project stakeholder and force labour in china and we would like reassurance from the minister in that regard ask he about that yesterday in the chamber know we have achieve something with great british energy but in this case we be talk about private company on which the concession that the minister make yesterday will have no impact there will be an impact on great british energy involvement if it can be prove that the solar panel be make with slave labour but private company will be able to go directly ahead want to reply to the point make by my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes solar installation will take over good agricultural land which be vital for lincolnshire role as the breadbasket of england some of regional farmland could be lose undermine local agriculture which be crucial for food security and sustainable farming in conclusion cover our countryside with solar energy installation be environmentally harmful economically unsustainable threat to food security and damage to local agriculture and tourism local opposition be widespread and strong and the harm outweigh the benefit seek permission for these site via the use of nationally significant infrastructure project be an abuse of nsips and subvert local democracy it be part of this net zero craze that provide poor global value for money it cost the uk taxpayer billion and the net effect be cancel out by minuscule increase in chinese emission these application should be take in the round and if necessary refuse last year get elect on labour manifesto that pledge to make britain clean energy superpower that will create job cut bill boost our energy security and reduce the carbon emission that be kill our planet have have so many conversation with people in west bromwich who agree that it be no brainer if we continue to rely on oil and gas from abroad we will be at the mercy of spike in price with the whim of foreign dictator affect the energy bill of ordinary family in britain our renewable energy from solar wind and wave power be free we have hear passionate argument from hon member who be concerned about solar farm as an mp from an industrial urban area it be not my job to speak for mp represent rural community but do want to challenge the idea that solar energy be somehow threat to our countryside in fact solar take up about time less land than that give over to golf course my dad be big golf fan so be not attack the golf industry but if solar be threaten our food security be golf course not do the same solar be also help to restore nature accord to research by the royal society for the protection of birds and cambridge university which find that solar farm contain great number of bird specie than the surround arable land few hon member have ask why we do not just put solar on rooftop the government be also do that the black country which represent be proud manufacturing area and as we look out across west bromwich and oldbury we can see huge number of factory and industrial roof the hon member refer to industrial activity do she agree that the predominant industrial activity that solar support be far eastern manufacturing of solar pv what would she say in response to sir richard dearlove the former head of who say in january that by pursue this route we be in effect cede control over national security and resilience to foreign power the hon member and have nearby constituency the company in my constituency that put solar on their roof will see their energy bill reduce and they could put more energy back into the grid they think this will be big benefit to their business there be no formal estimate of the amount of factory roof in the black country but to take local example william king one of west brom long run metal processing business have square metre of warehousing facility that be almost three hectare of rooftop that could be use to generate solar power it have already make start instal solar panel and hope that the or so other manufacture business in my constituency will soon follow suit light up the black country with solar will drive local growth create new job build new skill and power industry in our manufacturing heartland there be still many challenge to the private sector make the most of the solar opportunity many of which the government be work to address include upgrade the grid so that factory can give away excess energy to local school and deliver quick new grid connection we also need to make the business rate system even more pro solar at the moment if business install solar panel on its roof and consume all that electricity itself there should be no increase to the rateable value however local business have raise concern that if they generate excess energy through their solar panel and want to sell that back to the grid their business rate may increase that create disincentive for company to install maximum number of solar panel and generate additional clean energy meet my hon friend the minister just last week and we have good discussion about the full range of option at our disposal to make rooftop solar the norm and not the exception be excited about what unleash the full potential of solar across the black country and britain could mean it will reduce our exposure to fossil fuel and their volatile price end our dependence on international market and ultimately bring down household bill across britain we be on the brink of clean energy revolution we should seize the opportunity to unleash the full potential of solar power across our country include by light up the black country use our plentiful factory roof the only less environmentally friendly form of power generation than solar panel in the united kingdom be the drax power station which be forest feed it be complete myth to suggest that somehow there be no carbon price to be pay for solar farm neither be they efficient give the lack of sunlight in most of the united kingdom the amount of power feed into the grid from solar panel be minimal we be talk about sacrifice acre of agricultural land some of it have already go to no useful purpose whatsoever it be time that we grow up and recognise that at business question this morning ask the leader of the house if she would go to the prime minister and bang few head together because the secretary of state for energy security and net zero and the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs be not sing from the same song sheet the argument be simply not join up we can not go on sacrifice agricultural land such as that surround the village of hoath in my constituency or the minster marsh or the land around sandwich and in west thanet and still expect to have food sufficiency we be talk about land that this summer be grow bread make wheat but in two or three year will be grow house and solar panel that be simply not compatible in term of policy urge the minister to go away and think about this very carefully indeed to take the message to the secretary of state and to ensure that there be some join up thinking before it be too late be afraid that be dead in the water and it be time we recognise that the way forward will be north sea gas and oil to bridge the gap between where we be now and small nuclear reactor it be time that we recognise that and stop mess around with pie in the sky scheme congratulate the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson on secure the debate which be an important one for my constituent and indeed the whole county of norfolk we have see sudden influx of solar farm application which have become one of the most contentious and speak about issue locally to be clear from the outset be not nimby or even rural nimby as have be refer to of late support the government growth agenda and welcome the much need growth in my constituency be also not anti solar or indeed anti solar farm recognise the need for energy security and support the net zero ambition but we must approach these challenge and their solution pragmatically with due regard for local community and recognise the implication that be why be work cross party with the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman in establish the breckland solar alliance in response to solar farm proposal that cut across both our constituency to ensure that the voice of our resident business and stakeholder be hear and that party politic do not get in the way of such an important issue be listen with interest to what the hon member have to say and have some sympathy with it but do he have any specific proposal for how we deal with the nationally significant infrastructure project approach which completely overrule what he be talk about encourage the right hon member to let get to the end of my speech as may answer his question will then be happy to have conversation with he the fact be that renewable energy project be not evenly distribute across the country in norfolk our terrain be flat and quite sandy so it be relatively easy to get thing into the ground with the likelihood of increase pylon capacity we be attractive to solar project and we be get more than our fair share of application for solar farm which place increase burden on certain community one of my particular concern about the influx of application be the impact on food security all too often agricultural land have become the default option for solar farm because it can be cheap than alternative when deploy at scale not because that be the right social and environmental option solar farm be not be sit on just any old agricultural land either they be be sit disproportionately on well quality farmland rather than on poor quality land there be three time more grade agricultural land in the uk than grade land with grade be the low quality land as mention early and grade be the good yet solar installation occupy time more grade land than grade land that can not be desirable or indeed acceptable firmly believe that grade agricultural land and above should be protect and prioritise for food production the national planning policy framework consider grade and land as the good and most versatile land and prioritise its protection yet that prioritisation be clearly not influence in the proposal will the hon member give way will not as have limit time apology take the droves solar farm application in my constituency if approve of the application site would cover grade land and about third of the land to be use would be good and most versatile we be already see long and hotter summer in norfolk and that add to the challenge for farmer irrigation be need more frequently add to the cost and more land be become unviable for food production as have say before be fully behind pro green economy and ensure that renewable energy be not something for the future but for now have huge sympathy with the minister and the team because our energy security be in an appalling state after year of conservative government we have live through soar energy bill and fuel poverty and we need cheap clean energy but that can not come at any cost there be alternative so let we recognise that and celebrate the fact that the uk be world leader in offshore wind with far more capacity than any other country may congratulate the hon member for south west norfolk terry jermy on what he have to say he be at least responsive to local interest in this we have hear number of rather glib comment about this and that percentage of land let we just look at it from an individual point of view last monday the east yorkshire solar farm in my constituency cover acre be approve not many policy make angry in this place but this one do for my constituent why because decision ride roughshod over the desire wish and express complaint of my constituent the solar farm will cover an area the size of durham let we imagine if we be apply to build town the size of durham how long the planning would take yet this go through effectively on the nod and the so call consultation process be little more than rubber stamp operation why do say that because there be lot of sensible and constructive input from my constituent and some from and no attention whatsoever be pay to any of they in try quite properly to save the global environment the government be cause untold harm to the local environment in britain and in so do they will fail in their first aim do the right hon gentleman recognise that the conservatives failure to have proper national strategy for development mean that we do not have enough prison place to lock up all of our criminal and that not have sufficient solar energy will do the same unless the hon lady be talk about the suntan of the criminal be not quite sure what the relevance of that be she be one of the one who be pick number out of the air with this small percentage and that small percentage be point out the actual effect on ordinary citizen and it be not the bland view that she have put forward acre solar farm be disproportionate for any part of the country because it surround village and make life miserable for people multiple town and village will be completely surround by the east yorkshire solar farm another one the mylen leah solar farm which would cover another acre be propose for right next door that will effectively be acre be not very optimistic about the attitude of the government in the approval process we have also hear slightly sneer reference to nimbys what be we talk about here we be talk about actual people in my constituency they range from pensioner who have spend their entire life saving to go and live in quiet part of the country with beautiful view who will instead have view of black plastic to people not very far from who buy place in the country because they have get child who be severely autistic and need the peace and quiet and the rural environment that be provide we have people who take low salary to work in the country because that be what they want we have people who be commit there in farm and rural industry they be the so call nimbys and they do not want their life ruin that be what we be here to defend when survey my resident as my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson do find that be against the size of the farm and against the overwhelming impact they be not against the idea they be against the ridiculous way this be be do be run out of time so will make one other point about the ill thought through nature of the policy it depend on access to the grid therefore the reason have farm of acre acre probably more be that we be near drax on the grid that encourage concentration of huge farm in concentrated area all over the country where ordinary people will have their life destroy by an ill thought through rotten policy be proud that britain have set ambitious target for clean energy we want of our energy to come from carbon power source by the government be change the planning system as we have hear so they can deliver the renewable energy of the future it be important that the benefit of that ambition be feel by we all and be keen to ensure that my constituency of north northumberland be not overlook in the new energy race that mean that our solar farm should be local farmer friendly and effective so that they serve my constituent as well as the whole country we have hear phrase such as large scale prime agricultural land lot we just have to think through where the solar farm be go to be it need not be an either or as seem to have be suggest here at time first it be crucial that solar farm have local support and be root in community know many in north northumberland want renewable community energy that directly benefit they and their neighbourhood now have speak to very small rural community in my constituency that be well on their way in their attempt to get local solar farm they want to sign up to the ambition of great british energy for the future we want to make sure that solar panel be part of everyday life in the government estimate that there be quarter of million hectare of south face commercial roof in the uk we should make good use of those roof to ensure that new build home for example have solar panel for the benefit of their owner and their neighbourhood that be entirely legitimate secondly solar farm must go hand in glove with farmer in north northumberland we have highly productive land that be outstanding for local farmer and for our national food security it be therefore crucial that we use our scarce land for the good possible purpose however let we be clear to the conservative party which claim to be for farmer and the party of free choice and small business it be for those farmer and landowner to decide whether they want to diversify early research by lancaster university suggest that sheep farming sheep grazing and solar farm actually call go hand in hand solar farm could represent one strand of healthy diversification for many farm business and welcome that have be listen carefully to the hon gentleman point include about the opportunity for agrivoltaic suspect that lot of resident would be more open to solar farm if they be combine with food grow in the way that he have describe yet those be not the sort of application that see come forward in east anglia will he ask the government to be strong in their planning policy to encourage and require solar farm that be combine with food grow be just about to say that welcome the government propose new land use framework which think be key the land use framework which no government have have before will help landowner make sensible and effective decision with their land trust that will include strong focus on both food production and renewable energy finally and most importantly solar farm must lead to low bill be optimistic that as we ease the influence of foreign dictator off our energy supply and generate more of our own renewable energy the british people will begin to see the benefit skilled job and low bill will be the reward for the country that win the clean energy race and the good reward for investment in solar and wind power will be low bill for my constituent in north northumberland we have hear lot of what think be false dichotomy here today for instance from the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay set up that false dichotomy between food security and energy security be not the way forward we must do both together want my constituent to be part of the national conversation as we move towards net zero they be keen to see low emission low bill and local job and that mean ensure that solar farm be local farmer friendly and effective so that they serve the british people well order we will have two minute time limit from after the next speaker call llinos medi ynys môn be know as energy island however support for clean energy should not undermine our community the current plan for huge solar farm on ynys môn do exactly that at present we have proposal for the alaw môn and maen hir solar farm which would cover acre that be nearly of the island total land huge area those solar farm would be build on good quality agricultural land ynys môn be not oppose to solar energy the island already host several solar farm such as bryn yr odyn bodorgan and porth wen in addition traffwll solar farm await construction we be play more than our part in the green transition from solar to wind from marine to nuclear ynys môn be also know as the mother of wales because the island fertile land have serve as the breadbasket of wales build these project on good agricultural land undermine food security and the agricultural sector which be vital part of our economy the hon lady highlight food security and energy security which be often highlight as be in competition in this debate be it not the truth that both be crucial for sustainable future and that it be not clear how the government will relate the strategic spatial energy plan to the land use framework do she agree that both have to work together under clear national strategy the current approach to large solar be sign of lack of strategic planning but also of lack of food security planning ynys môn have unesco global geopark status to recognise its outstanding geological heritage and to manage it for conservation education and sustainable be the crucial word the propose solar farm be not sustainable for ynys môn and would totally undermine the island global geopark status propose to the government that solar deployment should follow hierarchy in order to good suit the need of local community first solar should be integrate into new build domestic commercial and industrial building by build developer it should then be retrofit to exist building by the building owner be deeply concerned that the government be back developer over local community when it come to control over land there be huge risk of development consent order be use by developer to buy up land against the wish of landowner the threat of dco give developer leverage over landowner to take on decommissioning cost for solar farm what assessment have the minister make of that trend do he believe that dco be be misuse by developer in wales we have country to keep piece of land as proof of our right to survive coal slate water our natural resource have be extract from our deprive community for the benefit of other the land of our father have be strip of valuable resource and the profit take out of wales it be only fair that community in ynys môn and the rest of wales be respect push through large solar project that be at odd with the need of local people be not the way forward the government must change course end the pattern of extraction and put welsh community at the heart of their solar strategy have be give two minute so will get straight to the point and talk about whitestone last july after be elect as the mp for rother valley make solemn promise to my constituent that would always put their interest first the whitestone proposal have raise real concern among resident and have hold numerous public meeting and consultation since the proposal first come to my desk last november numerous concern have be raise by resident and have make those very clear to the developer as the proposal have develop will share the three major concern that stand out the first be the sheer scale of the proposal it would change the very nature of the area we enjoy the second be the particular location that be affect four beautiful village ulley brampton en le morthen harthill and kiveton park would potentially be engulf by the whitestone proposal have have conversation with the developer be pleased that there have already be reduction of but hope for much more the third be the issue of tenant farmer it be right as have be raise that many landowner may choose to engage with the solar farm market and that be their choice we live in free economy but for tenant farmer the situation be somewhat different have tenant farmer in my constituency who have farm land for generation if not century who feel that they be under threat and want to support they as be my role simply urge the developer in come forward with its proposal later this year to take into account the thousand of resident who have raise serious concern about the proposal as they stand urge the developer to make its proposal proportionate and fair ensure that we get fair deal out of the transition to green economy pay tribute to the hon member for south west norfolk terry jermy and for rother valley jake richards for take brave stance against their government whips and stand up for their constituent against these reckless solar farm proposal today debate be on solar energy but the point intend to make apply to more than just this type of energy infrastructure the manner in which these project be be pursue aggressively and without due care be begin to cause major backlash there be rapidly grow fear that solar and renewable project be be force through and greenlit for installation against the wish of the people who will have to live next to they the net zero at all cost agenda of this labour government which be enthusiastically endorse by the snp at holyrood cause great concern across the country and for good reason protect the environment should not come at the expense of our economy job and countryside the approach of labour and the snp need to change major infrastructure project be particular issue in rural constituency like mine in the scottish borders where the countryside be not some far off place we speak wistfully about it be where we live the countryside be part of our community when solar project be propose that be big than some town it be deeply worry for local people time and again when look at project across my constituency see scandalous lack of regard for the view of local people they be give little information be overlook and even ignore and then expect to just agree with the project labour and the snp might think that be acceptable but conservative members do not we believe that it be wrong and that people should not have to put up with it the climate crisis grow more urgent and our child future be under threat solar energy will play crucial role in the mission to produce secure affordable energy in this country since the general election the government have consent to more solar power project than be consent to over the entirety of the past year great british energy be invest million in new rooftop solar energy panel include for the roof of the newly build leighton hospital near my constituency and in renewable energy scheme for school hospital and community that will take hundred of million of pound off public sector energy bill new building standard will ensure that all new build house and commercial building be fit for net zero future the standard be expect to encourage the installation of solar panel and welcome that it be critical that we exclude slave labour from the supply chain for solar panel both on moral ground and to enable alternative producer to compete on fair playing field much of the global supply of solar grade polysilicon key component of solar panel be manufacture in xinjiang china where over million uyghur muslims be imprison in vast network of force labour camp this week meet people from open doors to learn more about its work tackle religious persecution around the world it say in its report that in xinjiang you be always watch computer decide your fate against which there be no appeal be my hon friend surprise to hear that despite our deep concern about solar panel production in china there be virtually zero investment in the uk solar production during the conservatives time in office since we come to power order we really must have short intervention or will not be able to get every member in agree with hon friend that be disgraceful and be very pleased that the relaunche solar taskforce be focus on develop resilient and sustainable supply chain free from forced labour it be important that we work with our farmer and grower across the country british farmer own about of our total solar generation capacity whether it be on the roof of their agricultural building or on solar farm be extremely pleased that the nfu be participate in the government relaunche solar taskforce we must continue to ensure that farm be properly consult about land use and that previously develop or low quality land be prioritise thank the business in my community that have support solar energy include manufacturer siemens and bespak which both use renewable energy source the dane valley community energy company be not for profit mutual society that be set up by group of volunteer in my constituency they have construct and run the congleton hydroelectricity generation project at havannah weir and they supply electricity to siemens and donate money to local community group sister project congleton solar have instal rooftop solar on number of site in my constituency and beyond havannah primary school in my constituency will officially unveil its rooftop solar panel next week know that the project will inspire the next generation of green champion be very proud to be part of government who be meet community where they be and follow their lead obviously like to bring people together in consensus and think there be consensus in the house that there be place for solar on roof of course like to lead by example so have put solar panel on the roof of my industrial building then one can sell electricity to the occupier beneath and ease the considerable pressure on the national grid surely solar farm be completely inappropriate we have be hear about thousand and thousand of acre of solar farm in the great glorious county of lincolnshire there be application and plan for acre of solar panel on top quality farmland that be completely inappropriate it would destroy not only that farmland but this have not be mention great job in the county of lincolnshire for the next to year that be absolute madness it be also so unfair those live in village or small town in the countryside might all of sudden find themselves surround not by glorious field but by black plastic there be no justification for that or fairness in it be sure that my hon friend be aware of the large battery energy storage plant that will be require as we use more solar farm but be he aware of the danger that they pose to the public and the environment be most grateful to my hon friend the member for common sense most solar farm now include huge battery storage system which we have learn be very dangerous three of they have go up in flame just this year in the united kingdom the fire can not be put out they must be leave to burn out what happen when those system burn toxic fume be release include hydrogen fluoride and toxin seep into the ground as we have learn from california where one go up in flame there be massive danger from those battery storage system but nobody be talk about that and by the way no one know who be responsible for battery storage system health and safety have solar development in my constituency and there be proposal for battery storage solution the hon gentleman mention safety be hop to address that through an amendment to the planning and infrastructure bill that would require relevant fire authority to be statutory consultee would he support that would be very interested the fact be that fire department in county up and down the country do not have the resource manpower or willingness to take on these safety risk that should be the subject of separate big important debate we be all concerned about health and safety surely nobody want to live next to something dangerous and toxic that could cause entire village to be evacuate as thermal runaway mean that the fire can not be put out be conscious that other member wish to speak we need great understanding of these battery storage system rise not just as the member for mid norfolk but as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture as member will be aware norfolk be britain first county and our leading agricultural county the royal norfolk show be the premier show in the country norfolk be absolutely at the vanguard of this country agricultural industry and of the government state although increasingly cynically state commitment to increase food security the globe have to double food production in the next year on the same land area with half as much water and energy and norfolk be in the vanguard when it come to the technology with which to do that there be the drought resistant crop and the gene edit disease resistant crop at the norwich research park in my constituency of mid norfolk the home of banham poultry and cranswick country foods farming and agriculture be the no industry employ thousand in agricultural machinery supply haulage and food processing cheer when hear that the government be go to support the agricultural industry and food production and cheer their commitment to support uk science include the agricultural science that be key to meet that challenge but since the election we have see the most extraordinary attack on farm the rural economy and small business take on job there be also proposal for acre that be square mile or km solar farm reach from castle acre through swaffham to dereham this be in constituency where agriculture food and tourism be the no industry government members need to reflect on this want renewable energy and want cheap energy my constituent would like to be consult the resident of village will wake up live in the middle of power station with no serious planning consultation at all no community benefit and the rate be take back to london by ministers this be an utterly cynical move towards the industrialisation of the countryside which will rebound seriously on the labour party and more importantly on this country food and energy system it be wrong call the liberal democrat spokesman should declare that prior to enter this house spend the well part of decade work in renewable energy finance while would not claim to be solar expert could certainly write whole speech debunk thing that have be say today for the record solar panel have low carbon footprint per unit generate than the equivalent fossil fuel they be recyclable and any solar farm development require glint and glare report before it get approval if it be anywhere near an air force base or an airport will move on because could go on for long time those of we who believe in science know that tackle climate change mean make bold practical choice about how we decarbonise our economy if we be serious about reach net zero tackle fuel poverty and protect our countryside we have to make renewable work for people as well as the planet have often make the point that the solar sector be not particularly good at communicate the benefit of just transition to the population at large so let be clear solar power mean cheap bill for consumer protection against geopolitical insecurity and greener future for the next generation be listen carefully to the hon gentleman so that we in this house and the whole country can hear clearly be he say that the liberal democrats fully support solar farm the hon gentleman will be pleased to know that the answer be in my speech we have make substantial progress on decarbonise our power grid decade ago just of our energy come from renewable and today the figure stand at that be national achievement we should be proud of but we must go far not just because the climate emergency demand it but because renewable be the cheap source of energy available liberal democrats believe strongly in expand use of solar and other renewable to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel improve energy security and bring down bill crucially we believe that this must be do while protect our natural environment strategic land use framework be essential if we be serious about deliver net zero while safeguard our ability to produce food and restore nature we be ask more and more of the countryside to produce food capture carbon generate clean energy support biodiversity and provide space for housing tourism and recreation without join up approach we risk pit these priority against one another it be vital that framework give clear national guidance on where solar be most appropriate set out that solar should avoid high quality agricultural land wherever possible and encourage dual use solution that support both energy generation and nature recovery it must enable local authority to plan ahead with confidence and to balance compete pressure in way that reflect the need and character of their community planning policy should not be dictate solely by where grid connection be available but by long term vision of how we want our land to be use it be common claim that instead of put solar panel on field we should put they on rooftop and car park do not disagree but have work in the sector feel obligated make this point lot to explain the commercial reality if utility scale solar cost per unit to build rooftop solar be roughly double that and carport double that again meanwhile energy company pay as little as or per unit for energy export to the grid that mean that pure export rooftop and carport solar do not stack up financially for investor but that be something that the government can fix by mandate minimum export price we could unlock rooftop and car port investment reduce pressure on farmland and cut consumer bill yes wholesale energy buyer would earn little less but consumer community and the climate would all benefit this be an easy win for government who have state their commitment to net zero ground mount solar will invariably remain part of the energy mix and we can not reach our climate target without it but project must be do right which mean prioritise low grade land and ensure that new scheme come with tangible benefit for the community they affect community benefit fund should receive fair share of the wealth create my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos have table new clause to the planning and infrastructure bill to deliver just that alongside local authority power to invest in energy efficiency and support street by street upgrade to reduce bill in scotland for example community benefit be worth per instal megawatt per year that mean that controversial large scale solar project such as the kingsway solar farm in the constituency of my hon friend the member for south cambridgeshire pippa heylings would provide million annually to the local community that be the scale we should be talk about and it must be the community that determine how and where that money be spend today about two third of uk solar be ground mount but rooftop solar have critical role to play and the liberal democrats be proud to be lead on that issue we welcome the government decision to adopt our policy of mandate solar panel on the roof of new home which be core part and first step of our rooftop revolution we also call on ministers to go far by require new home to meet net zero building standard and include provision for solar generation when it come to delivery liberal democrats in local government be show what can be do from barkham solar farm in wokingham to sandscale park in westmorland and the thousand of car park panel instal in portsmouth we be deliver clean energy at scale back by community delivery must also be responsible and know that many of we be concerned about the number of solar farm be approve on our good agricultural land let be clear be yet to meet farmer who get into farming because they want to grow solar panel this be happen because make living from farming be increasingly impossible we must ensure that farming be sustainable profitable and properly support so that farmer can keep do what they do good which be produce brilliant british food and look after the land also share concern about the use of nationally significant infrastructure project scheme which be take land out of use that raise question about long term land use and oversight particularly give the level of foreign investment in the sector finally very quick word on standard appreciate that be test your patience madam deputy speaker there be genuine concern about labour practice in the global solar supply chain but the industry be take action have be part of the solar energy uk supply chain sustainability working group when it be first constitute can personally attest that the industry be take the issue very seriously through the solar stewardship initiative robust environmental social and governance and traceability standard be be apply to ensure compliance with uk and eu law by the end of this year certify facility will be produce gw of panel annually which be five time the uk current capacity as result we can be confident that we can meet our target without compromise our value the potential of solar be enormous it can drive down bill reduce emission and create thousand of job as well as protect our countryside call the shadow minister may pause to pay tribute to those back benchers who be not able to contribute today the passion about this issue be evidence by the number of conservative members present two minute be an inadequate amount of time in which to describe the distress that many of their constituent feel will try to encapsulate what have hear they say but it will not do justice to the amount of anguish that rural community be feel in this solar farm debate we be talk about an attack on rural community it be an attack on farmer on tenant farmer and on the english rural way of life do not hear people complain about solar farm be build in industrial area or on rooftop hear complaint about acre solar farm destroy the countryside destroy village and be build with no concern for the community they will leave behind pay tribute to my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson by secure debate on this important subject on the floor of the house she have do the house tremendous service moreover my hon friend have do much more and she deserve recognition for that she have work tirelessly on the issue over number of year fight for her constituent can testify to that as be the designated whip when we be in government no member from any part of the house bother we more on the issue of the importance of protect rural community from solar farm expansion she secure vital change from the last government to limit where solar farm could be build change that this government have now undo solar have role in our energy mix include on rooftop and in south face industrial area but it carry significant cost and bring dependency on china and force labour supply chain that be questionable and should concern we all despite what the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for west dorset edward morello may say my constituency have acre of raise reservoir and there be member in the house from england alone who have raise reservoir in their constituency but the debate have not cover the potential for float solar do the shadow minister agree that if the forthcoming government solar road map do not contain substantial amount on float solar on raise reservoir then we will have miss massive opportunity thank my hon friend for his excellent point may suggest that he apply to the backbench business committee for debate on that topic there be such interest today that be sure that debate on float solar would be welcome by the house many people be affect by this issue pay tribute to member on the labour benches for their bold willingness to stand up for their constituent it be difficult to do that and be very impressed that they have do so the government may struggle to understand that it be possible to be pro solar energy while raise legitimate concern about where and how that expansion affect community our countryside farmer and food security do the shadow minister agree that if we continue to permit application for solar farm in the countryside include those at weatheroak and hunnington in my constituency we erode our agricultural self sufficiency and that it be important that this government do not betray the countryside any more than they already have do as the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs represent constituency in croydon it be perhaps understandable that he may misinterpret the need of rural community we need to continue to highlight the plight of rural community and how such issue affect they and we must allow for proper debate in the house about these important topic hold the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks in high regard and hope that his response will recognise and encompass the concern and issue that have be raise today know that his brief cover several departments and that that bring challenge but the government need to address three key area of concern the loss of high quality agricultural land the clustering of development application link to solar farm and the importance of community consent on the loss of high quality agricultural land my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham eloquently set out why that matter to her constituent it also matter to constituent in mid norfolk where acre development be propose do the shadow minister agree that as well as all the point that have be make about agriculture and solar there be democratic point here resident in village in my patch and in many other will find that they be live in the middle of power station let we name it for what it be power station they think that each village will have bit of solar but they will be live in an industrial power station that should not be allow to happen without proper planning consultation and proper compensation could not agree more with what my hon friend say there be lack of compensation for rural community and no offer of low energy bill or discount on offset the cost of energy these local community will sacrifice their green space livelihood and way of life for energy that will not give they direct benefit in lincolnshire this issue have huge impact we see solar application in constituency particularly in the constituency of my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham where they cover of the overall available land my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh in lincolnshire face of land in his constituency be consume by solar that be shocking across the country my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick face of land in his constituency be consume by solar farm lincolnshire agricultural land be vital to our food security but it be under threat developer see this land as the fast and easy pathway to solar farm development enable by government who seem to place no importance on our food security the countryside alliance recently highlight that tenant farmer face threat appreciate that that be raise by the hon member for rother valley jake richards and appreciate his boldness in do that those tenant farmer be be evict to make way for solar farm tenant farmer be not landowner they work the land and they be be evict so that solar farm can be put in place as my right hon friend the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay and the father of the house my right hon friend the member for gainsborough point out we be lose farmland and farmer and our food security in the reckless ideological pursuit of net zero that be why his majesty opposition have table new clause to the planning and infrastructure bill which would limit where solar farm can be build on agricultural land what assessment have the government make of the impact of solar farm application on the loss of agricultural land and tenant farmer in area such as lincolnshire and on our national food security will the minister look at way to incentivise the development of solar capacity away from agricultural land as developer seek easy access to agricultural land this lead to clustering effect which many conservative members mention we hear mention of acre development in east yorkshire which couple with another acre development mean that acre of land in east yorkshire be be consume by solar farm the need for these application to cluster around substation for cost effective grid connection be create an overwhelming impact in area such as lincolnshire suffolk buckinghamshire east yorkshire norfolk and across our rural community in england and the south of scotland particularly want to pay tribute to my hon friend order be sure that the shadow minister will bring her remark to close very shortly will madam deputy speaker hope that we can address this issue in the house again very soon because there be much more to be say on this important matter my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith be not able to make all of his remark and many member be not able to raise their concern finally will talk about community consent which have be raise so many time already today we need to ensure that we be listen to these community not ignore they and bulldoze over our green space our countryside and our agricultural land for the sake of relentless net zero target that will destroy our rural way of life mention again that agricultural land be be consume by this government at an alarming rate farming capacity be be lose as tenant farmer be evict whole county be be cover in cluster of solar farm local community be be ignore and expert be be overridden those be the reality of solar strategy drive by ideology ahead of evidence urge the minister to heed the concern that hon and right hon member have raise so forcefully today and to change course urgently begin by congratulate the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson on secure debate on this important issue it be the first day in while that westminster have not be bask in sunlight although do note contrary to some contribution make by conservative members that solar be currently generate of this country electricity more than any other technology solar play critical role in our energy mix the hon lady ask whether would meet she to discuss proposal in her constituency of course be very happy to meet she to discuss these issue as meet member across the house welcome all or perhaps should say some of the contribution to today debate when the debate begin be not expect the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice to endorse the clean power mission so comprehensively not only endorse our rooftop solar revolution but lead the way in his own industrial empire will include he in the next newsletter on the clean power mission be sure he will happily receive it know that we be short on time but be happy to briefly outline the government position and respond to some of the numerous point that have be make also hold the shadow minister the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey in high regard and will respond to some of her point over the course of my speech the clean power mission that this government have embark on be not about ideology it be about deliver energy security climate leadership and the only way in which we can move away from volatile fossil fuel set our constituent bill which be what so many have face over the past few year it be the only way to create well pay industrial job and deliver the clean power mission right across the country my hon friend the member for north northumberland david smith reference community benefit and the benefit to individual of instal solar panel on their own roof he be absolutely right about that and will return to the issue of rooftop shortly welcome my hon friend contribution as he be former pupil at park mains where use to teach although for the record he be not pupil when be teach there my hon friend also make the point which want to reiterate that this be not battle between food security and energy security will just say one thing which be sure conservative members will strongly endorse solar project and agricultural practice can co exist for example the science of agrivoltaic be develop in which solar be integrate with arable farming in innovative way that be come on in leap and bound official report april vol we can achieve food security and energy security together for our united kingdom the minister and have have this conversation number of time he will be aware that paragraph of state that good and most versatile land should not be use for solar farm he have already inform that no solar farm in the country use more than of good and most versatile land will he commit to hard limit on how much of that land can be use for solar project as think say the last time we have this exchange always welcome the hon gentleman numerous write parliamentary question to it be treat to see they every morning and he do raise important point be not go to put figure on it right now but we have clearly say that it be important to find the right balance when it come to good use agricultural land will come back to that issue the hon gentleman do not let get to my point just speak about this not be competition between energy security and food security those be the word of the shadow energy secretary the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie not that many month ago before the conservatives go down the hole of deny that the climate crisis be real thing and that our energy security and food security can co exist that be their policy when the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham last bring this debate to the house which think be nine month ago the minister say that this be not competition between energy security and farming security it should not be the reason it be become one be that his government be allow our good and most versatile farmland use for grow crop to be take over by solar farm thank the hon lady for her point but it be not say that this be not competition it be her own shadow energy secretary just few month ago do not accept her point either will come to that very briefly but in bit more detail in second let we not forget that this be also about tackle the climate crisis the conservatives might be willing to ignore that crisis but the truth be that time and again they forget that climate change will have devastating impact on agriculture and on land across this country we have to do something about that and this be part of it solar will be part of our energy security in the future although it will not make up the entirety of our clean power system will the minister give way will make bit of progress because be conscious that another debate be to start soon rooftop solar as many member have raise be important it be not an either or we see real opportunity to put solar on every possible rooftop right across the country we have announce our ambition for new home and for industrial building we recently launch consultation or call for evidence on car park too if there be rooftop that we can put solar panel on we be keen to do so but there will also be role for ground mount solar to play finally on this point the public also support solar many opposition members have say that they have do their own survey where funnily enough they get the result they hope to get in the most recent poll of people say that they support solar and that figure have never dip below there be question about balance as have say in this house on number of occasion and will say again we want to build clean power system that bring community with we that require balance of different technology in different part of the country but it be not credible to come here and say we support the building of structure but please do not build it in my constituency rise will briefly give way to the hon member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont be grateful to the minister but what be he say to my constituent who be genuinely terrify by these large scale wind farm pylon and solar farm come to our area of scotland which be sure he know well just as importantly what do he say to the hon member for rother valley jake richards and for south west norfolk terry jermy who raise the same concern as member on the opposition benches first say to the hon member that have one of europe large wind farm on my doorstep so know exactly what it be like would also say that bring down bill and deliver energy security matter to his constituent as much as it matter to mine and robust planning system be in place opposition members speak as though there be no process for local community to be consult but there absolutely be they be frequently consult and that play critical part in the decision make about these project will the minister give way will not because be conscious that there be another debate to come these question about the planning system be important there be rigorous process in place we recently raise the threshold for solar project go into the nsip regime seem to remember number of opposition members oppose that but the whole purpose be to ensure we do not have the issue that we have at the moment where lot of project be deliberately mw which be just below the threshold by change the threshold we have more project go through local democratic council planning consideration so those member should welcome that decision those planning decision also consider biodiversity the local economy visual amenity protect landscape and many other thing and those consideration also include as number of member say cumulative impact where more than one project be plan in close proximity member raise many other point that be afraid will not have time to come to in this debate so perhaps we should have another debate on some of they on land use the guidance make it clear that wherever possible developer should utilise brownfield industrial contaminate or previously develop land where development on agricultural land be necessary low quality land should be prefer to high quality land and so on on question of food security defer to the president of the national farmers union who say that it be important that we not sensationalist about the impact on food security trust his judgment on this question above some other in this place be move through number of point as quickly as can on land use number of member have ask about how we bring together the land use framework and the strategic spatial energy plan have meeting about that just this week the government should have have serious look at land use in this country many year ago and at how we strategically plan our energy system right across the country they will come together we be also look at regional energy plan that give more localise view too the national energy system operator be currently take that work forward and that be an important step on community involvement it be important that community feel like they have voice in this process have frequently say from this dispatch box that do not for second underestimate the strength of feeling for community that have any infrastructure build near their house or village whether that be prison the electricity system or new housing but as country we can not simply say that we will not build any new infrastructure because some people might oppose it if we do that we would never build anything we would never deliver economic growth and we would hold this country back so make no apology for say it be about the balance between how we bring community with we and how we get on with building in this country again and that be important on the point make by the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham about glint and glare the impact on the loop the loop be one of my highlight of the debate as the hon member for west dorset edward morello say solar panel be design to absorb light not reflect it and glint and glare be consider in the planning process already so it be take into account be conscious of the time and apologise to hon member who raise serious point that will not be able to address in this debate be happy to follow up in writing on number of those point solar power be one of the cheap form of energy that we have in this country it be deployable at scale and can play critical role in deliver our energy security and in our deliver the climate leadership that we need to tackle not future threat but present reality that will affect farmer up and down the country if we do not do so acknowledge that any infrastructure project have impact on community the planning system do all that it can to mitigate those impact but we need to build stuff in this country infrastructure have to be build and our electricity system have to be upgrade we will build on rooftop we will build mix of energy technology right across the country and we will take on all innovation that be possible it be fantastic how quickly we be innovate in this space but hon member can not simply say let not build in my constituency because that be not credible option thank the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham once again for secure the debate although we might not agree on everything take her point very seriously it be important for to say that hear the point that she and other have raise and be happy to meet she to discuss they far dr caroline johnson have one minute to wind up thank you madam deputy speaker hope the minister have listen carefully to what have be say and have understand that this be not about nimbys it be not about not in my back yard and it be not even about the aesthetic of solar farm it be about the overwhelming scale of the proposal and the fact that solar farm will take up huge amount of good quality farmland if one have sensible strategy and want to use ground mount solar one would put it in place where there be not good food produce land one would not put it on the good food produce land but that be what this government be seek to do question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider solar farm on point of order madam deputy speaker the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson refer to the heckington fen solar project in her speech today and claim that it be approve by the secretary of state the secretary of state do not take that decision he recuse himself from it and that be make abundantly clear publicly follow the decision we have duty in this house to be accurate and not to question another member integrity what the hon member say be categorically incorrect and therefore respectfully ask that she withdraw her comment thank the hon member for his point he will know that it be not point of order but point of debate that perhaps would have be well deal with in the debate itself by mean of an intervention however if the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson wish to respond she may far to that point of order madam deputy speaker my point be that under labour government and secretary of state labour donor have be give permission to build great big solar farm just outside my constituency that be the point be make the labour order we be not go to have continuation of the debate via point of order far to that point of order madam deputy speaker in the interest of accuracy understand that be what we be try to pursue the minister say during the course of his final remark that of power be produce by solar panel the figure for april produce by neso be thank the right hon member for his point of order as say these be point of debate not point of order and they be certainly not matter for the chair youth services beg to move that this house have consider the long term funding of youth service thank the backbench business committee for allow time for this debate member for support it and all the organisation that have provide material for today contribution this government have state that they be on mission to break down barrier to opportunity to ensure that every young person in every part of our country get the good start in life and have access to the tool they need to thrive as have always be the case young person be shape not just by what they do in classroom or what they hear in the playground but by the community they grow up in and the stake they have in it that be what youth service be they be safe space outside school and the place to broaden horizon and build meaningful connection with the outside world as an eld millennial with baby boomer parent know that every generation believe that theirs have have it the hard but in our day we at least have the luxury of live our most awkward and vulnerable year without the glare of social medium at least we have the opportunity to fail to be odd and to learn who we be before we present ourselves to the world whether it be the impact of covid the cost of live crisis or try to prepare for world of work that be constantly change our young people be face unprecedented challenge in country that for too long have not invest enough in their wellbeing as result in england one in five child and young people now have probable mental health disorder the number of emergency hospital admission for child age five to due to mental health crisis increase by between and incident of youth violence remain at high level with knife crime offence last year involve child the office for national statistics report that to year old be now the loneliest group in our society and the good childhood report state that the uk child and young people be the unhappy in europe this damn picture of what it be like to grow up in this country should shame we all because as they say it take village to raise child what have happen since the spending review which see funding for youth service pit against service with great statutory protection be the systematic dismantling of the network of support that use to keep our young people safe the village have be replace by patchwork of voluntary organisation with few and few council run youth service bid endlessly for one off pot of funding that will inevitably come to an end my hon friend be make powerful case she point out the extraordinary cut in the funding for youth service over under the last government with of centre lose can take this opportunity to say that some centre have thrive and that continue such as the sulgrave youth club which have its centenary next year and that be thank to long term support and funding but also to private philanthropy order the hon gentleman be an experienced enough parliamentarian to know that that be very long intervention my hon friend be quite right there have be decline in funding for youth service congratulate the organisation in his constituency on its centenary do my hon friend also recognise that there be also funding crisis in scotland with the scottish government starve local authority of the funding they need to provide these vital service this be not just in england it be uk wide problem and the snp scottish government be certainly not make it easy understand that msp colleague be consider bring in youth act in scotland which be quite innovative and perhaps we should try to emulate some of its provision with the closure of over youth centre one in eight local council now have no youth centre in its area the workforce crisis have see youth worker often stick in low pay and insecure work the voluntary sector which now deliver of youth work face its own funding crisis with of voluntary youth organisation have less than six month of cash reserve despite those challenge organisation across our community be step up to rebuild the village around our young people nowhere be that more evident than in croydon the town have the privilege of represent in this place in croydon organisation be work tirelessly to provide the support that young people need redthread which be work in croydon university hospital to offer young people catch up in youth violence way out reach higher which aim to support and champion young people across school community and home croydon drop in which offer free confidential advice and mental health support to young people and family and croydon youth consortium which be drive collaboration across local youth charity so they avoid compete against each other for the same limited pot of funding croydon be lead the way in give our young people stake in their community however due to impend budget cut and reorganisation croydon which be london young borough be on the verge of lose its council run youth engagement team the team provide critical link between the council the voluntary sector and vulnerable young people across the borough it provide outreach run youth hub in hard to reach area and oversee croydon youth assembly to put it simply croydon youth engagement team have save life the limited statutory protection in place for council lead youth service mean that croydon council can shut the service down without run proper consultation without ask key partner such as the police or the nhs how much they rely on the frontline knowledge the team offer they and even without consult the borough young people properly have approach only of they in the process of draw up its plan the council claim that some of the service will be retain by invite the voluntary sector to put in bid to run they but they can not replace the consistency institutional knowledge and co ordinating role that the youth engagement team provide as one mother whose son attend the new addington youth hub in my constituency put it the staff do such good job at make everything seem conversational and natural we ve have pop up service through charity but with the youth club they ve be able to spend time with consistent staff team and build relationship with professional and diverse staff welcome the government commitment to the wellbeing of our young people their work on national youth strategy that put the voice of young people at its heart and their plan for the young future hub to tackle the complex cause of youth violence but urge they to back up that investment with proper statutory protection for youth service it be time to stop the erosion of youth work it be time to introduce statutory sufficiency benchmark to ensure that no matter where they be no matter the community they grow up in all young people have the right to youth work with measurable minimum expectation as outline by the national youth agency that would not only give youth service the priority they deserve but provide stability to the youth work sector give it the long term structure need to invest in proper pay training and support for its workforce it be not just moral mission to provide these service for our young people it be also practical one as the government own data show young people who receive youth work support as teenager be happy healthy and wealthy as the institute for fiscal studies estimate for every invest in youth service we save between and in wide cost to society for many youth work provide trusted adult guide hand on to the next step when the next step feel impossible would like to end by share the story of rania she be young woman who like many across our country leave education full of potential but be paralyse by fear she battle deep mental health struggle loneliness isolation and crush sense that she be not enough for the work world rania get in touch with the king trust she begin to work with charlie youth delivery lead who do not just help she with her cv and job application she listen she believe and she walk she through every moment of doubt rania go on to apply for three nhs role and be offer all of they she be now proudly work as band healthcare assistant as she put it with the support provide hardly recognise myself still can hardly grasp how much charlie support have impact and motivate to achieve my goal that be the power of youth work at time when hundred of thousand of young people be struggle to find future it be youth worker like charlie who be quietly pull life back from the brink if we be serious about end the youth unemployment crisis if we be serious about the future of our young people and if we be serious about break down barrier to opportunity then we must get serious about the long term funding of our youth service rise member will be able to see quite how many be expect to speak this afternoon so be introduce three minute time limit immediately young people in devon have incredible potential across our whole county we see their creativity resilience and ambition we be lucky to have dedicated network of organisation and volunteer who support they every week from youth worker to counsellor community leader and peer mentor people across devon be step up to help our young people to get new opportunity in sidmouth for example the ymca play big role in the local community it host election husting last summer before the july election and the people who come to those husting from across east devon ask some really fantastic search question sadly with the demise of the manstone youth centre sidmouth have see the excellent work carry out by that centre either fold or at least move elsewhere in the town the closure of this youth centre be symptomatic of the demise of youth service that we have see over the past year do the hon gentleman agree that the fact that the conservative benches be empty reflect the conscious choice they make to underfund youth service which be why many of we find our youth service in this position the hon gentleman be absolutely right devon county council be run by the conservatives from to over which time we see staggering real term cut to youth service despite that we have some really dedicate volunteer who be do their very good with very limited mean in cullompton the john tallack youth and community centre offer weekly youth club session through involve mid devon provide space for young people to connect be hear and develop together with the share prosperity fund we have see that it be also possible to serve young people on the cusp of adulthood we have youth and adult employment hub include those at cullompton library and honiton beehive community centre which through the share prosperity fund provide one to one advice for people age and over to help they gain confidence develop skill and find employment or further training at least that be what we have until march when the share prosperity fund run out we be now very concerned about fund for youth service in devon devon county council spend just per young person which mean that the county rank out of local authority for spend per person accord to the totnes times more than child and young people in devon be currently wait for mental health support make early this sort of investment can alleviate concern downstream and indeed can actually save the state money spend on other service later on this be demonstrate in academic study with review of evidence from academic study find that youth work produce social return on investment of up to for every spend urge we to build on what be already work and expand the brilliant example that we have across devon but we need to do this through long term sustainable funding we need to join up youth service with mental health and education provision and create more integrated co ordinate approach enable our young people to get the help and support they deserve thank my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons for secure this important debate the long term funding of youth service be not just an issue of public spending we be talk about an investment in the next generation and in build future in which all young people can thrive as colleague have say we face mental health crisis accord to recent nhs datum one in five child now have probable mental health condition be really sadden to read the late unicef datum which place the uk near the bottom of the league table of high income country for the wellbeing of child and the happiness of teenager the uk rank out of on child mental health and british teenager be joint second from last for overall happiness the economic consequence be stark too accord to the government keep britain work report young people with mental health condition be nearly five time more likely to be economically inactive since there have be surge in the number of young people with work limit health condition to million and more than half million of those case come down to poor mental health although there have be welcome progress from this government they have launch the national youth strategy commit to ensure more mental health support team in school and increase investment in early intervention the pressure on young people continue to grow young people face challenge that be never encounter by previous generation include the impact of smartphone and social medium which bring increase social pressure however over the past decade local service have be decimate they have lose more than billion since in my constituency recently meet tahlia who attend one of my surgery to talk about the lack of support for her child with special educational need and the lack of youth service in our community rather than wait for action tahlia take it upon herself to connect with organisation to explore how good to support the youth of horsforth she be work with other to transform derelict building into community hub for young people with focus on support neurodiverse need that be powerful example not only of community leadership but of unmet need would like we to do more to support meaningful local consultation we should bring together young people parent school and community group to ensure that long term funding be target at youth service where they be need most the investment should align with the government goal of improve mental health support in school not as stand alone fix but as broad part of our strategy my question for the minister be how can we well support community wide wraparound service ensure direct funding and bring together school parent youth worker and local organisation to meet that need what further step can we take to limit the negative impact of smartphone and social medium on young people mental health beyond support the ban on phone in school and raise the digital age of consent if we want prosperous and productive future the most powerful investment that we can make be in the opportunity wellbeing and potential of our young people today the simple truth be that the money we invest in our youth service and young people today will save hundred of million of pound tomorrow more than that it will save life future and entire community across leicester south we be proud to have incredible grassroots youth organisation change life pedestrian allow child with special educational need and disability to express themselves and build confidence through youth music session it even help they to feature in exhibition shubaan youth project be beacon in the highfields area of the city offer safe space sense of connection and even football club the eyres monsell club for young people stand tall mentor support and empower the next generation those example be all too rare too many young people have nowhere to go and no one to turn to as the hon member for leeds north west katie white say today we learn of the alarming statistic publish by unicef that the uk rank out of in the happiness and wellbee league for child that be simply unacceptable for one of the rich nation in the world in the past year local authority spending on youth service in england have be slash by billion in real term that be cut as provision shrink violence rise in area where youth club have close people age to be more likely to commit crime why because if we do not offer they real role model as we use to in youth club they will find toxic one on social medium when there be no safe space isolation take root mental health decline physical health follow and hope disappear youth work be lifeline government fund research show that young people who access youth work be not just happy but healthy investment in it be smart economic because for every invest in youth work the social return be anywhere between and youth work save we more than million year in cost from knife crime antisocial behaviour and criminal justice this be not spend it be save but this robust sector be under threat funding be short term insecure and skew towards building rather than people but building alone do not change life youth worker do yet more than youth worker have leave the sector in the last decade third of those who remain be on zero hour or temporary contract earn an average of just year far below the uk average there be several action we can take first we could have national youth strategy with long term measurable plan to protect and strengthen youth service secondly we could have dedicated youth minister in cabinet to ensure that youth be not an afterthought but priority across all government agenda thirdly we could have long term youth workforce strategy to recruit retain and properly pay the skilled professional our young people rely on finally we should have ringfence sustainable revenue funding not just capital investment for open access youth service in every postcode when we talk about youth service we be really talk about the kind of country we want to be we often discuss crime prevention education and mental health in silos but the thread that run through all those issue be clear we need to invest in our young people through properly fund long term youth service scotland have proud tradition in youth work in my constituency youth work take many form from council programme to community lead project in our town and village in every case the service work to address inequality isolation and opportunity gap let highlight two example the callander youth project have turn former hotel into thrive hostel and social enterprise and offer employability programme and training opportunity to young people in bannockburn the eastern villages sport hub deliver sport and community activity in partnership with milton football club bannockburn rugby club and st modans cricket club that show how sport youth work and community development can go hand in hand those be fantastic example of grassroots ambition but behind the energy and creativity lie deep sense of fragility too many project rely on patchwork of short term funding want to recognise the role of organisation such as the national lottery community fund and many other that have step in to keep service run my hon friend be make passionate speech and be show why scotland produce some of the great footballer of all time like billy bremner he mention the short term funding of youth project my experience from my work with young carer be that part of the issue be that new project need to be fund do my hon friend agree that we need long term funding for not just exist project but new one too entirely agree with my hon friend and thank he for recognise billy bremner very good stirling man as be say many project rely on patchwork of short term funding but that reliance point to deep problem the retreat of local government especially under the snp government in holyrood who have deliver real term cut of over to core budget for local authority that make it near impossible to deliver on statutory obligation let alone expand service for the future when youth service be cut the impact be not abstract we see it in worsen mental health rise youth crime and lose opportunity we know what work youth service build confidence boost attainment improve wellbee and support employability and those be generational investment not optional extras that be why welcome the uk labour government commitment to embed youth service alongside mental health and career support in community however westminster action only go so far when holyrood be pull in the opposite direction if the snp be serious about equity and opportunity it must properly fund council and commit to long term support for youth service this be not just about budget it be about hope and act on our belief in the potential of every young person as mother of four bear devonians know that my constituency be wonderful place to grow up it embody the good of england green and pleasant land it be also home to vibrant network of youth circle pay tribute to the fantastic sport club big and small across the patch the strong presence of the young farmer club and to the cadet branch of our armed service in minehead uffculme doniford though they meet in watchet and tiverton also pay tribute to the myriad scout and guide troop across my constituency and the king award win exmoor young voices whom very much look forward to welcome to parliament next week apologise if have leave anybody out in an age when screen be increasingly fixture in daily life for the young generation the chance to spend time in the countryside be become all the more important it boost mental health encourage exploration and lay the foundation for lifelong appreciation of our natural environment sometimes wonder whether the great youth service in my constituency be the natural environment be keen to ensure that young people appreciate nature ground force however opportunity sometimes lie elsewhere for isolated and distant community that be direct result of the underfunding of youth service short change of future generation be shocked but not entirely surprised when see the figure for which indicate that somerset fund youth service for to year old to the tune of only per young person compare that to hull which provide per to year old if only the conservatives have not run somerset into the ground and underfunde local government across the country finally as we consider the future of youth service we can not ignore the benefit of adopt an eu youth mobility scheme this initiative would allow young people in the uk great access to work placement study exchange and cultural experience in europe it would broaden horizon and foster international co operation give our youth the ability to explore grow and develop skill beyond our border be not just beneficial to they it strengthen our economy and enrich our society surely that scheme would represent one of the great service to the young people of tiverton and minehead either we get serious about the issue face our youth service or we fail to tackle they head on and risk lose what we have which would be detrimental to all thank my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons for secure this fantastic debate experience the youth work profession as young person through my local youth club and as member of the uk youth parliament in its early day so know first hand how important youth work be and how much of it have be cut due to austerity only last week go to see gravesham youth council which have be run for year an incredible achievement give what have be go on run session on the national youth strategy call deliver you consultation in the form of delivery service for young people in the spirit of food delivery present some ingredient first young people should be truly listen to engage on matter that affect they and empower through youth voice mechanism at each level of government in that they should be support by youth work there should be legal duty on government and local government to support youth work secondly we need long term fully fund preventive universal open access youth work in all area not an early help or social work lite model although those can be use for target help thirdly we need train qualified and invest in youth work profession in which qualification be recognise the term youth worker should be protect in the same way as the term doctor be or lawyer fourthly and finally we need in primary legislation duty on local authority to provide youth work so that it be never see as an easy cut again now that be delivery order that will truly nourish our young people across the land through statutory youth service act and long term workforce strategy we can address shortage and upskill youth worker so that they can deliver for young people hope the minister will agree that that would be step in the right direction we have listen as government to the vote at campaign twenty year ago be at the forefront of the campaign and at recent liaison committee hearing the prime minister and government commit to deliver vote at as part of our manifesto commitment there have be so many year of campaign on the issue and pay tribute to all the young people who have join in that effort we should welcome those who be join the campaign now and jump on the bandwagon at the last minute we need to reverse the trend and see good open access youth work return to gravesham and the country youth work work and hope that the national youth strategy will deliver the hope of so many young people thank the hon member for croydon east natasha irons for bring this important debate to the chamber today youth service be not luxury they be lifeline at their good they provide young people with safe place to go trust adult to talk to and opportunity to grow learn and thrive yet all across the country we be see those vital service hollow out stretch thin or shut down altogether want to share an example from my constituency sussex community development association or scda respected local social enterprise base in newhaven have recently have to take the painful decision to close its regular youth club session at newhaven youth centre that be not due to lack of demand far from it indeed some of the young people who use the service credit the youth worker with save their life like so many organisation scda be be squeeze by rise wage bill and the knock on effect of national insurance change it be now face an additional in cost from the increase in the minimum wage alone and staggering in ni contribution that be in total for not for profit organisation that support young people in one of the most deprived community in the south east of england furthermore because it be large non profit employer it do not even qualify for the employment allowance that be mean to cushion the blow it be be penalise for do the right thing create real job and reinveste in our community scda be try to keep the flame alive by continue to support youth voice through the newhaven young people forum offer digital resource and make sure that newhaven youth centre remain youth hub however without secure long term funding scda and so many other will be constantly force to make impossible choice that story be not unique to newhaven in recent year more than billion have be cut from youth service across the uk accord to the ymca local authority spending on youth service have drop by more than we do not need another round of bidding war for limited fund instead we need proper long term settlement that recognise that invest in young people prevent future crisis in mental health crime education and employment it be not only the right thing to do morally it make economic sense too also urge ministers to review how change in employment policy from the national insurance threshold to minimum wage differential be impact voluntary and community organisation social enterprise such as scda should not be leave to bear disproportionate burden because they choose to create good permanent job if we be serious about give young people stake in their future we need to give youth service stake in ours we need not just warm word but funding that match the scale of their impact congratulate my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons on secure this important debate also want to take this opportunity to congratulate lead youth provider congratulate aspire in arts in nuneaton on its year anniversary from numerous conversation with the leader of the youth group amina know about the organisation struggle over the past year the success of its project be truly testament to the dedication of the staff it be true labour of love give that the ymca have estimate that warwickshire county council have cut staggering from our youth budget since it be amazing that aspire in arts have develop fantastic local asset that provide support for hundred of young people it add value to our young people life with art game cooking and health provision and education the music provision be incredible and be about to get even well as performance space and recording studio be establish the organisation be build the capital culture and creative industry talent that we need for the future while truly enhance life and broaden horizon crucially aspire in arts provide safety net an open door and safe place for young people who have nowhere else to go those who need support and those at risk of bullying harassment and exploitation it also give positive choice to those at risk of enter into criminality indeed we already know that youth provision reduce the rate of youth reoffende by and reduce the severity of the crime the positive impact of youth service transform life and map out pathway to embrace passion and nurture talent support young people to learn the skill that they need to live successful life in the future in nuneaton more than of our young people be economically inactive youth crime antisocial behaviour and youth violence be enormous issue that have result in tragic outcome in recent week aspire have be hold the frontline support these young people through unmet mental health and send need and provide alternative provision when the barrier to attend school be just too great be wait for an opportunity to mention young carer who be hugely important part of the great picture of young people and who often face many barrier to education do my hon friend agree that any consultation with young people should include young carer as have my consultation in harlow absolutely it be clear from interaction with young carer and parent of child who be not in school that the gratitude for youth service and the value they add be immense the casework story from youth provision in nuneaton be often harrowing young people in crisis and on the edge of suicide self harm and mental health episode and victim of violence and abuse the open door policy mean that we have safety net to catch and support they the net that the organisation provide save life help they rebuild and offer support for bright future evidence suggest that invest in youth provision result in to for the taxpayer but think the value it add be incalculable especially when we consider the impact on other service such as health education policing and justice aspire in arts work collaboratively with other youth group to provide service across the north of warwickshire and to establish ambitious inspire plan to support our young people it would like to do more and with secure funding instead of piecemeal day to day hand to mouth funding it would be able to secure place for young people across nuneaton and to support everyone congratulate my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons on secure this timely and essential debate know she be champion of not just young people but local government and her speech eloquently demonstrate the urgent need for action to build fit for purpose youth service rather like star wars my youth feel long time ago in galaxy far far away but be one of those young people live in village that benefit hugely from the presence of brick and mortar youth centre staff by highly skilled youth worker profession that have be demonstrably under appreciated and wrongly devalue for the past decade and half as young man the centre not just give secure space to play game learn skill and socialise but thank to the support worker give support through challenging time in my life we do not talk in such term then but it be accessible and non judgmental mental health support available on my doorstep something not available to my redditch and village constituent now perversely as the internet social medium and youtube influencer have emerge with the challenge that that have pose to our young people we have witness the dismantling of our youth service if we combine that with the impact of the cost of live crisis and we can not ignore the fact that our young people face far more challenge than we do grow up as parish district and county councillor albeit one of the young one have witness how local government cut have decimate our youth service my hon friend be make passionate speech about the importance of youth centre provision do he agree that the conservatives dismantle of oxfordshire county council youth service by close of the youth centre that exist prior to do irreparable damage to young people in oxfordshire every council that serve on be also conservative and they decimate our youth service it be real shame to see the conservative benches empty today be grateful for the fact that the government have listen to the voice of young people and launch the national youth strategy but let we not be under any illusion there be lot of work to do the benefit of youth service and youth work be painfully obvious and fit perfectly into this government mission of economic growth safe street an nhs fit for the future and break down barrier to opportunity have speak many time in this chamber about mental health especially raise concern about young people fit for purpose and accessible youth service could make significant progress in address these grow challenge we can give young people space and the support they need in their community to drown out the voice of misogynistic influence which be poison our young man mind and put our sister and daughter at risk it can be place for education and aspiration that protect our young people from the nefarious actor promote violence and crime let we be bold and decide to invest appropriately in our youth service for the long term let we replace the opaque statutory minimum with specific investment minimum ensure accessibility for all young people include those with neurodivergence challenge and set great standard for those deliver service in order to protect the youth worker profession surely there can be no great or more important investment in our nation that an investment in the next generation rise be keen to get everybody in so will have to reduce the speak limit to two minute thank my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons for secure this critical debate youth service be integral to enable young people to live safe healthy and happy life but we can not deny that issue and policy relate to child and young people often get push aside we must recognise the contribution that they make and will make to our society by ensure that they have access to youth service be so pleased to hear the government announcement early this year on develop new national youth strategy just last week hold strategy session in my ribble valley constituency and hear from the fantastic bowland high school council about what young people in my area need and want it be chance to hear they talk openly about their concern be take aback by the number of student who discuss the stress worry and pressure that they feel particularly in relation to their exam wish all those start their gcse this week good luck that emphasise the need for youth service to support young people through these big life stage they also discuss the lack of place to go where they could feel truly safe youth provision be personal for have be member and volunteer of girlguiding since start brownies when be seven and serve on the girlguiding national board for six year so have see at first hand the impact that such youth movement can have on young people would like to think that my confidence and self belief as stand in this house today come from that provision that be the power that good youth service have highlight to the government how powerful investment can be when it follow exist infrastructure and good practice many organisation such as guide and scout have exist for over century but they be reliant on volunteering and modern lifestyle can not sustain that the framework that those organisation have develop be cut edge however so welcome build on those provision one young woman speak to recently say that the private stage school she have enjoy prove too expensive for she in the long run would love it if we subsidise great local youth offer where possible rather than reinvent the wheel do so would also support local business we must ensure that youth provision be extend to our rural community and can be access across the country would echo my order call warinder juss some of young people who have attend youth centre say that it have make positive difference to their life they have come away happy healthy and more confident in themselves and their future from reduce level of knife crime and antisocial behaviour to improve the education

for nearly year but have fail to deliver beyond isolated example welcome as they be include in glasgow and national fair funding pilot after year this should be the approach across the whole sector year to year funding be barrier to recruitment and retention of staff and their ability to build the trust and familiarity that be so vital to the young people they support if we be to achieve fairer

the country include in my county of norfolk it be rewarding job but it come with many challenge and frustration youth work have bear the brunt of many cut and in too many place service be now shadow of their former self under the previous government there be real term cut of more than billion in spending on youth service among local authority in england so no wonder more than of all council run youth centre close watch in disbelief in norfolk as our conservative control county council entirely scrap the county youth service include important detach youth work and close the connexion training and career advice service fill that void in many place be charity include the swan youth project in downham market in my constituency which have visit on number of occasion it provide whole system

labour government we be meet the challenge head on thank my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons for secure the debate far be it from to come to the chamber and speak only about myself but want to share my personal experience have often say that have it not be for the youth worker in my community would not be stand here as the member of parliament for hertford and stortford drop out of sixth form at and go straight to work in hertford town centre want to find my path but be leave feel directionless struggle to connect with the right opportunity can not put into word the difference that the support of local authority youth worker like russell who have mention in the chamber before make to as young person who could not see the way forward young person in the same position today will not have access to similar level why be that it be not because our youth worker be any less passionate or determined to support our young people no it be because when the cut come under the last government youth service be first on the chop block leave generation of young people behind in hertfordshire there have be real term cut to youth service spending since one in eight young people be not in employment education or training they be at the sharp end of crisis in mental health and in provision for child with special educational need and disability with charity and voluntary organisation strain every sinew to fill the gap and ensure that our young people do not miss out that be the legacy of the conservative party when it come to young people and it be real disappointment to see conservative benches so empty this afternoon in my remain time would like to pay tribute to the thirst youth café and the futurehope group charity and voluntary organisation that have provide fantastic support in our community it be pleasure to visit they when we be host consultation in my constituency on the national youth strategy hugely welcome the work that this government be undertake to support our young people and hope to play role in that as math teacher former councillor and dad of two wonderful child know the importance of youth provision we have hear from member from across the house that the cut in youth funding since have have devastating consequence in leeds that figure be leeds have manage to negate some of the consequence with excellent work through the child friendly leeds initiative and our youth service worker know how to squeeze their budget until the pip squeak they know how to stretch out their finance and deliver for young people in my area but they can only do so much as my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons say patchwork of organisation have come in to fill the gap there be many such organisation in leeds south west and morley that want to pay tribute to include volunteer lead sport team that have offer provision for young people such as wortley football club east ardsley cricket club and morley rugby club could go on also pay tribute to leeds united football club over the past few year have work with the club which have agree to purchase piece of land in my constituency that it be go to transform into wortley wembley it will provide training opportunity for young people and hub for so many in my community to come together and play sport we might find the next kalvin phillips who know hopefully this time he or she will stay at leeds would like the minister to consider several recom mendation on youth provision we need strong statutory protection as be reasonably practicable be the ultimate get out clause and local authority do not necessarily have to follow it so we must consider change that we need to increase funding the increase in funding be welcome we need to ensure that we tailor our service towards special educational need student and young people because they deserve youth provision too thank my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons fellow age millennial for secure this debate speak not only as parent who would love to see well fund youth service but as somebody who have witness the consequence of short term thinking when it come to youth service in conservative lead staffordshire county council take the callous and short sighted decision to close our youth service completely the complete emptiness of the opposition benches speak volume about whether the conservatives attitude to youth service have improve in the past year for they this be line on budget sheet but for community in my county it be the closure of youth club and the loss of job however the real cost of these decision lie not in number but in the experience of young people in my constituency the day to day impact of cut often go unnoticed but the long term impact be impossible to ignore as an antidote to the gloomy picture that may have paint will mention couple of the incredible organisation that despite the closure of our youth service be do incredible work the staffordshire council of voluntary youth services fondly know as scvys offer practical support to charity and local group and ensure that the voice of child and young people be hear the vysions youth service be create by child and young people in brereton and rugeley and provide range of programme and activity from shoot and fish to art and craft in some of our most deprived white working class community welcome the investment announce by the government but in closing urge the minister to ensure that that funding be front load in area such as staffordshire that have no council youth service leave whatsoever sympathise with colleague who represent inner city area and have see deep cut but ask they to imagine world in which their youth service no long exist at all that be the world that my constituent have live in for the past eleven year all of we here have the high hope for our young people and be incredibly glad that once again we have government that do too let we be frank this generation have be rob of the opportunity that it deserve let we think about the record of the last government because other have touch on it child trust fund be cut sure start centre be closed school budget be cut in real term play field be sell off and free swimming the education maintenance allowance and connexion be cut that be terrible the statistic that stand out to the most be the fact that youth service in county durham be cut by between and it be no wonder that one in eight young people be not in education employment or training that we have five year waiting list for camhs and that one in five people have mental health condition that have to change pay tribute to some of the excellent people and group in my constituency who step up such as the auckland youth and community centre lead by maxine jordan and her team those who run the scout the guide and church group that provide youth service and the parent who simply step up to fill gap however the truth be that that be not enough and we know that call on the government to get to grip with this issue know that this government have have terrible economic inheritance with high debt and tax and nothing to show for it in public service interruption think the shadow minister be point out that growth be up under this government this will take funding and legislative change on statutory duty because we can not allow this generation to be waste we owe it to this generation to keep the promise of britain that it will do well not bad than our generation have dedicated space support and community for young people can transform the trajectory of someone life and many member here be sure benefit from have youth provision take part in activity that would not have do otherwise the previous government strip funding away from local authority be travesty because it mean that youth service which be vital but mainly discretionary spend be often one of the first thing to be cut our child and adolescent mental health service be overstretch and too often young people have be leave to fall through the crack investment in youth service be therefore not an extra it be form of frontline mental health support the need for funding for youth service in derbyshire dales be particularly clear since spend on youth service in derbyshire have fall by two third in real term those cut have have particularly damaging implication for rural area as young people in rural community face limited public transport option and more challenging access to employment young people today be grow up experience the negative impact of social medium addiction alongside the loss of youth service as result they be experience toxic cocktail of challenge that be have an impact on their wellbeing yougov poll find that more than of adolescent say they have feel alone often or sometimes in the last fortnight with youth centre and community space be close across the country it be no wonder that young people be cry out for support since there have be fall of more than in the number of young people admit to with injury sustain outside of course that be good thing but it imply that young people be just not go out and participate activity as they use to youth service do not just provide lifeline for young people they also set they up with skill and support for life very often youth worker could be the one who turn around person life interruption be sorry madam deputy speaker have run out of time youth service across our country have be decimate and we all see the consequence unfold often tragically on our street since fund for youth service have fall by as direct result of austerity this issue be deeply personal to as grow up with youth club on my doorstep in ashmore park one of around local youth centre that we have lose over the past year the closure of that safe space leave real hole in the community one that be proud to serve year later as deputy headteacher despite that widespread loss there be still community effort that forge ahead such as the loft youth club at the hive in new invention that youth club be run by people who care deeply who know our community and who keep go often without the security of long term funding shin example city wide be the way youth zone the way offer more than just activity it offer friendship and opportunity and make memory it be power by passionate staff who believe in our youth think of my young constituent kira who find her safe space her voice and her confidence through the way through inclusive programme and nurture mentor kira have grow into an incredible young person who be determined to give back her story be one of many and it be testament to what be possible when we invest properly in our youth we must shift from crisis response to prevention which mean dedicated long term funding stream to protect youth service for many of our community youth service be lifeline they provide essential support to young people help they to navigate the complexity of adolescence and the transition into adulthood but unfortunately those service have disappear across the country the decline of youth service in town such as halesowen have not make headline but it be be feel every single day recently sit down with young people age between and school leaver and graduate some with master degree all full of ambition but struggle to find support these be young people who have work hard who have dream and aspiration and be eager to contribute to society yet they find themselves face barrier at every turn they tell that there be nowhere safe to go after school that mental health service take month to access and that they be send out cv after cv but get nothing back one young woman say it feel like we expect to survive not succeed in many way she be right in halesowen there be no council run youth centre that be not coincidence it be the result of political choice under conservative run dudley council over million have be cut from local service in the borough youth service be shut down entirely with youth worker redeploy outreach team cut and community asset sell off council document show service reduction and youth provision be the first to go we know that such cut have real world consequence the national youth agency have find that youth worker play critical role in prevent crime improve mental health and keep young people in education training or work when that support be take away the risk grow we see high rate of youth unemployment increase mental health issue and rise in antisocial behaviour the young people speak to be not ask for favour they be ask for fairness and government who have not give up on they they want to be see hear and support they want to know that their future matter we owe they well and it be time that we deliver thank hon member for work with we get all the back bench contribution in we now come to the front benchers call the liberal democrat spokesperson congratulate the hon member for croydon east natasha irons on secure this debate because youth service be critical infrastructure in our community they be not luxury or nice to have they be vital lifeline offer young people safety support and opportunity at the time they need it most there can be no doubt that we be perhaps more than ever before engage in battle for the heart and mind of young people there have be debate and panic in this place and throughout the nation for generation concern the challenge face young people but what be different in this moment be the sheer scale of the collapse in physical community space and as we be here to focus on youth service many great point have be raise already but will focus on the most egregious consequence of not protect and enhance youth service knife crime in the fight against knife crime in london these service be vital because knife crime be not only criminal justice issue but public health issue like any other public health crisis the solution lie in early intervention community base support and sustained investment that start with our youth service in the past year youth service across england have be cut by more than that be more than half of youth centre go thousand of train youth worker lose and community leave to pick up the piece research by the institute for fiscal studies show that when youth centre close young people age to become more likely to commit crime in area already battle poverty inequality and deprivation youth centre can mean the difference between safety and tragedy in london we see more than incident of knife crime last year that be thousand of family affect and life change forever we know that young people susceptible to commit this form of violence require sustained relationship with service that can help they choose safe path and that can offer child that vital third space when school be struggle to maintain learn environment and home be worryingly hostile place they be service that protect young people mental health in such troubling environment and it be fitting that we be have this debate in mental health awareness week perpetuate the situation by fail to boost local council finance whereby many council have no choice but to cut youth service be bad than termism it be failure to allow council and other key stakeholder in the community to do what they want to do invest in young people future and keep they away from crime in sutton and cheam have hear that many skilled youth worker be deter from work in these decline service and not just because they be not equipped to do their job properly but because the financial pressure mean short termism in grant from the mayor office for policing and crime and reliance on temporary contract we all know that local authority be under immense pressure many be on the brink and without proper funding from central government they simply can not deliver what our community need so that must come first but we liberal democrats be call for more first we be call for statutory duty on all local authority to provide youth service and pre charge diversion scheme for young people up to the age of right now access to youth diversion the very intervention that steer young people away from offend be postcode lottery that be utterly unacceptable by make it statutory duty we would ensure that every young person in every community can access support before it be too late not just after crime have be commit we also want to see national youth strategy that be co produce with young people themselves not cook up in whitehall without their voice if we be serious about solve the knife crime crisis we must treat young people not as risk to be manage but as partner in prevention with huge potential to be realise the public health approach demand early intervention but early intervention can not happen if youth service be simply not there any more call the shadow minister thank the hon member for croydon east natasha irons for secure this debate know that she have regularly champion this issue since come to this place as lord cameron famously say be the future once official report july vol although be no long view as one of the young member in this place be grateful for the opportunity on behalf of his majesty official opposition and in the limited time available to close today important debate on the long term funding of youth service this subject go to the heart of how we support the next generation to thrive contribute and belong and it be crucial to the future of our great country in government we allocate million over three year to the national youth guarantee which ensure that every young person in england age between and have regular access to club and activity something to do after school experience away from home and opportunity to volunteer as part of that we allocate million to youth facility improve and develop over of they my right hon friend the member for daventry stuart andrew always make sure that young people be around the table when we make decision that would affect they we make sure that young people be not just talk about but listen to and next week the shadow ministerial team will host youth roundtable as part of our wide policy renewal want to be clear that conservative members believe passionately in the power of civil society we believe in the social fabric that hold this country together not just the big institution of state but the small charity volunteer faith group sport coach and mentor who give their time not for profit but for purpose they include such organisation as the national citizen service which the labour government have cancel more than young people participate in that programme over year and it have satisfaction rate which be something that this government can only dream of we recognise the vital role of youth worker who be often unsung and under resource but who be always on the frontline we must be honest money alone will not solve all the challenge face young people cheque from whitehall however large will not guarantee that child find mentor stay off the street or get first step on the ladder however since come into office this government have make it more difficult for every single charity in this country to provide their essential service the hon member for lewes james maccleary recognise that in his speech and he be the only member who speak about the national insurance hike as you will know madam deputy speaker and as the chancellor know when she make her decision youth charity like all employer pay national insurance contribution and they need to find additional fund to cover the rise in those contribution accord to the national council for voluntary organisations the change could cost the charity sector an additional billion per year for small charity with limited reserve and limited core funding that will seem like an insurmountable challenge yesterday we hear from representative of lead child mental health charity that have provide expert school base mental health support over the past year they tell we that thank to this labour government national insurance hike they now have to find an extra half million pound every single year just to pay tax as direct result of this government decision it be likely that few child will receive the care and support that they need in an environment that be familiar to they that be why we support exempt charity with an annual income of less than million from the national insurance rise however labour members cruelly vote against that and they must reflect on that now that they be in government they be in control when the conservatives be in government we do not just talk about aspiration we build the condition for it we empower local community and launch countrywide programme such as the national citizen service which have prove track record of success before this government close it down the labour government be dismantle the ncs in do so they be actively and deliberately limit the life chance of this generation and generation to come without give we any answer on what come next hope that this government will start to think properly about young people instead of make young people live more difficult the government should put they at the heart of policymake and should reverse their callous tax on charity youth organisation and business which will likely mean rise in youth unemployment this year it be time for action not word congratulate my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons on secure this important debate on long term investment in the youth sector follow similar debate in westminster hall few month ago be grateful to all member who contribute to this debate the shadow minister perhaps do not read the room again although it be rather empty on his side of the house will address some of his point later want to make it clear that this government value youth service we know that they can play vital role in young people life support their health wellbee and personal development we also know that the support that youth service provide be under pressure since local council have reduce spending on youth service by that be equal to the sector lose over billion that have mean few job less co ordination and too many young people miss out on the benefit of high quality youth service we be of course navigate challenging financial period but even in tough time our commitment to find long term sustainable way of deliver effective support remain the same my hon friend the member for croydon east open the debate by paint very powerful picture she speak about have the freedom to fail and speak as someone who grow up just before social medium really appreciate that point perhaps in the word of my hon friend the member for cannock chase josh newbury that make an age millennial be not sure how feel about that my hon friend the member for croydon east also speak about the huge mental health challenge about one in five young people have mental health condition and about to year old be the lonely people in society my hon friend the member for redditch chris bloore echo that and this be of course mental health awareness week recognise the point that my hon friend the member for croydon east make about opportunity exist everywhere but too often support be postcode lottery and we want to change that as this debate have highlight young people face increasingly complex challenge from mental ill health and the cost of live to worry about crime and violence the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor make that point powerfully support young people and ensure that their voice be hear be challenge not just for national government but at every level of government strong local leadership be of course essential to deliver high quality youth service that be why in the come week we will launch the local youth transformation pilot work with approximately local authority and their partner across england the pilot will support council to take leading role in plan and provide youth service that meet the need of their community it will offer tailor support to rebuild local capability improve co ordination and ensure that service be align with council responsibility and young people wellbee many hon member have mention example from their constituency include my hon friend the members for ribble valley maya ellis for stirling and strathallan chris kane for glenrothes and mid fife richard baker for derby south baggy shanker for hertford and stortford josh dean and for halesowen alex ballinger my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss speak very powerfully and be pleased to visit the way youth zone with he last year my hon friend the member for huddersfield harpreet uppal give an impressive list of group in her constituency and know she be really passionate about this subject as she lead recent westminster hall debate on similar topic hear members speech but as have not respond to all of they individually be happy to meet or write to they will the minister give way in the interest of time will not as the member of parliament for barnsley south know from my area about the huge contribution and value that youth service and provision bring be think of organisation such as the barnsley youth choir through which hundred of young people be give amazing experience opportunity and skill over the last couple of month have meet the barnsley youth council the barnsley ymca and chileypep to hear their idea for how the government can support young people those conversation have make it clear that we need long term national direction that be why we be develop new year national youth strategy which will set out clear vision for support young people now and in the future the strategy will guide work across government departments and it will help make sure that policy and service that affect young people be well join up it will also move we away from one size fit all approach we know that what work in one area may not work in another and the strategy will support flexible solution that reflect local need that important point about join up service be also make by my hon friend the member for leeds north west katie white we be co produce the strategy with young people their voice be shape the priority and the outcome we want to put more power in the hand of young people and their community my hon friend the member for gravesham dr sullivan speak about the power and role of the youth voice over young people fill in our survey as part of our youth strategy work so assure the shadow minister that we be put young people at the heart of our approach long term approach be essential young people deserve consistent support now and over the next decade of course youth worker both pay and voluntary be central to deliver that support they build trust relationship strengthen community and provide the vital support that young people rely on however after year of cut the workforce be under pressure and secure role be hard to find as we develop the national youth strategy we be focus on rebuild the workforce through well training recruitment and long term support this be our chance to ensure that youth worker and volunteer be equip support and recognise for the important work that they do my hon friend the member for south west norfolk terry jermy speak powerfully from his experience in partnership with the national youth agency we be help more people especially those from under represent background to gain recognise qualification it be clear that youth service need stable long term funding to thrive today the secretary of state have announce our funding plan for this financial year direct hon member to her write ministerial statement for further detail but would highlight the million that we will put into programme that help young people to grow gain confidence and feel connected that funding will expand access to trust group such as the duke of edinburgh award scheme and uniformed youth go towards explore and outdoor learning opportunity and boost open access to local youth service the hon member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour speak about the huge benefit of be outside over million in capital funding be be allocate to the well youth space programme include million in new funding to renovate and equip youth centre across the country that of course build on the work be do through the youth investment fund the future of government funding beyond this financial year will be shape by our work on the national youth strategy and dependent on spend review outcome we want the funding to be as impactful as possible which be why we be look at what young people need most in addition to government funding million from the dormant asset scheme be be invest in youth outcome between and all the measure that have outline from strengthen the workforce to create safe space and develop long term national youth strategy reflect this government commitment to young people the work of my department will allow the development of the young future hub the youth guarantee and the curriculum review to name just few initiative we be commit to work across government for our young people we owe it to this generation to keep strive for system that be there when they need it not just now but in the future thank the minister for her response it be amazing to hear about the extra funding go in and the government approach to ensure long term sustainable future for our youth service it be different approach from that take by the previous government who rip apart that network give the theme of today debate and the piecemeal patchwork approach take by the previous government it be great for we all that this government be take such different approach pay tribute to member from across the house although obviously not those on the conservative benches because they could not be bother to turn up will not name everybody individually because think we have over contribution but would like to highlight some of the key theme that come up include the need for long term strategy which the minister speak about and the need for statutory back up none of we want repeat of previous year and the mistake of the previous government who take away support and the cover that youth service provide we need to give they statutory back up the minister be put extra investment into this space urge she to really back up these service with the statutory protection that they deserve will end with an african proverb if child be not embrace by the village it will burn it down to feel its warmth if we do not learn the lesson of the past we will continue to see the mental health of our young people decline and their experience will continue to be the unhappy in europe no one who attend today debate want that to continue so let we learn the lesson and have long term sustainable funding for our youth service very touching question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the long term funding of youth service coroner services west midlands motion make and question propose that this house do now jones be extremely grateful for the opportunity to address an issue that continue to cause deep pain and disruption to our community across birmingham and the west midland and to speak about an under appreciated service that we will all turn to at some point in our life the amount of time that pass between death and burial be not matter of mere procedure or bureaucracy it be first and foremost matter of dignity faith and human decency so we must afford our coroner service the urgent and serious attention that they deserve for many the news of love one pass bring not only sorrow but an immediate sense of duty in both the muslim and jewish tradition burial can not be postpone without consequence it be religious imperative to bury the deceased as soon as possible ideally within hour that be fundamental and non negotiable feature of those faith when that process be delay not for hour but for day and sometimes week it cause deep wound these family be not just deal with loss but be keep in suspense both spiritually and emotionally unable to complete the final rite that bring the peace closure and healing that we all deserve when we lose love one what be bad be that these delay have become commonplace they be no long the exception increasingly they be the norm every week hear from grieve family in my constituency motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now jones every week hear from grieve family who be tired frustrated and often feel helpless their story be heartbreaking many do not know where to turn they call their councillor and their mp and they be right to do so when the system fail they it be our job to listen to act and to advocate rise on coroner service in the west midland call jim shannon speak to the hon member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan before the debate madam deputy speaker he and be in debate in westminster hall just this afternoon coroner service whether it be in the west midland or anywhere else in the united kingdom be an issue tell the hon gentleman what my intervention be go to be by the way and he okay it be happy to do so the hon gentleman may be aware that there be only three full time coroner in northern ireland with the historic legacy of the trouble take up time and the coroner step outside his remit do the hon gentleman not agree that in both his constituency and mine the need for the coroner must be focus on and that they should be available to those who need they most furthermore do he agree that there be need to increase the number of coroner in order to allow family to have the fact of the case when they need they to allow the healing to begin really appreciate the intervention from the hon gentleman who make poignant point the service do require modernisation in birmingham and solihull we have one senior coroner two area coroner and seven assistant coroner to look after population of approximately million accord to the census in comparison in the hon gentleman patch there be four coroner for million people which be simply not enough as say these family be not just deal with the loss of family member but be keep in suspense both spiritually and emotionally in may more than inquest in this country have be delay by more than year as the hon gentleman appreciate each of those inquest represent grieve family unable to find closure plan funeral or settle estate do he agree that this government should now act to clear the backlog and to provide extra funding this situation be nothing short of crisis thank the hon gentleman for his intervention be go to quote those figure in my speech he be absolutely right that those delay have direct impact on not just family who want closure but current case that need to be work on the time spend by the coroner on inquest will naturally impact the basic sign off of document in other case and where the coroner be not available to sign off family will have to wait to effect burial we need modernisation of course and seek support from the minister on how we can modernise the service as say hear of grieve family every week they be tired frustrated and often feel helpless and turn to elect representative for intervention want to share story from my constituency that highlight the human impact of these delay prominent brain surgeon have lose his father the funeral which should have take place within day be delay for over week due to coroner backlog that surgeon bind by faith and family duty remain in mourning and could not return to work until the burial have take place his father death be more than personal loss it have professional consequence too appointment be cancel and surgery be delay there be countless example of where family member and extend family member have to remain in mourning which mean that they be not able to do the work that they would ordinarily do thank my hon friend for give way and for his very powerful speech do he agree that any death be very stressful and distressing but when it be child everything become amplified child post mortem require specialist paediatric medical examiner and shortage of they in the east midland rather than in the west midland mean that body be sometimes take to other city and this be far stress and distressful for the family more paediatric medical examiner be require have not actually think about the loss of child but of course that must be extremely distressing especially if the family have to wait for child body to be send to another part of the country for examination to take place in raise this matter in the chamber today hope the minister will take on board the point that have make and understand why we believe that there be desperate need for modernisation which deal with the issue feel by community up and down this country let return to my personal experience patient be leave wait because the brain surgeon be unable to attend to they while he be still in mourning this be what happen when we allow systemic inefficiency to go unaddressed they begin to erode the very service on which we all rely and impose hidden cost that can not be measure but be there none the less this bring we to the heart of the issue what be cause these delay there be several factor at play here among they be the state of our coroner service quite frankly it be under resource understaffed and overstretch the people work in this sector be not to blame they be do incredible work under immense pressure but the system be in desperate need of transformation let we look at the fact across england and wales my hon friend be be very generous with his time would like to echo that fact leicester coroner service be do an excellent job one reason be that the community and any burial committee especially in the muslim burial council of leicester have create real relationship thereby override any misunderstanding and improve proficiency of course it be important that all community form bond with their local coroner but ultimately if the coroner and their staff be limit in number there be always go to be backlog and delay in process the very important work of identify the cause of death and then release the deceased let we look at the fact across england and wales more than coroner case be pende for more than year four time high than in birmingham and the west midland be among the worst affected our population be grow our community be increasingly diverse with more resident who require specific religious consideration yet the infrastructure have not keep pace the government funding commitment have not match rise everyday demand we do not have enough pathologist and we do not have enough administrative support we do not have the essential tool that could make significant difference tool such as mri and ct scan machine which be use for the sole purpose of conduct non invasive autopsy however we do have access to these facility but they be not dedicate to the coroner it be by take advantage of technological innovation such as those that we can make life easy for family whose faith prohibit invasive post mortem procedure with the right equipment we can respect those belief and still get the datum require by law another major issue be the absence of weekend service in most part of the country coroner office operate monday to friday but people do not stop die on fridays death occur every day when service close for the weekend death that occur on friday night may not be process until monday or even tuesday for family who be religiously obligate to bury their love one immediately the delay be deeply distress introduce weekend operation for coroner and burial service be not luxury but necessity in birmingham we do have coroner who would give up his time on weekend but that have stop to speak plainly about another area of concern mp be increasingly be tell not to contact coroner office on behalf of constituent we be tell that it constitute interference in fact that be set out in the code of conduct for parliamentarian reject that completely mp be not ask coroner to change their finding or try to influence investigation we be not question their professionalism or their judgment we be simply ask for speed efficiency and compassion to suggest that this be interference misunderstand both the role of an mp and the seriousness of the issue we must be allow to advocate for our constituent commend the hon gentleman for his wise word we be all of different faith whether christian or other faith and some people have no faith person religion must be paramount when it come to the coroner work and the coroner must ensure that burial can take place within the period of time that the person faith indicate would have think that be something that can not be ignore under human right and equality perhaps there be another way of look at that thank the hon member for his intervention there be significant case law that identify this specific need and coroner do abide by that and try their good to assist when expediency be require because of religion unfortunately it come back to the bottleneck where coroner want to do the good they can within the structure in which they be work but they be limit by resource that come down to issue such as staffing when family have nowhere to turn it should not be inappropriate for parliamentarian to contact the coroner to assist the suffering or grieve family will the minister please review the part of the code of conduct for parliamentarian that relate to communicate with coroner one way that we in dewsbury and batley try to overcome this restriction rule also could not understand be by work with our not for profit and charitable funeral service especially in religious community organisation such as fisabilillah and sadaqah jariyah build relationship with the coroner to try to facilitate communication with family who reach out to mps do the hon member agree that these organisation in community should be congratulate and thank for their service and that the communication channel he speak of should be formalise and make permissible agree wholeheartedly with the hon member up and down the country many organisation such as undertaker provide that support mechanism unfortunately from my personal experience this be certainly the case in birmingham and be confident it be in the west midland region too family first port of call be their local councillor or parliamentarian and there be an expectation from the community or the family that they will make representation to the coroner if elect representative be unable to have that communication because of the code of conduct our very function be undermine it be important that organisation maintain the relationship that they have with coroner but it be also important to give parliamentarian the ability to communicate with the coroner directly to ensure that the service meet the demand of their community they need additional funding coroner service require transformation but resource for that transformation be important that mean hire more pathologist be grateful to the hon member for allow to intervene again apart from he think be the only member from the west midland in the chamber my constituency be wolverhampton west do he agree that there appear to be postcode lottery as the time it take to process an inquest range from week to week depend on where person live if we do have postcode lottery do he agree that we must address that by have national performance framework for our coroner service and target funding for underperform area of course if there be disparity in the level of service receive there ought to be some mechanism for identify where that be occur and an understanding as to why if it be because of resource and manpower that must be address fully agree with the hon member analysis it be shame that we do not have other parliamentarian from the west midland in the chamber be confident that some will have receive an enormous amount of contact and huge number of call throughout their tenure as do one of the issue be resource include those mri and ct scan facility available for post mortem and dedicate to that purpose although our coroner in birmingham and solihull have access to those device unfortunately they be not dedicate to that task and deceased may lie in the coroner mortuary until facility become available which can take day and sometimes even long transformation also mean ensure that service operate not just five but seven day week because death grief and religious obligation do not adhere to the normal working week we also need to develop clear protocol across all local authority that recognise the need for expedite burial in line with religious belief there must be training awareness and sensitivity in coroner service as recently have the experience of bereavement in the family may ask the hon member to join in recognise the exceptional service of the blackburn coroner service and its vital contribution to our community can say confidently that the coroner have work with work tirelessly and often outside their work hour to deliver the good possible service but the limitation on they be of concern although coroner be do their level well they be limited certainly in birmingham in what they can do if they do not have the resource hope that the minister can take that issue away for review and support agree with my hon friend about the good work that coroner do up and down the country there must be training awareness and sensitivity within coroner service registrar and local council for example in birmingham we have relationship whereby there be rapid release system as hospital understand the sensitivity and do their utmost to ensure that body be release unfortunately to give another example one family be leave grieve because deceased body could not be give to the undertaker at queen elizabeth hospital because there be no individual who could do the handover the family have to wait over the weekend just to get the deceased body we need to look at how we can work across all sector to ensure that they be properly resource and we avoid any unnecessary delay the lack of resource and coroner across the country have knock on effect on the nhs there be an additional administrative and logistical burden from hold body and deal with family who be get in contact every hour many time that take staff away from frontline service do the hon member agree that have the right level of coroner service would reduce the burden of knock on cost on the nhs agree but be conscious of the time so will swiftly wrap up my speech this be not partisan issue it be not even religious issue this be human issue it affect people of faith and of no faith no one deserve to wait week or long to say goodbye to those they love let we act not just with policy but with purpose let we fund reform and rebuild system that respect every community honour every tradition and put compassion first once more with my own father islamic funeral take place very recently in birmingham too be very interested in the minister response my condolence to you on your loss madam deputy speaker congratulate the hon member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan on secure this important debate thank he for his emotive speech and all hon member who contribute represent the view of bereaved family sometimes include their own it be appreciate and they have do so dutifully the house will be aware that although the ministry of justice be responsible for coronial law and policy in england and wales it do not have operational oversight of the coronial system coroner service be not centralise as part of his majesty courts and tribunals service and be instead administer and fund through the relevant local authority for each coroner area the chief coroner provide judicial leadership for coroner take this opportunity as other member have to express my thank to all coroner their officer and their staff as well as the chief coroner and her team for their tireless and expert commitment to their work we be all extremely grateful to they for the vital service they provide to the bereaved and to the justice system coroner be independent judicial office holder they be specialist death investigation judge and part of the wide death investigation certification and registration system their statutory duty be to investigate any death of which they become aware if they suspect that it be violent or unnatural in its cause its cause be unknown or it occur in custody or other state detention they also have an ancillary duty to ensure that in appropriate case action to prevent future death be identify via prevention of future death report the need of the bereaved particularly where there be faith concern in respect of death should remain central to the coroner process both the lord chancellor as west midland mp and be very aware of local concern about coroner provision for community that require swift burial or cremation clearly decision about the release of the body include whether to hold post mortem examination be independent judicial decision for the coroner however know that in many jurisdiction include in the west midland family have experience real delay sometimes that be because the coroner need to gather further evidence to support the investigation fully understand that regardless of the reason delay can cause real distress for bereaved family particularly when faith requirement be dependent on the timely release of love one body we be work hard to cut delay wherever possible and to ensure that family be properly communicate with and support throughout the process particularly so that we can ensure that any religious ceremony or faith requirement can be meet as they should there be already range of measure in place to help guide coroner as to good practice in term of early decision make once death have be report in order to ensure that family can be give certainty as soon as possible the chief coroner have issue detailed practical guidance for coroner in deal with request for urgent consideration of death and early release of deceased body include on religious ground the guidance set out that legal framework and state coroners should pay appropriate respect to those wish within the framework of their legal duty and in the context of other responsibility in addition the chief coroner have issue guidance on the use of post mortem imaging include ct scanning and on pathology more generally which emphasise that the family should be keep fully inform throughout regularly meet the chief coroner to ensure that we have share understanding of the issue with the coroner system include this one be also happy to engage with representative of faith community to understand their concern and to meet hon member to discuss the matter far as the house will know the justice committee undertake an inquiry into the coroner service in with follow up in the government respond to the committee letter of may summarise their finding in december that letter have be publish by the committee it be right that our focus should be on ensure that the bereaved be at the heart of the process hope the house will find it helpful if set out number of step that the government be take to address the issue raise by the justice committee other stakeholder and hon member after just few month in office in september this government implement the statutory medical examiner system in england and wales it represent the most fundamental change to the end to end process of death certification and registration in recent time the new system mean that every death be subject either to the scrutiny of medical examiner or to coroner investigation thereby fulfil the long stand ambition of successive government to introduce robust system whereby all death without exception be subject to an independent review medical examiner and coroner have distinct role the new arrangement will ensure that case be manage in the right part of the system and that only those death that require judicial investigation be refer to the coroner that will enable well focus of coronial resource which in turn be expect to support the reduction of inqu backlog and delay hope we be already see the evidence of that just last week the ministry of justice coroner statistic be publish death be report to coroner in the low level since and down compare to that be because follow the creation of the new system only those who genuinely need to go to the coroner will do so in addition post mortem examination be order by coroner in fall compare to to reduce the burden and time it take for post mortem do the minister agree that we should use technology and mri and ct scan wherever possible which will also speed up the release of the body appreciate the hon member contribution as have say that guidance be there and that equipment be available to coroner if they deem it necessary of course we want to see anything that will help speed up the process for family although we want to wait full year for the proper datum next may the early evidence be encouraging that the new arrangement be work as intend reduce the number of unnecessary case be refer to coroner mean that coronial resource can be focus on the most complex death while reduce the impact and burden on family it also mean that the number of post mortem examination that subsequently reveal natural cause of death may also be reduce since those case may be identify by well surveillance and scrutiny much early in the process more widely we recognise the concern express by the justice committee and hon member present about the shortage of pathologist particularly child pathologist available to undertake coronial post mortem examination that be long stand and complex problem and its resolution require cross government approach be happy to reassure hon member that such an approach be take place be meet my counterpart in the department of health and social care to look at how we can fix the issue in the long term coroner rely on the pool of pathologist work in the wide medical system include the nhs to perform those examination we be carefully consider the view of the justice committee in its report as well as the datum we have gather from our call for evidence on coronial pathology which be issue in late with view to publish new strategy for improve coronial pathology in due course we recognise the impact that inquest hearing be have and be do all we can to process that backlog as quickly as possible we will work with the chief coroner to continue to build on the foundation that have be put in place to reduce the time know that coroner in the west midland be well below the national average as we have already hear the black country coroner area complete inquest in an average of week and birmingham and solihull and coventry complete inquest in an average time of and week respectively bereaved family should not be leave wait long than be necessary for inquest to be complete we be work on number of area include on guide to make coroner service more accessible we be consider all we can do and all the recommendation and be happy to come back to the house in due course we will work with the chief coroner on the content of all material and to reinforce the use and dissemination of these guidance document the hon member for birmingham perry barr speak about mp make representation mp be elect to this house to represent their constituent and they should be able to do so will raise his point with the chief coroner when meet she soon recognise the concern express today as well as the wide concern express by the justice committee and other stakeholder about the importance of an effective coroner service we will continue to do all we can to ensure that the system continue to put its focus on find answer on behalf of the deceased that bereaved family be always at the heart of the process that lesson be learn from any death and that this learning be disseminate as quickly and as widely as possible to protect the public question put and agree to house adjourn
