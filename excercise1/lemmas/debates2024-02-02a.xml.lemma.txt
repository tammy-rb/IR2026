let first warmly congratulate my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford on her success in the ballot and on use that success for this purpose be delighted that she have choose school attendance as the subject of her bill it be subject that know be close to her heart and one that she have champion with aplomb and with impact she say towards the end of her remark that attendance be the key to child future and agree we have often say that reading be the most fundamental thing in school because if child can not read properly they can not access the curriculum and nothing else work but attendance be even more important whatever our brilliant teacher be do in school if the child be not there they can not benefit thank my hon friend and the opposition spoke person the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell for their contribution we all recognise the importance of regular attendance not only for child attainment but for their wellbeing and development there be evidence that some attitude to absence have change since the pandemic with somewhat great propensity among some family to keep child with minor illness such as cough or cold at home whereas prior to the pandemic they would have go to school it be worth say that before covid great progress have be make on attendance since and we be commit to get back to those level they will never be for obvious reason every child will be off school ill at some point and sadly some child will need to be off for extend period but we need to get back to that pre pandemic level of or above be pleased to confirm that the government fully support this bill from my right hon friend the member for chelmsford we be explore all possible avenue to make our attendance guidance statutory include the use of exist power that be important because we want every child to be able to achieve their potential and attend school regularly be obviously crucial to that as my right hon friend outline this bill will improve the consistency of support available in all part of england first by require school of all type to have and to publicise school attendance policy and secondly by introduce new general duty on local authority to seek to improve attendance and reduce absence in their area the bill will require school and local authority to have regard to statutory guidance in practice that will see we revise and reissue our work together to improve school attendance guidance it be widely support by school trust and local authority and both the education committee and the children commissioner have already call for it to be make statutory the guidance be introduce in september and have already start to make difference there be few pupil persistently absent or not attend in than in overall absence for the autumn term just go be which be down from in autumn to turn it the other way around attendance in that term be up year on year from to however while we of course welcome that improvement there be still further to go to get to those pre pandemic level and well and there be still part of the country where family do not have access to the right support as my hon friend the member for aylesbury rob butler rightly identify it be important to legislate to end the postcode lottery so that any family can get the support they need and do so will give parent increase clarity and level up standard across school and local authority that be also an important part of this government emphasis on support first approach mean that school and local authority work together to break down the barrier that can stop pupil attend to support school and local authority in meet those expectation the government already have comprehensive attendance strategy and this aspect of it be only one part of much wide whole we have deploy attendance adviser to support local authority and number of trust we have create new data tool with of state fund school sign up at the system leadership level we have convene the attendance action alliance to work across sector to remove barrier to attendance and reduce absence we have launch attendance hub to reach more than million pupil and we have expand our attendance mentor pilot as my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central jo gideon rightly mention to reach priority education investment area of course much wide work be in place as well more child be now eligible for free school meal as result of the protection put in place on universal credit transition million have be spend on breakfast club and it be target at where it be most need where it can have the most effect say to the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north that that do include secondary school as well as primary school we also have in place the holiday activity and food programme we be increase the pupil premium in to billion of course attendance be one of the great factor and important driver in narrow the gap between well off and more disadvantaged pupil we be expand the supporting families programme over this spending review period and address attendance at school where there be problem be fundamental part of that programme my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne mention the last effect sadly of the pandemic and the importance of socialisation and he be absolutely right we often think of the early year and the effect on the young child but this be actually true throughout child or young person development he particularly mention the year to year transition point which we know be pivotal in so many way and lot of school be do some very good work there my right hon friend specifically ask about mental health and the possibility of an absence code understand his motivation and that of other in raise that point let just say that practicality question be involve at the moment someone be take the register it be not always practical for they to be able to say that something be one particular type of health issue or another and there be the risk that we would have inaccurate reporting and misunderstanding of trend as result he also mention the wide work on mental health he will know that we be put forward grant for every state school to be able to train senior mental health lead in addition the really important wide work on mental health support team support cluster of school primary as well as secondary continue to grow my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central mention not only the mentor programme but the importance of extra curricular activity and pastoral care that be really important and we need always to be say that this be about not only learn and attainment but everything else that come with school of course join my hon friend the member for aylesbury in congratulate aylesbury high school he be right also to ask about cost for local authority and for we not to overburden school in advance of issue our exist guidance on attendance we carry out the comprehensive new burden assessment which find that the expectation could be implement by local authority without additional funding if they have the average number of staff work on attendance we be confident that that assessment remain accurate base on grow body of evidence since that assessment be publish the evidence show that where local authority be deliver the guidance staffing level have remain within those predict level but my hon friend the member for aylesbury be also right to talk about ensure that we do not overburden school themselves join he in pay tribute to school leader schoolteacher and wide staff for the extraordinary work that we have hear be go on and what they be do to get child into school absolutely agree with he that we need to ensure that we have proportionate approach that support the whole system the school
