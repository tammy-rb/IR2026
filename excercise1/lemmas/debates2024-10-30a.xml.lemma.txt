their retirement that commitment mean that while work age benefit will be uprate in line with cpi at the basic and new state pension will be uprate by in this mean that over million pensioner will gain up to next year up to more than uprating by inflation the pension credit standard minimum guarantee will also rise by from around per year to around year for single pensioner while have seek to protect work people with measure to reduce the cost of living have have to take some very difficult decision on tax want to set out my approach to fuel duty bake into the number that inherit from the previous government be an assumption that fuel duty will rise in line with the retail price index next year and that the temporary cut will be reverse to retain the cut and to freeze fuel duty again would cost over billion next year at time when the fiscal position be so difficult have to be frank with the house that that be substantial commitment to make have conclude that in these difficult circumstance while the cost of living remain high and with backdrop of global uncertainty increase fuel duty next year would be the wrong choice for work people it would mean fuel duty rise by per litre so have decide today to freeze fuel duty next year and will maintain the exist cut for another year too there will be no high taxis at the petrol pump next year the last government make cut of billion to employee and self employ national insurance in their final two budgets those tax cut be not honest because we now know that they be base on forecast that the obr say would have be materially different have it know the true extent of the last government cover up since july have be urge on multiple occasion to reconsider those cut to increase the taxis that work people pay and see in their payslip but have make an important choice today to keep every single commitment that we make on tax in our manifesto say to work people will not increase your national insurance will not increase your vat and will not increase your income tax work people will not see high taxis in their payslip as result of the choice be make today that be promise make and promise fulfil any responsible chancellor would need to make difficult decision today to raise the revenue require to fund our public service and restore economic stability so in today budget be announce an increase in employer national insurance contribution we will increase the rate of employer national insurance by percentage point to from april and we will reduce the secondary threshold the level at which employer start pay national insurance on each employee salary from year to this will raise billion per year by the end of the forecast period know that this be difficult choice do not take this decision lightly we be ask business to contribute more and know that there will be impact of this measure feel beyond business too as the obr have set out today interruption order our constituent be watch they need to be able to hear the chancellor simmer down in the circumstance have inherit it be the right choice to make successful business depend on successful school healthy business depend on healthy nhs and strong economy depend on strong public finance if the conservative party choose to oppose this choice it be choose more austerity more chaos and more instability that be the choice our country face too as make this choice know it be particularly important to protect our small company have hear representation from the federation of small businesses and other be today increase the employment allowance from to this mean that employer will not pay any national insurance at all next year and over million will pay the same or less than they do previously this will allow small business to employ the equivalent of four full time worker on the national living wage without pay any national insurance on their wage let now come to capital gain tax we need to drive growth promote entrepreneurship and support wealth creation while raise the revenue require to fund our public service and restore our public finance today we will increase the low rate of capital gain tax from to and the high rate from to while maintain the rate of capital gain tax on residential property at and this mean that the uk will still have the low capital gain tax rate of any european economy alongside these change to the headline rate of capital gain tax we be maintain the lifetime limit for business asset disposal relief at million to encourage entrepreneur to invest in their business business asset disposal relief will remain at this year before rise to in april and to from maintain significant gap compare with the high rate of capital gain tax together the obr say that these measure will raise billion by the end of the forecast in sign of this government commitment to support growth and entrepreneurship we have already extend the enterprise investment and venture capital trust scheme to and we will continue to work with lead entrepreneur and venture capital firm to ensure that our policy support positive environment for entrepreneurship in the uk next turn to inheritance tax only of estate will pay inheritance tax this year understand the strongly hold desire to pass down saving to child and grandchild so be take balanced approach in my package today first the previous government freeze inheritance tax threshold until will extend that freeze for further two year until that mean that the first of any estate can be inherit tax free rise to if the estate include residence pass to direct descendant and million when tax free allowance be pass to surviving spouse or civil partner secondly we will close the loophole create by the previous government make even big when the lifetime allowance be abolish by bring inherit pension into inheritance tax from april finally we will reform agricultural property relief and business property relief from april the first million of combined business and agricultural asset will continue to attract no inheritance tax at all but for asset over million inheritance tax will apply with relief at an effective rate of this will ensure that we continue to protect small family farm with three quarter of claim unaffected by these change can also announce that we will apply relief in all circumstance on inheritance tax for share on the alternative investment market and other similar market set the effective rate of tax at take together these measure raise over billion by the final year of the forecast next can

up of electric vehicle so will maintain the incentive for electric vehicle in company car tax from and increase the differential between fully electric and other vehicle in the first year rate of vehicle excise duty from april these measure will raise around million by the end of the forecast period let update the house on our plan for air passenger duty and can see the leader of the opposition ear have prick up air passenger duty have not keep up with inflation in recent year so we be introduce an adjustment mean an increase of no more than for an economy class short haul flight but be take different approach when it come to private jet increase the rate of air passenger duty by further that be equivalent to per passenger for private jet to say california laughter let we now turn to our high street business know that for they major source of concern be business rate from we intend to introduce two permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property which

the path of irresponsibility the path take by liz truss and ignore the problem in our public finance all together if that be their choice they should say so but let be clear if they disagree with my choice on tax they would not be able to protect work people if they disagree with our plan to fund public service they would have to cut school and hospital if they disagree with our investment rule they would have to delay or cancel thousand of project that drive growth across our country this be moment of fundamental choice for britain have make my choice the responsible choice to restore

november budget resolutions income tax charge motion make and question propose that income tax be charge for the tax year and it be declare that it be expedient in the public interest that this resolution should have statutory effect under the provision of the provisional collection of taxes act reeves call the leader of the opposition on the day that the prime minister take office he say that he want to restore trust to british politic with action not word today his action speak for themselves with budget that contain broken promise after broken promise and reveal the simple truth that the prime minister and the chancellor have not be straight with the british people time and again we conservatives warn that labour government would tax borrow and spend far beyond what they be tell the country and time and again they deny they have such plan today the truth have come out proof that labour plan to do this all along today budget see the fiscal rule fiddle borrowing increase by billion of pound inflation bust handout for the trade order just as we respect the chancellor and hear she speak we will hear the leader of the opposition britain poor pensioner squeeze welfare spending out of control and spree of tax rise that the government promise the work people of this country they would not do national insurance up capital gain tax up inheritance tax up energy taxis up business rate up first time buyer stamp duty up pension tax up they have fiddle the figure interruption order the public will also want to hear what the leader of the opposition have to say those who see shouting will not be call to speak later on simmer labour member do not like it but this be the truth they have fiddle the figure and raise tax to record level they have break their promise and it be the work people of this country who will pay the price the chancellor and prime minister have try to say that they have no choice but let we be in no doubt their misleading claim about the state of the economy be nothing but cynical political device today situation be world away from the genuinely bleak legacy that we conservative inherit from the last labour government the chancellor forget to point out that borrowing be in every that they spend with debt rise every year and unemployment at understand the chancellor shameless political motivation and why it suit she to cook up false justification for her agenda but today the obr have decline to back up her claim of fictional billion black hole it appear nowhere in its report it be deeply disappointing that she have seek to politicise the independent obr which should be above party politic as the chancellor now know her playing politic have do real damage to our economy she talk about be bank of england economist but the bank of england former chief economist have say that labour approach have generate fear foreboding and uncertainty among consumer business and investor the rhetoric of this chancellor and this prime minister be damage the british economy for political purpose we need only to look at the fact to see that the chancellor claim about her economic inheritance be nonsense labour inherit an economy with inflation back at its target mortgage rate cut and unemployment low when we leave office the united kingdom be the fast grow advanced economy in the world when it come to the public finance not once have the chancellor acknowledge that we take the right decision to spend half trillion pound to protect the british people from the impact of covid and putin war let remind the house that not only do the labour party support all those intervention it want we to go even far when make the tough choice to fix the public finance afterwards the prime minister and chancellor opportunistically oppose every step of the way so will take no lecture from those two about difficult decision but because of the decision we make the chancellor inherit low borrowing than france america italy and japan and the second low debt in the entire any which way you look at it labour claim about its inheritance be purely ludicrous these be her choice so stop blame everyone else and take responsibility for they interruption let turn to the substance of those choice during the election the chancellor repeatedly promise that her plan be fully fund only few week ago the prime minister say the budget would balance the book but this budget do no such thing and reveal that they have not be straight with the british people interruption order can see you even when you be hide behind another colleague yell across the chamber be not on the public our constituent be watch know emotion be high and expect some noise but will definitely call you out today the chancellor have launch an enormous borrowing spree saddle our child and grandchild with billion upon billion of pound of more debt push up interest rate leave our economy more expose to future shock and lead the obr today to now forecast high inflation in every year of the forecast her decision to let borrowing rip make total nonsense of her claim on the state of the public finance if they truly be in such dire state as she have say what we should have see today be significant reduction in borrow to repair they not the splurge she have just unleash instead what we see be borrow high in every year of the forecast and debt high in every year of the forecast now the chancellor have try to cover up that splurge by fiddle the fiscal rule accord to the institute for fiscal studies the new measure will not actually even be constraint on the amount she can borrow it say it be hard to escape the suspicion that the government be attract to this change by the fact that it would allow for significantly more borrowing without any need for tough choice elsewhere fiscal fiddling be what it have call it the chancellor herself actually agree she specifically tell the british people she would not change the debt target she say she be not go to fiddle the figure to get well result but that be exactly what she have do she have go back on her word and fiddle the figure so she can borrow billion more break promise after broken promise and work people will pay the price the reason the chancellor have increase borrowing and increase taxis be because she have totally fail to grip public spending first she have no meaningful plan to deliver the billion worth of saving available if the public sector simply return to its pre pandemic level of productivity instead one of the first thing the chancellor do be to hand out inflation bust pay rise to the union without get any productivity enhance reform in return the chancellor also scrap her predecessor plan to get the civil service back to its pre pandemic number she do not seem to think that the civil service can be reduce by single person and the chancellor have no plan to control welfare spending yet if we simply get work age welfare spending on people with disability or health condition back to pre covid level that would free up billion worth of saving whether it be scrap our plan to shrink the civil service or their failure to control welfare spending this be not her inheritance these be her choice the result high spending high borrowing high taxis it be break promise after broken promise and work people pay the price let turn next to growth and remind the prime minister and chancellor that they do in fact inherit the fast grow economy in the that be testament to the last government boost investment by introduce full expensing increase the labour supply by expand childcare reform welfare and cut tax on work all decision the obr say would increase growth the chancellor have say that grow the economy be the government no priority the prime minister even say that high growth would come very quickly to be fair the prime minister and chancellor have have rapid impact on growth as their plan for the economy become clear survey after survey show business confidence plummet no wonder the government own assessment say their french style labour law will impose labour members will be explain it to the business in their constituency that their labour law by their own assessment will impose billion direct cost on business disproportionately hit small business as business group after business group have point out the tax rise on job and enterprise in today budget will hobble poll tax on business be what they have call it despite the record break tax rise despite fiddle the figure and despite let borrowing soar today the obr have forecast that growth will be low under this government than it be forecast to be under the conservatives that be the change they have work this be what happen when the labour party be lead by people who have no experience of business and enterprise relentlessly talk down our economy deliver tidal wave of anti business regulation destroy our flexible labour market and raise taxis to the high level in our country history it be the classic labour agenda high taxis high borrowing no plan for growth and work people pay the price during the election campaign the prime minister specifically say there would be no tax surprise under labour the chancellor go even far say she want to bring taxis down each time they make those promise we warn that they be not tell the truth today the chancellor and prime minister have do what they be always plan to do but choose to keep hide from the british people far from reduce taxis as result of today budget never in the history of our country have taxis be high than they be under this labour government they specifically promise that they would not raise tax on work people the chancellor say labour will not put up your income tax national insurance or vat just this month the prime minister give an absolute commitment to not raise tax on work people what do today budget do it raise tax on work people by increase national insurance and break labour promise as the independent institute for fiscal studies have say this be straightforward breach of labour manifesto because as the office for budget responsibility have make clear this tax rise be pass through entirely to work people even since the chancellor start speak the ifs have already confirm that the vast majority of this tax increase will hit work people through low pay however we do not need to take it from the ifs or even the obr we can take it from the chancellor herself she have previously describe her tax rise as job tax which take money out of people report october vol and not only that the chancellor also say that the problem with national insurance be that it be tax purely on people who go to work and those who employ they far from protect work people she be literally raise the only major tax that exclusively hit work people but it do not stop there business on the british high street your taxis be go up business invest in british energy your taxis be go up the small business owner look to reap the reward of year spend grow business and create job your taxis be go up the young couple save to buy their first home your taxis be go up the order mr streeting you promise this morning let we try and keep our promise be sure that those on the government front bench be want to explain to the young couple in their constituency save to buy their first home that their taxis be go up and to the family want to pass on their farm or their business to their child that their taxis be go up the parent sacrifice to give their kid the good start in life your taxis be go up they be tax your job they be tax your business they be tax your home they be tax your saving say during the election campaign you name it labour will tax it and that be exactly what the government have do with broken promise after broken promise and work people pay the price for the final time from this dispatch box let deliver some basic truth government can foster growth but they can not magically conjure it up we need business worker investor and entrepreneur to all back this country and build our economy it do not matter whether your income come in pay packet from investment in dividend or in profit it be poor politic that be so focused on what people receive that it fail to see that what matter be what people put in the only way to grow the economy and to create wealth be for people to put in more so when you create negative environment for business when you undermine confidence in our country when you vilify and penalise people for do exactly what we need they to do which be to invest take risk and work hard you do not create growth you hold back growth and more than that the promise of growth tomorrow do not pay the bill today this be not the first government to peddle the borrow to grow myth but time and again we have see the same ending not high growth but high debt high inflation and high taxis but madam deputy speaker whatever you think about the economic argument surround today budget there be more fundamental point with which want to conclude the prime minister have talk relentlessly about trust yet today budget reveal above all that those in the labour party do not tell the truth they say they would not fiddle the figure they have they say they would not increase borrowing they have they say they would not raise taxis on work people they have there have be break promise after broken promise and it be the work people of this country who will pay the price on point of order madam deputy speaker it have well be genuine relevant point of order wonder if you could give some advice madam deputy speaker because fear that the chancellor may have inadvertently fail to declare an interest she speak great deal about work people during her speech be she work person and should she declare that or maybe she be that be not relevant point of order and it will be note in case the hon gentleman wish to put forward any further point of order now call the chair of the treasury committee before begin must as well as draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests draw its attention to the fact that have family member who work for allied irish bank have be look forward to today feel honoured to have be choose by this house on cross party basis to chair the treasury committee and to be the first labour treasury committee chair to welcome the budget of labour government and our first female labour chancellor think that after year wait this would be an exciting moment and in moment of sentimentality realise that for the second time today would be follow the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak be go to reflect on an interesting constitutional position when be in my former role as chair of the public accounts committee there be common ground at time with the prime minister of the day in private when have cause to meet the right hon gentleman he be courteous thoughtful and respectful have the national interest at heart and when it come to constitutional matter be in very much the same place as be therefore very disappointed today by the cheek of the right hon gentleman in stand up and have the chutzpah to talk about fear foreboding and uncertainty it be the mini budget that plunge the country into crisis put up the mortgage rate of our constituent and be still leave people live in great hardship it be on the right hon gentleman watch as chancellor although he do some thing about covid that we would all recognise need to be do and we recognise it at the time that the bounce back loan lead to significant amount of the fraud that result from covid now my right hon friend the chancellor have stand up and what have happen the ftse be up and it have go up by more since stand up by percentage point unless anyone can update and the obr have say that this will add growth to the economy the right hon gentleman also attack the chancellor on fiscal rule let we be clear fiscal rule be not new thing since there have be seven fiscal mandate five supplementary debt target two supplementary borrowing target and an investment limit the rule set in last three year but in the last three year we have have three different fiscal mandate two different supplementary debt cap and one supplementary borrowing target think the chancellor know that when she be in front of the treasury committee we may challenge she and ask she about her fiscal rule but have certainty we all have certainty that she will be in her post for long enough to stick to the fiscal rule that she have set they will have longevity beyond the previous government welcome this budget and pay tribute to my right hon friend the uk first woman chancellor stand at that dispatch box and another glass ceiling be shatter she should be proud we be proud and congratulate she on that achievement it be my first budget as chair of the treasury committee have spend year examine public spending in enormous detail include nine year as chair of the public accounts committee like the chancellor be scrutineer she chair the business and trade committee and she understand the importance of scrutiny be very clear that the treasury committee will not give the chancellor an easy ride because she be highly capable woman who can come and explain all her decision to we she know that it be our job to rigorously examine the detail of the budget next wednesday when she will appear in front we she will be get bit of what she dish out as chair of the business and trade committee know that she will expect nothing less than robust challenge if she be not up to it she would not be in her post have to say that be disappointed that so much of this budget be reveal before today which be not normal practice go forward hope that constituent and the mps represent they will be the first to know about major issue and that courtesy to this house and the treasury committee will be hallmark of treasury engagement this budget come at very exciting time but it be difficult one for the chancellor she have make it very clear that she will deliver certainty and she have inherit one hell of mess we have have tumultuous period brexit the pandemic the mini budget year of austerity delay and fail decision particularly on capital spending we have have three carbon capture and storage project that have never come to fruition the saga and cost of stop and start on high speed pupil in school that be not fit for purpose public service on their knee and public sector net debt at its high rate since the second world war congratulate the hon lady on her unopposed election as chair of the wonderful treasury committee do she share my concern that the individual who have be appoint to the office for value for money be previously on the board of the hon lady be former chair of the treasury committee and welcome she be member of it as she will add great value as she know we will have the opportunity to raise question with the chancellor at next week hearing she have now be forewarn that the hon lady may ask about this issue it be important that we recognise good people who provide support in the public sector by watch our public finance and always take people on good faith unless have reason not to do so we have an opportunity to explore this issue elsewhere as share of gdp taxis be high than at any time since world war two before the election my right hon friend the chancellor be tough on spending commitment and sometimes there be bit of moaning in the tea room do not want to tell tale out of school but shadow ministers be dismay because they could not spend everything that they want to spend as chair of the public accounts committee at the time however know what she be talk about and that what be come be not go to be pretty so welcome some of the step that she have announce today have not have chance to look in the red book or at the detail but the multi year funding settlement that she have put in place be great opportunity to give certainty to business and investor in our country hopefully we will finally nail the issue of which have cost the taxpayer fortune we need to get on with that in order to make sure that we be deliver investment for our country look forward to see the detail on cladding but it be big issue in my constituency where many people life be on hold as result the money for affordable home be incredibly vital for those live in difficult situation and the chancellor be absolutely right to have finally fund the compensation scheme for infected blood victim and for postmaster and postmistress when the state make an error the state need to correct it it should never be party political football the chancellor have have to make tough choice and she have set out her fiscal rule to provide clarity to the market and long term trajectory for investment and growth we on the treasury committee will watch net financial debt closely to see how the benefit be measure and it be important for taxpayer and the market that we do so she will be more aware than anyone about the impact on the market if she do not manage debt very carefully international investor may use the exist debt model so when she come in front of the treasury committee would be interested in talk to she about how she see this play out in the international arena have enormous respect for the hon lady give she previous role and her important new role as chair of the treasury committee as the chancellor will be come to see the committee shortly could the hon lady put question to she on my behalf we all know that we can learn lesson from previous budgets about the law of unintended consequence the thing that most concern in this budget be the combination of raise employer national insurance contribution cut the threshold at which they start pay ni and raise the minimum wage could the hon lady ask the chancellor whether there will be special support for business that employ lot of people on low wage such as care home and childcare setting which will be most impact by the measure otherwise the cost will be pass on the hon lady be very experienced member of this house and she have make her point she will no doubt have the opportunity to speak in this budget debate and there will be plenty of opportunity across the committee corridor welcome she as fellow chair committee chairs be already plan how we will work together to ensure that we hold the government to account whichever party we represent the fiscal rule be design to provide fiscal certainty and predictability to bring sense of discipline to the public finance and to reassure the market as have mention welcome that stability as will the market as the ftse increase suggest give the headroom that the chancellor have secure under the new rule the treasury committee will be watch how much she invest because we need to see the growth that she have set out as her goal that must be sustainable so it need to be productivity growth there be no single solution but analysis by the resolution foundation find that increase in capital stock increase productivity by we will look closely at this and at the spending review in on tax the increase in employer national insurance to be an understandable measure it be always challenge to find money in these difficult fiscal circumstance but the increase bring money into the exchequer at fast pace than some of the other measure that be mention in the medium have wide approach to read about thing if we read the daily telegraph we will think the world be go to hell in handcart but if we read more measured commentary we will find that the chancellor be judge well on what she have achieve today as the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage say there be concern about how the measure in the budget interact alongside sister committees we on the treasury committee will examine those will the hon lady and the treasury committee look very carefully at the chancellor proposal on agricultural property relief they be very likely to do damage to small family own farm and especially to tenant who be likely to be evict as consequence will she look at what that might do not just for basic justice but for food security in this country if be the sort of person to get big headed as result of the number of member ask to do thing that be probably not within my remit could extend the remit and the power of the treasury committee infinitely of course it be the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael who chair the environment food and rural affairs committee as say we chairs be plan to ensure that we work closely together on issue where there be an overlap of interest and we will pick up on all these issue the government have promise openness transparency and accountability and take my front benchers at their word on that be sure that the chancellor and her ministers will be available to talk to people and address members concern about specific element of the budget welcome some of the other measure that have be announce the increase in the national living wage will make huge difference for so many of my constituent they work hard and be certainly not shirker as some conservative members might call they but they can barely make end meet in my constituency many people work four day week because they earn enough to be able to do so other have four job over seven day just to hold body and soul together welcome the increase and the removal of age discrimination the devolution model make so much sense in so many way on the public accounts committee we repeatedly look at the challenge of bidding for pot of fund which be costly and time consume we need to trust our elect mayors to make decision for their area and the model show the direction of trust that hopefully this government will continue to go down before the last general election list what call the big nastie this be just some of the additional spending that need to take place on thing that have be leave sometimes by the previous government and sadly sometimes by successive government these issue include the reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete failure in school welcome the move finally to deal with that the long waiting list in the nhs and overcrowded prison from the red book it look as though the justice department have have an uplift although it be difficult to make full judgment on that in the few minute have have to glance through it other thing such the animal and plant health agency in weybridge and porton down need investment these be risky thing not to invest in there be go to be challenge in public spending even with the increase although the increase be welcome the growth that the chancellor have call for and be try to achieve will be require in order to deliver and ensure that we see the spending that we need even with the uplift that she highlight the from next year in day to day spending this be very tight financial situation for all government departments the boost to the department of health and social care be staggering and welcome be sure that the public accounts committee the treasury committee and the health and social care committee will among we hold the health secretary to account for his promise to make sure that that be spend well and deliver permanent and lasting change also the capital investment be desperately necessary it be not that long ago that the previous government raid capital budget for day to day spending in the nhs that can not be allow to continue the investment in defence be also absolutely necessary there be huge gap in the defence equipment plan which know my right hon friend the chancellor be all over and she be right to make that increase look forward to the path to of gdp on defence never again should we be go below that local government although it have have boost be go to be very squeeze again we will be work with sister committees to look at that the chancellor also promise to close or reduce the tax gap that be very bold and difficult to deliver so again the committee will be look closely at how it be deal with as well as at the recovery of fraud money which can be challenge to deliver in any particular timescale rise will give way to the chairman of the public accounts committee thank the chair of the treasury committee and congratulate she on her new role there be one very welcome bit of the budget today and that be the funding for the infected blood scheme and the post office horizon scheme but will she join in urge the chancellor to ensure that those amount be quickly pay out so that those victim whom we hear about almost every day in the medium be rapidly compensate and can get their life back to normal it seem that the chair of the public accounts committee this be something the hon gentleman and have in common hear promise make by government of different colour who do not always deliver as they should he be absolutely right in fact the national audit office at my request pull together document look at compensation scheme they be often put together differently although these particular scheme have now be set and some do not deliver as well as other windrush be also in that mix this be important and perhaps the hon gentleman be offer his service to the chancellor to ensure that that money get out of the door of course his committee will be examine these programme as time go on it give great pleasure to respond to the budget today and to welcome labour chancellor to her place wish she well and wish the labour government well of course want to see these result on the ground in my constituency as say the chancellor will appear in front of our committee without fear or favour over the come year and we will be challenge she and her ministers to make sure that they stick to the promise that she have lay out today we now come to the leader of the liberal democrats sir ed davey it be pleasure to follow the chair of the treasury committee the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier and wish she all the good in her new role especially give her promise to scrutinise this budget very very closely join she in note that this be an historic day this be the first budget to be present by female chancellor and congratulate the right hon member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves be sure that she be blaze the trail for the woman and girl who be watch our proceeding today there can be no doubt about the enormous task face the chancellor after year of chaos and decline under the conservatives their appalling economic legacy set out so clearly in the figure today be be feel by people across the united kingdom people be look to this budget for clean break with those failure of the past few year and for sense of hope and urgency and the promise of fair deal but fear that the budget will not deliver all that the conservatives leave behind an enormous mess in our nhs but be afraid it will not be fix unless the government fix social care too the cost of living crisis will not be solve by hit family pensioner family farm and struggle small business and our economy will not grow strongly again unless we repair our broken relationship with europe liberal democrats will continue to stand up for our constituent and press the government to be far bold and act much fast on people priority have say that let recognise that there be some good thing in the budget welcome the chancellor decision to move away from the conservatives break fiscal rule to allow the capital investment that our country so desperately need be genuinely surprised that there be no recognition from the leader of the opposition of the difference between capital and current spending which be at the heart of this change welcome the promise of full compensation for the victim of the contaminated blood scandal and the horizon scandal and hope that that can be deliver quickly also welcome the extra investment in our nhs fix the crisis in our nhs be literally matter of life and death it be also essential for grow our economy by get people off waiting list and get they fit and healthy and back into work the conservatives leave the health service on its knee we on the liberal democrat benches have consistently argue for more investment across the nhs in hospital building extra gps cancer nurse new radiotherapy machine and much more so be glad that the government and the chancellor have be listen however people have hear bold promise of extra gps and new hospital before the conservatives make similar promise on the nhs and then break they so what we need now be guarantee that this government will deliver can assure the chancellor that liberal democrats will hold the government to account on their nhs plan and hope that the budget document set out in full the answer to some obvious question when will the funding be in place for desperately need hospital project and when will those project be complete when will the government be able to guarantee that people can see gp or an nhs dentist when they need one when will all cancer patient be able to start treatment within the day target and not have to wait for month when will people know once more that when they call an ambulance it will be there within minute not hour above all as have say before worry that despite the welcome extra investment announce today the government will not be able to fix the nhs because they be ignore the elephant in the nhs waiting room the crisis in social care we all know how bad it be hundred of thousand of people be wait for care and many be strand in hospital bed because the care be not in place for they to leave hospital that be bad for they bad for their love one and bad for the nhs be afraid that today announcement on social care just will not touch the side it be only standstill in crisis unless we finally tackle this problem and agree long term solution for social care we will never end the crisis in our health service so urge the government once again to start cross party talk on care without further delay and to take action now any solution must involve pay care worker properly to fill the care worker vacancy so that elderly and disabled people can get the care they need the government plan for fair pay agreement be step in the right direction but it be nowhere near enough so will the chancellor look at our plan for special high minimum wage for carer and we must not forget the vital role of unpaid family carer the hero keep the entire system afloat strongly welcome the chancellor decision to raise the earning limit for carer allowance it be good first step but as she accept in her speech on its own it will not end the repayment scandal or fix the system will she confirm whether the earning limit will in future be peg to at least hour week at the minimum wage although be glad that the review will look again at get rid of the cliff edge for carer allowance and the earning limit hope she and her colleague will consider broad review to give family carer the support they deserve the conservative cost of living crisis have hit family carer particularly hard but they be not alone practically no one have be leave untouched by rise bill high mortgage payment and soar food price our small business and the self employ have experience crisis of their own have have to deal with the pandemic and now spike energy price and other input cost the conservatives only add to that pain by hit struggle family with stealth tax rise by betray pensioner when they break the triple lock and by raise national insurance for our small business welcome the increase in the national minimum wage as it address the cost of living although urge the chancellor to extend this high wage to apprentice too however it be concern to see the chancellor repeat number of the conservatives past mistake raise employer national insurance be tax on job and people the obr report publish today show that the budget will reduce real household income and worsen the health and care crisis by hit thousand of small care provider hit family home with change to inheritance tax will not help and cut winter fuel payment will leave million of vulnerable pensioner worry sick this winter instead of adopt liberal democrat proposal to raise the money we need such as by reverse conservative tax cut for the big bank or by ask the social medium giant to pay bit more the chancellor have choose unfair tax hike that will hurt small and medium sized business which be the engine of our economy they have already pay too high price for conservative economic failure and force they to pay even more simply be not right another conservative mess that fear this budget will not begin to clean up be the crisis in local council funding year after year the previous government slash funding while ask council to do more and more the result have be nothing short of disaster spiral social care cost be huge part of this which be yet another reason why reform be so vital there be another black hole in council budget due to the broken system for special educational need and disability the extra billion announce by the chancellor be therefore welcome and pay tribute to my colleague not least my hon friend the member for twickenham munira wilson who have campaign so hard on this however fear that the crisis in send budget leave by the conservatives be much big last week the national audit office lay bare the sheer scale of the problem with half of child wait more than the week limit for an education health and care plan and with of council at risk of bankruptcy the severity of the crisis leave by the conservatives speak for itself so we need to act with even great urgency to tackle it we will press the government to give the house clear timeline for reform because neither child parent nor council can wait any long the chancellor have say that her main objective be economic growth and she be right we all agree that we need to get our economy grow strongly again to create job and opportunity for everyone and to raise the money that our public service need but we need real plan to do that and not just stop thing get bad or return to business as usual we need to build the economy of the future one that be genuinely innovative prosperous and fair part of that be about fix the health and care crisis which will be crucial as will manage the public finance responsibly and give business the certainty and stability they need to invest in our economy we must also invest in cheap clean renewable power to drive strong recovery to bring down energy bill and to create secure well pay job welcome the step that the government have take so far but we must do more to back small business they be the beat heart of our local economy so urge the chancellor to go beyond today announcement on business rate by make an historic change to overhaul the break business rate system that be destroy our high street and town centre tinker around the edge be simply not good enough any long one final crucial ingredient of growth be fix our broken relationship with europe remove the conservatives trade barrier would be massive boost for british job british business and the british economy by rule out important step such as youth mobility scheme or key long term goal such as membership of the single market the government be try to grow our economy with one arm tie behind their back in july the british people kick out of office one of the most damaging government in our country history on the conservatives watch we see living standard fall the economy stagnate and public service decline although no government would have an easy time turn that around people be look to this budget for hope and genuinely new direction they be look for urgent action to fix the health and care crisis for break from the previous government tax mistake for plan to grow our economy and to rescue local council that be on the brink and for fair deal yes the chancellor have to make big difficult decision but fear that she have get too many of they wrong we need different budget to repair the damage do to our country and to give people the fair deal they deserve for our constituent liberal democrat members will push the government to do far more for our economy for the nhs and for care those be the thing that the liberal democrats will always champion call the chair of the business and trade committee which be my old select committee congratulate our first female chancellor on deliver an outstanding budget it be great pleasure to speak in my first budget debate for year and think that period of silence be probably appreciate more by my own party than by any other when look back on those debate which listen to even though do not speak it be strike that the curtain have finally fall on an economic philosophy an economic approach and an economic settlement that have fundamentally fail this country over the past year we have witness something akin to the murders of the british economy austerity and bungle brexit follow by chaos see clearly how today budget be very different kind of settlement it honour the approach the compassion the intelligence and the judgment of the last budget present to this house by my good friend mentor and boss lord darling in march alistair darling be much miss in this place hon member hear hear he be man of dry wit patience tenacity kindness and compassion have no hint of reservation in my mind in say that this be budget of which he would have be proud because it strike the right balance all budgets be balance as we ask chancellors not only to balance the number but more importantly to balance the interest of our country compare with the budget in march the chancellor task today be far hard back in we try to present budget that would remedy deficit open up by the great financial crash since the rise we aim to get the right balance between spending restraint budget rise growth and time balance those four ingredient be at the heart of any budget judgment and our judgment would have halve the deficit within four year and see debt fall by our obsession be to avoid the double dip recession that have be experience in japan and to ensure we escape the peril of widen inequality that we have see in the united states mr osborne choose different path and he be support by the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne to whom it be my pleasure to give way the reality as the right hon gentleman know because he write to his successor about it be that he leave we with deficit that stand at fully as against the in sharp decline that we have bequeath to this government let we be really clear about what have be bequeath to this government the right hon gentleman be right that back in at the height of the financial crash the deficit go up what happen in financial crash be that the economy have heart attack spending continue because to cut spending would be to deepen recession and turn it into depression tax receipt fall off cliff and the role of government be to sustain country through that kind of crisis the deficit rise to billion yet today how much interest do we pay on the debt we have be bequeath we pay billion in interest alone which be almost the entirety of the deficit we have back in it be important for the house to recognise that that happen because mr osborne choose balance that be different he choose to load his austerity programme on public spending cut actually he eventually arrive at the same settlement that labour propose in but he take four or five year to get there and he put the economy into recession if memory serve correctly he blame it on some light snow that austerity programme be follow by brexit that be bungle and then the chaos of the former prime minister do my right hon friend recall that the previous labour government oversee the fast economic recovery from the international incident the economy be back in growth by the time of the election because of investment like over billion for research and development so our economy could compete in the race to the top not the race to the bottom that we see under the previous government correct in way that be the point that be gently try to make to the house with very brief and everyone will be pleased to hear soon to conclude lesson in the fiscal consolidation of the last year austerity bungle brexit and chaos leave we with growth rate that fall from an average of in the labour year down to over the last year we have tax forecast that fail time and time and time and time again living standard that simply do not rise in the last parliament productivity growth that collapse from about year to about year inequality that soar and as have just rehearse debt that multiply to an extraordinary trillion in the old day we use to have debate about whether the roof have be fix while the sun be shin the reality be that for the last year the conservative party have be try to patch the roof by rip out the foundation of our economy that approach have draw to close today we have only get through the last year because of the ingenuity fortitude kindness and compassion of the people we represent those people deserve well approach and that be what they get from the chancellor today we have an approach that alistair darling would have well appreciate budget balance not simply in the number but in the balance of interest if we look at the number in the red book we can see the gut of that different approach everybody know we might as well be honest in the house today that the original sin of the british economy be failure in the investment rate over the last year the approach to try to stimulate development have rely on tax cut after tax cut after tax cut after tax cut today the chancellor have end the insanity of try the same thing over and over again expect different result the capital investment deliver by this budget will see billion extra being surge into the economy the chancellor be absolutely right last week at the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank we hear clear message from the imf that unless we raise the fix rate of investment in our economy we be not go to improve living standard or the growth rate and we be not go to pay down the debt so the chancellor approach be extremely welcome the budget forecast show that over the forecast period we will now see the rate of fix investment increase in our economy by between and that be still probably not enough to catch up with our competitor but it be hell of good start and crucially it be departure from the fail economic philosophy for stimulate investment of the last year after year of failure it be time to try something new and that be what the chancellor have give we today that allow we to strike new bargain with business we can say to the business community look we will put billion extra of capital investment into the economy we will make sure you have the road the railway system and the digital infrastructure that you need for your market to function we will make sure you have workforce that be actually healthy and well fit for work and well train we will make sure there be investment in the skill you need in your business and we will make sure your worker stand hope in hell of get home somewhere near their work we will make sure there be investment in research and development why because if we put all of that together we will have the great entrepreneur in the world our entrepreneur have be make history by invent the future since the age of the industrial revolution but they need good people good idea and access to capital market which they do not have today this budget begin to make that available will the right hon gentleman and the chancellor remember that work people also live in rural area be disappoint that the word rural be mention only twice in an hour during the chancellor speech and then only as an aside no mention be make of the south west of england where there be serious pocket of deprivation except cornwall except cornwall but no town no mention be make of the rest of the south west where we suffer from lack of public transport do the right hon gentleman agree that access to public transport and primary care be vital for work people in rural area agree but say gently to right hon and hon member across the house that that be not free if we want to ensure that there be good transport link and digital link that the workforce be healthy well and train and that there be rich ecosystem of idea the money have to come from somewhere the sensible decision that have be make to increase borrow in order to fund high level of fix capital investment be wise investment in public service be wise too very much hope that that will benefit the hon lady constituency an increase in investment on the scale we have see today will improve the profitability of business in this country the business and trade committee look forward to scrutinise the detail and ensure the government have get the balance right because goodness know it be hard enough to get the balance right in budget never mind translate it into legislation that bargain for business have to consist of two side on the one hand we will create well business environment through high capital investment but on the other we have to give worker pay rise the labour share of income in this country have fall precipitously since the if the labour share of national income be as high today as it be in on average worker would be receive pay packet this year that be over big that be why we have to get the balance right between ensure that business be more profitable and ensure that worker be get their share of national income get the balance right be difficult like my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier the chair of the treasury committee my committee and will scrutinise that in detail we will begin that work when we see the secretary of state for business and trade in front of our committee in just couple of week time my final point be about where want the chancellor to go far among the bad of her inheritance be the yawn gulf in inequality that scar our country we have moral emergency in britain sale of superyacht luxury car and big mansion be at an all time high but at exactly the same time the queue for food bank have never be great there be no mystery to that over the past year the combination of easy money and low taxis on capital income have mean that the top in our country the lucky time rich than everybody else do they work time hard be they time cleverer do they win the lottery well in way they do because billion worth of quantitative easing hold interest rate in our country down by about that trigger three quarter of the rise in asset price that we have see over the past year of course people in the top will own asset and will have see windfall gain yet the rate of tax they pay on those capital gain be just half the top rate of marginal tax be sorry that the leader of the opposition be no long in his place to hear say this but he do good thing couple of year ago which be to publish his tax return be sure that all hon member will have read it it do not take long as it be only page long it declare an income of million and tax rate of at time when so many people in our country be pay top marginal rate of more than do not think that it be morally right that those with broad shoulder be pay much low tax rate would have like to have see the chancellor go far on capital gain tax welcome the change to the non dom and inheritance tax regime but would have propose other change as well if we have truly restore fairness to the tax system we could have raise money to increase the national wealth fund and open the opportunity for the first time of pay dividend into universal saving account for every young person in this country that would have help they get foot on the housing ladder repay their student debt invest in their training or kickstart saving for their pension that would have help we to create universal basic capital system in this country we will need system like that if we be to fix the scandalous inequality of wealth that now bedevil our country none the less accept that the chancellor have to put first thing first today she have to fix the foundation because as all of we in this house know if we get that job do well the good year for this country truly lie ahead of we call the father of the house it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne he say that alistair darling be his hero my hero be nigel lawson because be personally convinced that the way to create growth and prosperity be to flatten and low taxis think have sit through budget statement in this house they be quite exhausting and be quite cynical about the whole process normally large amount of good news be give out during the budget statement when we be all sit in the chamber but when we read the red book the next day we find that we be probably pay even more tax than we be before everything have be take back however this time the pain have be load up front so suppose we should be grateful for small mercy be sure the chancellor of the exchequer would claim that she be just be honest but the budget be none the less massive expansion of tax and spend government who indulge in massive expansion of tax and spend be government who gradually impoverish country more and more people even those just survive on state pension will be drag into tax people on high income will be drag into pay ever high rate of tax the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north make the classic attack on the top earner but of top earner pay of all tax revenue if we simply tax people more and more at the top end of the scale we will get less enterprise less growth and those people will leave the country it be vicious circle and it do not work be incredibly grateful to the father of the house for give way which be characteristically generous think we would both agree that his inspiration and mentor nigel lawson be not hoary old socialist but of course he be the one who equalise the top rate of tax and the rate of capital gain and do not see people flee the country back then the right hon gentleman and could have an argument about history but would still defend my mentor and even more so the prime minister at that time margaret thatcher until the day die and we would just have to disagree on that that be our philosophical foundation could devote my speech to an attack on the labour government there be plenty of ammunition to do so the leader of my party have just give brilliant exposé of their weakness however want to take the debate bit far and not be too party political the british state have fundamental problem member can the criticise the previous government for not have the time or the courage to deal with thing or they could say that we be throw off course by the pandemic there be whole load of reason why we be not able to solve the fundamental problem but believe very strongly that this budget will not solve they either my personal belief be that we have to create an entire new social contract more and more people feel disconnected from the need to work and to take responsibility for their life there be four or perhaps five key failure in the state and do not think that the budget have long term solution for they refer to the national health service the pension service benefit immigration and probably housing and they be all interconnect as successive government have not have the courage to go to the root cause of our failure as state we be gradually fall behind other country pump in more billion of pound this year next year and the year after that will not solve the fundamental problem of the national health service this be huge inefficient state run monopoly that solve its problem with queueing somebody of my age know all about the national health service and have to wait for non urgent operation not just for month but for year and can speak about that with personal experience in lincolnshire nearly six out of people face wait time exceed four hour to be see in in that be increase do the right hon gentleman agree that the investment make today will help reduce those waiting time in lincolnshire well let we see of course we can pump more and more money into this broken system and solve some of the short term problem but soon we will be not just country with an nhs but an nhs with country attach to it be it of total spending that go on the nhs it be grow all the time which mean that as country we be gradually become poor and poor the long term result will be that we will have bad health service say to the hon lady that of course it be totally unacceptable that people wait hour to be treat in and wait month and year for an operation in lincolnshire of people in now have to wait more than four hour four hour can tell the house horror story of my constituent wait up to hour that be not happen in any other develop country it be totally unacceptable surely everyone in this house can unite around the principle that those who have pay into the system for year should be treat with dignity and expeditiously will the right hon member give way must not give way too much because will prevent other people from get in study of develop country show that the uk be in the bottom three when it come to survival rate for common cancer stroke and heart attack lord darzi review find that avoidable death per year be due to long wait in this drag our life expectancy statistic down and down meanwhile even before the budget the nhs be eat up of day to day public spending we be pay more and more and the result be get bad and bad predict that for the rest of this parliament the government will keep on pump more of our national wealth into this fail system and we will still fail to catch up with other country will the right hon member give way no have to keep go accept that some issue such as hospital capacity can only be deal with by spending but we do not need to reinvent the wheel we need to learn from other country the health secretary who admire for his apparent radical zeal although we have not see much evidence of it study australia for instance let break the national taboo on our nhs our religion there be other country that be like ourselves but which deliver much well incomparably superior health outcome it be my personal belief and think be about the only person who have say this year after year that we should adopt australia social insurance model there be nothing wrong with encourage private provision in health be that some great heresy be it some sort of right wing philosophy well it be follow by france germany australia and the netherlands and all those other country produce much well health outcome australia slowly develop hybrid system of state and private health insurance everyone have universal public health insurance but worker be encourage to purchase private health insurance on top of that my point be that with ballooning age population yes we have to spend more on health but we have to get people to put more of their own money into health and they must be assure that have put their money in they will not just end up at the back of queue because they have personal right and be commit to this health service for instance the average cost of treatment only plan for year old in australia be just month and comprehensive cover start at month that cost rise to per month for year old people earn less than can claim rebate to reduce the cost of health insurance and high earner without insurance pay surcharge of between and research commission by australia department of health show that the cost to the taxpayer would be great without the rebate because there would be increase stress on the public system the health outcome be noticeable australia have one of the low rate of avoidable mortality among the develop nation its cancer survival rate be several percentage point high than the uk and stroke and heart attack mortality rate be several point lower it be not perfect of course and not everything can be import from other country but australia system show that there be other model we must have national debate about how with an age population we can produce the kind of health outcome that people desire there be cumulative effect in the australian government debt be of gdp in other word it be run tight well run ship that be country much like we but the uk have already even before this budget reach staggering debt in the same year we be go break because we do not have the courage on either side of the aisle to think from first principle be make this argument as much to those on my own benches as be to the government this situation simply can not go on and on otherwise people will start talk about charge or give tax relief for private health insurance we have to have fundamental debate about the whole structure of health and the health secretary have the good will of people across the house and across the country to start think big and thinking of new idea if he can find way forward and improve health outcome he will go down in history as one of the great health secretaries we have ever have the second fundamental problem we have be the ballooning benefit system particularly when it come to incapacity it be trap more and more people in dependence we need culture of the necessity of work we have million people on incapacity benefit and two third of they recent joiner be claim mental illness the situation be out of control work should always pay more than benefit would have like to have hear more from the chancellor about how she be go to attack the benefit system and incapacity which be gradually reduce the government into penury would the right hon member join in congratulate the chancellor on raise the national living wage an uplift that will have transformative impact on the life of more than third of child live in poverty in gainsborough as well as child live in poverty in my constituency of north warwickshire and bedworth the measure will make such massive difference the hon lady have make her point although be talk about incapacity benefit so be not sure how her point have address mine the culture of people live off the state for year when they be capable of do some work need to be stamp out we have to work together in the house to get people off benefit and help they it be about not just reduce benefit but have innovative scheme like those that the former secretary of state for work and pensions my right hon friend the member for central devon mel stride be try to bring about to encourage people back into work make their whole life well and more productive thirdly tackle benefit be vital ingredient of curb immigration what be the spur for mass immigration it be that health and social care simply can not get enough worker for the salary they be pay there be too many people on benefit and we be drag more and more people from all over the world into our system we need to insist that anyone enter the country earn at least average uk earning we can not go on undercut our native worker with cheap foreign labour we have to pay decent wage in our care service and reform the whole benefit structure so that people actually want to work we can not solve our problem with mass immigration and mass illegal immigration be part of the problem it be gradually destroy the social contract and people belief in the system and the government must have plan to deal with it which basically mean arrest people when they land illegally on these shore and offshore they the other great problem in our national psyche that we have not really address be the whole pension system have to declare an interest be of pensionable age hon member never some member will be very happy when retire from this house but do try to tell the truth accord to my own light and to state difficult truth the fact be that we have more and more elderly people more and more sick people and more and more people with multiple health problem we be all commit to keep the triple lock and would get into awful deep water if say that do so be become increasingly unaffordable but of course if the portion of the state spending devote to pension increase every year in real term we will gradually ensure that the country can not pay its way this be difficult truth that nobody yet have have the courage to address we have to do more to encourage private pension and not say this to the chancellor see private pension pot as convenient thing to raise taxis on many year ago serve on the social security committee under the late great frank field man immensely respect on both side of the aisle we study country like chile that be make explicit the creation of contributory pension system people be encourage to put more into their pension and plan for their old age that be the only way with an age population that we can solve our problem in addition to all this be afraid that wokery and human right legislation be gradually eat away into government member may all laugh but it be true many people feel that they be not part of the way in which this country be run these be just lesson that the government have to learn will the right hon member give way the hon lady have try to intervene again and again so will give way the right hon member mention that many people do not feel part of how the country have be run and for the last year we have see regressive budgets that have hit the poorest hard do he welcome with that our budget be progressive and in fact distribute the burden where it be most well shoulder well if the hon lady think that wish her luck but fear that we be just go to gradually paper over the crack and will criticise my own side in this regard for year ministers go along with the liberal consensus talk about our nhs paper over the crack with more and more money employ more and more nurse and doctor and get bad and bad outcome meanwhile productivity nosedive and mass immigration reach unimaginable height to keep public service go we have to be honest as we be now in opposition welcome the fact that one of our leadership candidate be say that we have to start from first principle that be what be try to do start from first principle on how to recreate the british state that be what mrs thatcher do work for she when she be leader of the opposition in the we need whole new intellectual drive in opposition keith joseph and the institute of economic affairs create new vibrant conservative philosophy for how we could solve the deep seat problem in this country the budget could have be such an opportunity but be afraid it reflect the old tax and spend instinct of the labour party agree with the labour party that housing be great failure of our state of course we need massive house building drive or more appropriately flat building campaign the easy way out be to take good agricultural land and greenbelt land particularly around london instead we need to incentivise building in city and on brownfield site fear have weary the house so will stop now hon member more no doubt these difficult word about the national health service or the triple lock will be use by labour party spokesman for year to come if anybody be interested however hope that we have the intellectual courage to try to solve the real problem in our society how be we go to get decent health service that be on par with what we find in france australia and the netherlands how be we go to get decent housing programme how be we go to get people to contribute more towards their old age unless we address the fundamental deep seat problem in the british state we will just gradually become poor and poor nation it be an honour to follow the father of the house hope not to weary the house with my speech today the chancellor have be extraordinary in her strength and her ability to turn really bad situation into really good one we can not hide from the fact that we have have year of tory government while those on social medium may say oh the labour party be just slag off the tories for the last year those year be the reason decide to stand to be member of parliament have be the parliamentary private secretary to the chancellor when she be the shadow chancellor and have be the shadow whip to the treasury team know the integrity and seriousness with which they will have deal with her first budget the scaremongering of the leader of the opposition pretend to be man of the people really stick in my throat do not know how he have the audacity after year of tory government however the labour party and this labour government have promise change from the failure of the last year and the budget show our commitment to deliver that the scale of the challenge be gargantuan and know that the chancellor have make some tough but necessary decision although inflation have subside to around help to boost household income interest rate be predict to be cut later in the year extend household budget bit more need not remind the house that the inflation reach under the last government today will wear number of hat metaphorically of course be the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee and the chair of the all party parliamentary beer group hon member hear hear it be very important be also the mp for constituency where agriculture play huge role many of my farming constituent and many farmer around the country be concern to hear speculation regard the removal or upheaval of inheritance tax relief include the agricultural property relief and business property relief with many farmer still feel the impact of the loss of direct payment two year of severe flooding high inflation and extremely volatile market condition the industry welcome reassurance from labour last year that agricultural property relief would not be change family farm be the backbone of the industry especially in my constituency of gower farming be in these people blood they do not do it for financial benefit because for many of they there be not much money in it they do it because it be their life and their calling the rate of relief continue for the first million of combine agricultural and business asset to help to protect family farm and business be most welcome but would appreciate an opportunity to discuss with the chancellor the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs or the treasury team how we can ensure that family farm that may come just over the threshold can continue to play their role in our country and how we can support they through the change and avoid any unintended consequence be hopeful that measure in the budget will help the industry by drive ambition and investment investment in our agricultural sector will improve our food security and give farmer confidence in labour government as well as agriculture brewing and hospitality have huge footprint in my constituency and across every united kingdom constituency these sector support million job provide billion in wage and deliver billion of gross value add across the uk economy the brewing and hospitality sector be vital to the economic and social wellbeing of our community across the united kingdom however the industry remain under great deal of pressure post the pandemic support by number of member of the all party parliamentary beer group write to the chancellor highlight key area in which the budget could make positive impact on the brewing and hospitality sector first the industry previously welcome the government pledge to reform the business rate system and welcome today announcement of the chancellor commitment to permanently low business rate multiplier for retail hospitality and leisure property from acknowledge that the drop to relief will cause concern so hope that the chancellor or the secretary of state for business and trade will work with the sector to address those concern secondly the beer and pub sector be one of the high tax sector of the economy in recent year the industry have support the alcohol duty review the cutting of duty on draught product be recognition of the commitment to pub and small brewery again hope that concern around the increase on non draught product in line with rpi will be listen to finally be pleased to hear the chancellor commit to ensure that northern ireland receive its fair share with an extra billion receive through the barnett formula be personally delighted to read that will be give to the executive to support integrate education and furth million will be give to support the vital work of the additional security fund of the police service of northern ireland and the executive programme on paramilitarism and organised crime aside from that concern have be raise with about future funding application for organisation in northern ireland whether about the share prosperity fund the city deal or let we not forget the poor execution of the levelling up fund under the last government community group play such vital role in northern ireland and we must recognise that the shared prosperity fund have be lifeline for many organisation and although it be continue at reduce rate welcome the fact that the budget put aside million for community group in northern ireland the decision on the causeway coast and mid south west city deal be pause during the pre budget spending review so be sure that the people behind those deal will be absolutely delighted with the announcement that they will go ahead be hopeful that the government will work well with our devolved government as we have see the last year have work against the labour government in wales we must have the good outcome for people across the united kingdom the increase in funding through the barnett formula show positive commitment to devolution the budget be difficult but it be necessary it be once in generation budget it will and it must deliver the change that our constituent vote for we will not go backwards we will only go forwards this country need change it be pleasure to follow the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi do not wear quite as many hat as she but it be interesting to hear her perspective on the budget have different perspective my issue with the budget be not the political choice that the chancellor have choose to make clearly she have the mandate to make any change that she wish to make but the fact that it be budget of broken promise to the electorate which be dreadful thing to do for trust in politician will also highlight the economic choice that think the chancellor have get wrong the first break promise be one that the chancellor make during the election campaign when she say time and again that she would not fiddle the figure today she have clearly break that promise she have announce multi billion pound change to the uk borrowing and she announce it overseas not first to parliament know how angry you and mr speaker be about that madam deputy speaker as we all know and as the ifs have say borrowing be not free lunch it will mean that there be more debt and more debt interest spending have not yet have chance to question the office for budget responsibility in detail on its number but from an initial look at its chart the amount of additional borrowing that be announce today by far exceed anything in the mini budget in late the treasury committee will ask the office for budget responsibility about that the second broken promise that the chancellor make during the election campaign be that her plan be fully fund and that she have no plan to raise taxis beyond those list in the manifesto in fact colleague have count that she and the prime minister make that utterance time believe that that promise have be soundly break today and that deliberate political choice have be make to announce the big unforced tax raise budget ever unforced unforced during the election campaign the chancellor tell the british public that taxis be too high she say that she want to bring taxis down she have roundly break that promise today because the budget increase tax for every household in this country possibly by up to over this parliament that be way beyond the figure that we warn about during the election campaign warning that the prime minister say on national television be lie the chancellor campaign on general election strategy that believe be deliberately design to mislead the electorate her plan and those of the deputy prime minister end up give we german taxis with french labour law recipe for high unemployment if ever have see one the scale of the tax change announce today for small business that employ more than four people be astonishing labour members should let that sink in will the hon lady give way will not give way to the hon gentleman who so often give evidence to the treasury committee recall that have to press he on the fact that nhs productivity have not yet return to its pre pandemic level he tell we on the record that if it do that would be worth billion in additional nhs output the chancellor promise that she want to focus on growth that be her mission but believe that more taxis more public spending and more borrowing do not lead to growth if they do venezuela would be one of the most prosperous country on earth what the chancellor be plan all along together with her cabinet colleague who have no experience of work in the wealth create job creating tax pay private sector be budget of the public sector by the public sector for the public sector she can not blame we because in her first day as chancellor she announce billion of additional new spending whether that be for great british energy national wealth fund or inflation bust backdate union pay rise with no productivity requirement also want to speak up for my farmer in west worcestershire will the hon lady give way do the hon gentleman want to stand up for my farmer my farmer be some of the most productive and hard work people in this country they be the one who put food on our table and they be soundly disappoint with today budget there be no help or certainty for they in the budget no help for they through the agricultural property relief that allow they to hand on the family farm to the next generation labour members should know that this budget will mean that many family farm will be break up unable to be hand on to the next generation will the hon lady give way as the hon lady can see be not give way at the moment as you know madam deputy speaker the only way that we get true genuine sustainable growth in this country be through productivity and investment by the private sector will the hon lady give way be not give way at the moment be go to allow more time for other later on rise order the hon lady have make it very clear that she be not give way so please allow she to continue thank you madam deputy speaker anyone who have ever work in business know that they need to increase the productivity of their business and investment in that business be link to its profitability profit that will fall as result of the measure that have be impose on business today when we work out the number think those measure will equate to about on corporation tax this be budget of broken promise that will end up give the british people less growth member do not have to listen to to hear that they can listen to the office for budget responsibility which forecast short term boost to growth but long term reduction in the sustainable growth rate of the british economy thank to the measure that the chancellor outline today in the month since the chancellor take office we have see the evidence we have already see business shut at double the rate they be year ago we be already see plunge in business confidence and we have hear the former chief economist of the bank of england say that the socialist narrative we have have since the election have generate fear and foreboding and uncertainty this be budget of broken promise straightforward breach of promise to the british public and it be dreadful day for the british economy when we go through hansard be sure we will see that the hon member do not mean to accuse another hon member of lie change that term to mislead would have be far more appropriate no doubt the hon member agree with on point of order madam deputy speaker refer to the prime minister word on national television and be quote he directly but if have inadvertently mislead the house apologise thank you so much that be an absolutely appropriate way to respond it be pleasure to follow the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin well remember one of her very early speech when we both come to this place in which she give lecture to this house about the benefit of the laffer curve have also listen to the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh be pleased to report that although milton friedman keith joseph and mrs thatcher may be long go their idea will live on as long as those two member sit on the conservative benches pay tribute to my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi for great speech stand up for her farmer in her rural constituency think she face as chair of the northern ireland affairs committee the same problem that we face in wales we in wales be too heavily dependent on the public sector and there be lack of entrepreneurship which be similar problem to those face in northern ireland but can think of no great champion to stand up for northern ireland than my hon friend thing have change since the last time speak in this house be the member for islwyn and be now the member for caerphilly if you madam deputy speaker and the house will indulge for moment want to pay tribute to my predecessor as the member of parliament for caerphilly wayne david who be doughty champion for his constituency he absolutely love this place and he be one of our great welsh parliamentarian be sure wayne david would join in welcome today the first speech by labour chancellor for year and the very first by female labour chancellor at that for those of we who come in in it be long haul in opposition and be delighted to be stand here today on the government benches britain have live for too long on borrow time borrow money borrow idea we live in too troubled world to be able to promise that in matter of month or even in couple of year that we shall enter the promise land the route be long and hard those word be speak by prime minister james callaghan at the labour party conference in blackpool almost year ago in his analysis lay the blame for britain problem at the door of high government debt high taxation and low productivity the economic ill we suffer today have come upon we over several decade they will not go away in day week or month but they must go away great as our tax burden be it have not keep pace with public spending for decade we have pile deficit upon deficit mortgage our future and our child future for the political gain of the present to continue this long trend be to guarantee move towards tremendous social cultural political and economic upheaval we face hand over toxic legacy to our child and our child child that be how serious the current crisis we face be our challenge in this place in this time be break the cycle that mean those word of callaghan still reflect acutely on the situation we face today we need to get away from two myth that be peddle about the british economy first there be those who believe that sweeping tax cut will as we have hear from opposition members turbocharge the economy without any adverse effect on public service they cite the as global age but taxis could be cut when the government be able to rely on north sea oil money and the privatisation of industry in that be not an option tax cut would only come at the price of cut public service it be lesson we should have learn from the infamous fiscal event of september the experience of most people we speak to whether they be try to book medical appointment or simply renew passport be poor that position be intolerable the second myth be that if we chuck enough money at problem somehow that will solve it as someone who serve on the public accounts committee for five year under my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier who be now the chairman of the treasury committee find that laughable idea take the ajax programme which be mean to provide new armoured vehicle for our army it be initially mean to be deliver in but it be now and it be still not complete meanwhile north of billion of public money have be waste both soldier and the public purse have suffer the consequence of wasteful mess that create unsuitable unsafe and largely unusable vehicle the national audit office call it flawed from the start and note that it be suffer from problem that plague other defence programme the programme be even yet to be deliver and it face the threat of be obsolete despite the mammoth cost to the taxpayer we can not allow system in which regular mistake be the norm and be simply part of the culture we can not have civil servant shrug their shoulder and say that the way it be they be spend public money an estimated billion be lose to fraud relate to scheme from to accord to the national audit office some billion be spend on personal protective equipment that be deem unusable for frontline service welcome the chancellor announcement about the covid corruption commissioner but the fraud should not have happen in the first place most recently hundred of million of pound go down the drain for the fail rwanda scheme whatever we think about such scheme what message do that give to those who be work hard to pay into the system every month and who be ask for more and more of their hard earn money in taxis ronald reagan yes be quote somebody from the right wing once say government be not the solution to our problem government be the problem believe that bad government be the real problem the government can not do everything but they can do some thing well the rise in the minimum wage announce today be one such example however we can not go on this way there be no future in give departments more and more money if it be only go to be waste if there be black hole in department budget the system create that and more money will not change wasteful practice there need to be fundamental reform in the way we manage major project the chancellor announce some productive measure today but if we do not stop money leak out of government through wastefulness and mistake we be fail the taxpayer we must be strict with ourselves when it come to project and government spending we need the chair of the office for value for money announce in july to report annually to the house they must be task with several question about each project be it on time and be it deliver value for money if not if necessary we have to be ruthless we either take the decision to carry on with project that be doom to lose money or we take step back do less but do it well and start create more thing that we can export abroad as the chancellor recognise in her speech we can not borrow indefinitely and we can not keep ask hard work people for more and more while government make costly error and ask the taxpayer to pick up the bill investment to rebuild be necessary and the government be right to protect the most vulnerable from shoulder an increase burden however it be time for root and branch reform of the civil service with realistic economic policy that consider the state of the public finance as they be not as we wish or hope they be be hopeful that the budget have do that today if we do not act now in year time will future generation be speak of the same ailment if they be it mean simply that we have fail and have effect no real change in our time in this place callaghan raise these problem year ago it be our duty to ensure that we do not spend another year stick in that same place call the snp treasury spokesperson four month ago the people take the labour party at its word and vote for change it do not take long for it to become clear that the labour party be offer not change for the well but change for the bad pre election there be no mention of push pensioner in scotland into fuel poverty yet here we be the chancellor say that she would not raise taxis on work people yet we now find due to labour absurdly one dimensional yet infinitely flexible definition of work people that people be in line for five year of fiscal drag on their income and tax allowance the chancellor say that she would not put up national insurance but after the election she qualify that with on employee as she now raid payroll account for charity care home and local business for her national insurance hike during all that where be scottish labour mps where be their howl of indignation defend their scottish constituent and the scottish economy they be silent with mere seven labour mp rebel on the two child cap and not one of they from scotland the national insurance increase be direct assault on scotland business worker and growth plan scotland vital hospitality sector our pub hotel and cafe be already hamstring by brexit and will face an increase burden as result of the change today this punish tax hike will hit many of scotland sme hard the very company that drive growth that reinvest locally that sustain million scottish job and of all private sector turnover in scotland and that sponsor local group and club they be catch in the crosshair of this anti small business labour chancellor like much else raid employment taxis be not in labour manifesto and many ordinary self employ people with modest income from local business they deliver essential economic activity where the capital generate remain local turn an average profit of year and many of they may well have vote labour will fall foul of labour rank duplicity in this change to tax orthodoxy unlike those work for public limited company or the public sector earn six figure salary the national insurance hike with the threshold down to and the rate up to represent billion double whammy tax on job plain and simple the resource that will fund the chancellor raid on payroll be the same resource that business would have use to recruit more people into work reduce unemployment grow their own business and assist in the ambition of great growth in the wide economy the chancellor have just torpedo that it be the same resource that would have deliver pay rise for ordinary work people next year where will that resource come from now the chancellor note that she be not put up taxis on work people and that may technically be true this year but with next year pay claim guarantee to be suppress by her raid on employer ni she be bake in low wage for worker next year and in subsequent year the scotch whisky association have describe the duty on whisky as hammer blow the prime minister promise to back scotch producer to the hilt he should have tell his chancellor because she have just tax scotch whisky to the hilt it be completely unacceptable and it be part of scotland burden none of this be acceptable we be not content to continue foot the bill for decision that we have no part in we go into this election with the high taxis in live memory and they have just go up again ten year ago we be implore to lead the uk not leave the uk and what have we get now we have government benches awash with scottish labour mp while scotland wait with bated breath for just one of they to stand up for their constituent where their interest lie at odd with westminster the scottish labour mp have back the chancellor two child cap snare of our constituent child in poverty and vote to strip the winter fuel payment from scottish pensioner in ours the cold part of this island if that be local labour champion do not fancy meet local labour villain on dark night all of this be justify by the fabled billion black hole with all this black hole hyperbole would like somebody in the treasury to put the light on because it might shine the white light of truth on the black hole that labour fear to mention they include the billion black hole where by rip ourselves out of the eu we have be mortgage to the twin burden of increase administrative cost and the lose opportunity of membership of the world large trading bloc there be the black hole of nuclear energy suck billion from the taxpayer produce the most expensive energy at some time indeterminate in the future and the bank of england billion black hole for quantitative tightening which have not be discuss once in this house welcome the minimum wage it fall short of the scottish living wage but it be start welcome the billion for defence but would be interested to know if any of that be ringfence alarm bell will be ring on farm across scotland about agricultural property relief especially as labour have say consistently it be specifically say by the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs prior to the election that it have no plan to review agricultural allowance it be deeply worrying it be good that budgets will now be annual investment in capital investment should be and that should be floor not ceiling but long term certainty be need for the devolved nation the hon member may have see that the scottish trades union congress have say that for the snp the westminster blame game be finish they have the money they have the power will he acknowledge that this budget end austerity and that the scottish government now have no more excuse for their failure indeed will not accept that will get on to that and to the block grant in particular in just minute if the hon gentleman will bear with for second or two infrastructure be like sport if you do not do it very much you tend not to be very good at it see smart motorway hinkley point and the chancellor claim that there be no return to tory austerity and she be right because this be labour austerity plain and simple it be all the same to scotland though she have call on government departments to make efficiency saving there be literally no precedent for that ever no government have ever achieve that so those efficiency gain will not be realise and those saving will turn into cut the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall ask about the scottish government position we be lead to believe that the block grant be go up by billion clearly that be welcome but let we look at the back story because that be what be important the scottish government now receive low share of uk spending than at any point in the last decade total uk government expenditure have decrease since and scotland share of that expenditure have decrease fast still in the adjusted block grant represent of uk government expenditure however that figure have fall to that attrition represent real term cut to the scottish budget every year since and the scottish block grant be now worth billion less than it be in drop of of course as we always do the scottish government will put the billion to tremendous use but it still leave we billion short of where we be just four year ago that be the problem with this union moreover last year the scottish government capital block grant be cut by real term cut of million and we face further cut from westminster of or million to our capital grant this year that be money not available to build school hospital road and so on in scotland the chancellor do not address that in the budget today we have fresh austerity and fresh cost of living crisis deliver by this labour government hobson choice for scotland in break brexit britain where thing can only get bad nine hundred thousand scottish pensioner will have watch today in the vain hope that the chancellor would turn on her winter fuel payment cut well she finish that hope today the winter fuel payment raid be political choice with the most serious consequence labour own figure show that it could result in excess death this winter and estimate suggest that the cost to the nhs will be just shy of billion and just shy of million in scotland in leaflet that go out across scotland and elsewhere in the uk labour promise to reduce energy bill by instead they have rise by so where be labour saving come from speak to we from manchester the chair of gb energy could not say when any saving would materialise and last night labour move to block any move to put that on statutory footing in the gb energy bill it be head westminster win and tail scotland lose this budget have do nothing to atone for the million uk child live in poverty situation that be far entrench by labour two child cap impact over scottish child over child day fall into poverty with labour two child cap that be child since labour take office in july what record this be know your place budget for child the disabled and those live in poverty it be wait little long budget for waspi woman it be kiss goodbye to your family farm budget it be hand over the money budget if you be in scotch whisky it be show some gratitude budget to scotland to get piece of what be already our to begin with and it be grim reaper budget for the pensioner across these island who will not survive to see another it be pleasure to follow the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan despite his failure to acknowledge that this be the big real term block grant that scotland have ever see from the uk government and his failure to apologise for the mess that his government the snp scottish government have make over the past year for people across scotland it be from the opposition benches in during the budget debate lead by the conservative chancellor of the time that rise to make my maiden speech it feel fitting to speak for the first time since my return to the house in today budget debate follow our first labour budget for many year and from the first female chancellor no less

represent real commitment to protect work family and to reject the damaging austerity measure that have scar our community for far too long we all remember indeed be still live with the effect of austerity cut to vital service job loss and increase hardship for our most vulnerable citizen this budget unequivocally signal that this government be commit to move away from that approach we will not return to the fail economic model of the past year which prioritise cut over care instead we be focus on investment and growth the people of motherwell wishaw and carluke have feel those consequence deeply and it be our responsibility to ensure that we do not return to that path the country vote for change and this budget be all about deliver the solution we need for bright future it

constituency of motherwell wishaw and carluke we on the labour benches campaign loud and clear at the general election for change and that be what have be deliver here today the triple lock be confirm

rise for scot with the increase in the minimum wage and the step take to remove the discrimination against young people who deserve the same wage for the same work the large increase ever for carer allowance and an additional billion for scotland bring our block grant to record level it be now the responsibility of the snp scottish government to put that money to good use madam deputy speaker you and know that those of we in this house be bit unusual political animal be not the norm when speak with my constituent they do not care if it be labour tory or snp politician who put more money in their pocket and fix public service they just want it do so we need no more vanity project and no more money waste on research paper for an independence debate that people be sick of hear about this be real money that can alleviate real problem now do not want my constituent to have to wait until the scottish election in for an improvement in our school and our hospital this money have to get to the frontline immediately and the scottish government will be judge at the ballot box if it do not will finish by say that my welcome back here have be heartfelt and warm from colleague across the house to the doorkeepers and staff across the estate who look after we in this place every day but the one question be ask over and over again be what have change since the last time you be here the truth be that not much have change we still work very much the same way there be perhaps couple of change for last time be here be the baby of the house and now be old enough to be the current holder of that title mum but the one enormous change from the last time be here be that be in government with this labour party labour government there could be no big change and we be just at the start of see the great wave of investment progress and growth that this new government will achieve it be an enormous pleasure to follow the hon member for motherwell wishaw and carluke pamela nash until recently my cousin be minister in carluke let give the house piece of swahili wisdom howezi kuwafukuza swala wawili you can not chase two antelope that however be exactly what the government have be do since they be elect they announce immediately after the election and repeat today that their override priority be to secure economic growth by invest investing investing but in reality their main effort be elsewhere their main effort be create narrative in the public mind that they have inherit wasteland the bad inheritance of any government since kingdom come that the wicked tories have operate scorch earth policy leave absolutely everything break nothing work and huge black hole as consequence thing would have to get bad before they could get well and there would be implication for tax in the forthcoming budget and of course we have discover that today the reality be that investment require an optimistic outlook by pour such bucket of cold water on the british economy what the government achieve be to reverse what be soar business confidence and turn it into absolutely collapse business confidence and business confidence be the key to investment not the great binge of borrow that the government be about to enter into would the right hon gentleman welcome the billion of investment that come through the international investment summit as result of the election of labour government that money have be hold back until the election and the election lead to the investment of those billion of pound be that not sign of significant business confidence in our country much of it reannounce and much of it put at risk by the behaviour of the transport secretary but nevertheless an achievement of course welcome any inward investment what think be huge risk be great borrowing binge for exactly the sort of investment that we see throughout the and which never deliver real investment investment that improve productivity be that which be undertake largely by medium and small firm to invest in their own enterprise but it be crowd out by the increase cost that be entirely consequence of the government great borrowing binge on that basis this budget be disaster it be my great pleasure to speak in this debate respond to the first labour budget in year deliver by the first ever female chancellor of the exchequer congratulate my right hon friend the chancellor on make history today in july the country elect labour to fix the foundation of our country and put we on path towards national renewal and that be what this budget do the chancellor be not duck the big decision or slap stick plaster on the problem instead she be front up to the challenge and take long term decision in the interest of britain my constituent vote for change and with this budget they will see government who be on their side on the side of work people pull up their sleeve to deliver the change that they vote for be delighted to see the prime minister visit birmingham early this week where he set out his desire to put our city at the centre of the government plan for growth grow our economy be the only sustainable way in which to fund the public service on which we all rely thank the chancellor for the many excellent announcement in her speech we have already hear lot of bluster from the opposition play silly game with semantic over the definition of work person but it could not be clear whose side this government be on may remind conservative members that the last parliament be the first in modern history in which living standard fall they leave an economy of high taxis low growth and low wage public service be on the floor and we have have pay more get less doom loop of stagnation and decline under the conservatives the very basic of what one need to live good life safe and affordable place to live money in one pocket and the security of strong public service that be there when need be all rip away first austerity strip more than billion from birmingham over decade then we have the conservatives botch brexit deal finally they crash the economy under liz truss the tory record leave we with slow economic growth nearly million people stick on nhs waiting list housing crisis with people on birmingham housing register crumble school and hospital stagnant wage rise living cost and limited job growth with young people and graduate face few employment opportunity for the job of the future worse still under the last government people lose faith in the fundamental promise of this country that the next generation should do well than the last they lose trust that politician be able to take tough decision for the long term and to put the country before their own political skin the here today go tomorrow culture of broken promise damage people faith in politic but with this budget we can begin the patient work of rebuild our country because we have prime minister and chancellor who understand that we be elect to serve the people of our great country finally have government who be prepared to take tough decision and get on with the job of clean up the mess leave by the conservative party we will invest in our nhs after year of decline we will make fair choice on tax spending and welfare we will protect work people by not increase national insurance the basic high and additional rate of income tax or vat just as we promise we bring record break billion of private investment into britain at our international investment summit this month that be vote of confidence in this government we have million of new investment in battery storage which will create the job of the future in birmingham today the chancellor have confirm change to the fiscal rule to break the low investment low growth cycle under the previous government that be decision to secure britain long term future it will put muscle behind the government industrial strategy so that we can invest in the industry of the future in partnership with the private sector and create revenue to fund the public service that our constituent expect and deserve the question have always be whether to invest or decline the conservatives can choose decline but we choose investment the truth be that the average person in the west midland be poor than they would have be have the economy grow since at the same rate it do under the last labour government that be why heartily welcome the chancellor decision to increase the national minimum wage which provide boost to full time equivalent pay for over people in birmingham alone university hospitals birmingham which be in my constituency be the large trust in the country so thank the chancellor for announce funding to support the delivery of million extra nhs operation scan and appointment year

constituency especially give that more than half of our child centre in birmingham be close under the tories family will be far well off with labour appreciate that the chancellor have have to make some extremely tough choice in this budget to get the public finance back in order the billion black hole be the tip of the iceberg after the last year but it be no less appalling the obr have today reveal an absolutely shocking litany of mismanagement and failure include spend the reserve three time over waste hundred of million of pound on the rwanda gimmick and billion on asylum hotel prop up fail train company and unfunded spending commitment so will the conservatives please spare we some of their faux outrage about tax they raise the tax burden to its high level since the second world war they know full well that public service have to be pay for and they hide the billion black hole from the public how do they expect to pay for that they should have some shame frankly this

the promise of change it be budget that will fix the foundation of our economy invest in our future get the nhs back on its foot and rebuild britain it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill it be also an honour and pleasure after year to be able to rise as free man free to speak on the opposition benches liberate from the tyranny of the whips handout that be be so beautifully read from the labour benches and from the tyranny of desperate ambition to get on to the front bench want to speak today after year on and off the front bench about the state of the public finance shall speak much more in sorrow than in anger not to score party political point but to share reflection on the real depth of the crisis this country face in our structural deficit and the challenge that this chancellor this country and this parliament face in tackle it as former minister for life science for fusion for quantum and for space be delighted to have be elect by think the house to the science innovation and technology committee be also chair of the parliamentary and scientific committee the old all party group and chair of the appg on science and technology in agriculture be also proudly and gladly pleased to declare my entry in the register of members financial interests be try to repair my finance carry too much debt like this country by work with some great british company to help they to raise money in the international market and to grow that be what this country have to do to get itself out of debt as well want to say three thing this afternoon something about the real nature of the crisis in our public finance something about why so deeply believe the innovation economy be the only way to get we out of this doom loop spiral of structural deficit and debt and something about my poor constituent in mid norfolk and the effect of this budget on they tempt though it be to stand up and accuse the labour government of cause all the ill of the world and to take no responsibility for they want to do the opposite and suggest that this parliament and this country have for the last year be fail to grapple seriously enough with the deep nature of structural deficit in our broken public finance remember when be newly elect in have brilliant briefing from robert chote and paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies and have the structural deficit properly explain to that have stay with and it be worth share for the benefit of those listen to this debate traditionally all government in this country tax and spend they earn money every year from tax revenue and then spend it in some year the economic cycle turn down so we do not cut spending we borrow bit to maintain our spending and then repay it when the economic cycle turn occasionally in the cycle we run deficit the structural deficit be that bit of the public finance that mean that even when the economy be grow even when it be grow at or be run deficit because there be bit of the economy that be constantly swallow more money than we be capable of earn when we take office in debt interest be effectively the fourth big department of state we have serious crisis on our hand look back if we be honest new labour do not pay enough attention to deep reform of our public finance during the cool britannia year of gordon brown and tony blair in the crash that government unleash billion of borrowing and quantitative easing we can argue about whether that be the right thing to do but it drive huge asset price inflation and leave we with huge debt the coalition try to get we out of that debt with austerity on which think the country be with we for the first two or three year before feel that we have overdo it yes we have that crash the disruption of brexit terrible once in century pandemic and war in ukraine we have billion of qe billion of pandemic relief and billion of cost of live relief but we have effectively come back to where we be in face structural deficit and flash red light in the public finance call it the bonfire in the basement of the british economy even when the economy be grow even when we see canary wharf on the drive from norfolk the unseen bonfire in the basement eat away at the economy resilience and sustainability that should worry all of we involve in public policy and have sneaking feeling that the public understand this the people speak to on the doorstep during the election be not economist or season political observer but after observe successive government fail their common sense tell they that there be deep problem in the state suggest that much of the political volatility in recent year come from an inability include in my own party to be honest about the scale of the problem think the brexit revolution be drive by deep anger and resentment not just at brussels but at the failure of this country political economy people outside the golden triangle feel leave behind by their own government their own country and their own model of growth the lecture receive in from robert chote and paul johnson be just as relevant today four thing drive the structural deficit the first be debt interest there be an inflation surge because of the war in ukraine but we have be lucky that the market have generally not punish we for borrow too much second be welfare bill the coalition implement very painful reform to stop the rise of the welfare bill we do not cut the welfare budget we just stop its rise third be public sector pension again there be some very painful reform not to cut the cost but to prevent they from boom and bankrupt the public finance those be all significant issue but the big one by far be healthcare the structural cost of healthcare in our age economy with increasingly expensive medicine and an nhs design for the rather than the century be in danger of bankrupt itself and the public finance be on record as say and will repeat it that the health secretary honesty be breath of fresh air the nhs have not be break by lack of tory funding we have all pour money into the nhs but the problem be that the model be not fit for the century much more in sorrow than in anger suggest that we need to start this debate by be profoundly honest about the real nature of the problem the truth be that we can not cut borrow tax or spend our way out of debt crisis and successive government have try and fail speak as card carry supporter of industrial strategy of increase spending and of get the country out of its current spiral and into high growth model want to cheer much of this budget and perhaps there will be more to cheer when we read the red book tomorrow but be worried thank the hon gentleman my fellow member of the science innovation and technology committee for give way he know that funding be vital to drive innovation productivity and future growth and prosperity do he agree that we should welcome the commitment to protect core funding as well as the specific investment in high tech area such as automotive aerospace and clean energy do he agree that the committee look forward to examine the detail of the budget to see its impact on science and technology in every department and across the country thank the hon lady for her intervention and for her chairmanship of our select committee welcome bit of the budget include the billion commitment my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak the former prime minister and secure an historic commitment to raise investment to billion when he be chancellor and hear the government ringfence that amount today support the notion of an industrial strategy as long as that do not involve earnest committee of whitehall mandarin far away from the innovator entrepreneur and people on the ground support the wealth fund and the mansion house reform but have sincere concern about the message that today budget send about innovator entrepreneur wealth creator and business they be the people who turn great science into great business that drive growth let talk about why the innovation economy be key if we want to get out of debt the innovation economy provide the only model of growth that will deliver the productivity increase we so urgently need it will reduce our reliance on the low wage labour that have be completely build into the service economy which have dominate this country since the and since the tony blair and gordon brown year of cool britannia that model be base on let london boom and pull in cheap labour which drive an immigration crisis that my party get itself twist up about and that put huge pressure on our public service we have to get away from that model of growth and move to model of growth lead by innovation with high skilled job much great efficiency and productivity sector be grow in this country that could attract billion of pound of investment from all over the world there be wall of capital to invest in agritech clean tech fusion energy satellite manufacturing could go on and all the sector where we be strong that be the part of the economy that we should focus on and it be the only bit of the economy that drive genuine regeneration the sustainable levelling up be happen in glasgow through the satellite manufacture economy in edinburgh through quantum computing in newcastle through datum in leeds through digital health and in norwich through agritech the economy be the good mechanism for drive that level up and regeneration and create the opportunity society we all need we can not have an innovation economy without an opportunity society would go as far as say that we can not have an opportunity society without an innovation economy that be key if we want to tackle the problem of debt do the hon gentleman agree that support skill and employment be key to create the sort of economic growth he talk about get young people on pathway to training and receive the skill they need to secure job be critical completely agree and the hon lady make an important point be the minister that cover that agenda the science superpower piece be about our be big player in the world attract billion into the country and use our science and research to solve global challenge our science ecosystem be not yet set up to do that that be not even what it think it be there to do the innovation economy piece be about use the science engine to drive economic advantage in this country through the catapult network great industrial investment in skill ensure we train the workforce for tomorrow industry procurement and regulation and support innovation cluster skill be key to that in that context budget be an opportunity but the chancellor have miss the fact that to drive the innovation economy we need entrepreneur innovator and people who will take risk and create business that do not happen in the treasury or dare say it in my beloved old department for science innovation and technology it do not happen in whitehall our job be to create the condition for innovation to flourish fear that the signal that have go out from today budget be that although we have have change of government we have not have change in the core narrative it feel to as though treasury orthodoxy have be reassert we will balance the book by make cut tax exist wealth and chase hard and hard after growth but what we will see be growth down inflation up borrow up mortgage up and tax up we need to send big signal that this country be open for business the hon member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill make an interesting point about the global investment summit which we set up and which be now call the international investment summit it be good news that that money be come in but have to say that in year in the innovation economy have never see so many people decide that they be go to sell their business and leave the country than have over the past three or four month the government think that they be play clever political trick of roll the pitch so that on budget day the news would not be so politically damaging however they have misunderstood how mobile capital and talent be in the global economy we need people to want to come to this country often they want do not to put their child into independent school they want to make money here they want to build business here we need to attract they we have no right to just assume that they will come if we be to build an innovation economy we need tax regime that be fair no one want this to be the home of russian money laundering international criminal and abuse of the non dom system but we have to build an economy that be attractive for innovator we also need to well connect the city to our science research technology and innovation sector it be shocking to and it should be to this house that in of the trillion odd hold in the city our money that be invest in pension go into equity of which go into uk equity that figure today be just under in the past year we have see the most extraordinary globalisation digitalisation and indexation of the city the city have not be encourage by successive government and have not itself be invest actively in the productive business of this country we have see hollowing out in the city of its commitment to support british industry and british company and it be an accelerate model in every month over the past four year we have see net outflow of investment in uk equity hugely support the work that the fantastic parliamentary secretary his majesty treasury the hon member for wycombe emma reynolds be do on take forward our mansion house reform we must well connect our capital in the city of london to our productive innovation economy be not for minute suggest that everyone pension should go into one biotech company quite the opposite but if we connect some of that money with our innovation economy we will unlock ten of billion of private money our money to drive growth in this country at the moment we incubate world class business and then watch the australian and canadian pension fund buy they or american investor buy they out and float they worry about today inheritance tax and capital gain tax announcement we will find that the devil be in the detail when we read the red book tomorrow if we kill the engine that drive the people who create the company of tomorrow we will end up with big science investment and not enough actual innovation in the economy to close want speak briefly about the issue in mid norfolk it be rural sparse disconnected place it be something of backwater in the middle of east anglia with poor traditional access be afraid that today budget will hit the two key group in my constituency many pensioner have be hit by the winter fuel change and huge damage have be inflict on the small business on the high street include the hospitality business and the pub they be look for relief not just penny off beer duty but real relief for business out in rural area the agricultural property relief hit will damage the rural economy of mid norfolk hope that when we read the red book we will see some well news but my fear be that we have change in government but all too little change in our economic orthodoxy just like company this country be run out of cash we need to unlock much more innovative and enterprise model of economic growth today budget be when we start to turn this country around rebuild prosperity and rekindle the belief that thing can get well with this budget we begin to rebuild hope become an economist and then member of parliament to help set budgets in this chamber because what we spend tax and invest determine our future in my teenage year have the privilege of grow up under labour government and see great labour chancellors from this dispatch box deliver budgets that build well britain britain where wage grow where hospital be build and where poverty fall more than that see budget and the creation of country where hope and graft be reward renew and refresh by labour government who deliver on their promise but then become an adult and grow up under conservative government government who cut investment and create no growth economy with the bad fall in wage since napoleonic time who cut home insulation and block clean energy leave we dependent on fossil fuel supply by dictator like putin who block house building so that young people in my generation see house price soar while their wage only fall and who cut defence and weaken our armed force we on the government benches understand that amateur talk tactic and professional talk logistic that be what this conservative government leave we with and give we for my entire adult life until now win the last election mean that this labour government can rebuild our nation prosperity and rebuild country where wage rise and thing do get well with investment in our school so that kid can learn more today and earn more tomorrow investment in our nhs so that temporary illness do not stop we from work permanently investment in clean energy so that we get bill down for good investment in our police so that we can go to the shop without fear and investment in home for my generation mum and dad we love you but it time for the kid to move out rebuild this nation brick by brick be hard and patient work we will not notice how each brick change this country as we do not notice the inch that make up mile but slowly surely certainly as we invest in this nation we will create more prosperous britain where each of we can and will thrive some of we include will measure that progress in number and graph but what we create will be define by so much more country define by hope and pride where tomorrow be well than today and country build by labour government upon budgets deliver by labour chancellor unlike the father of the house the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh have not sit through budgets or however many he mention be far far too young for that but have sit through number of budgets where after change of government chancellors and prime ministers have seek to blacken the people they inherit the economy from when play football we use to call it get your retaliation in first think that we have see bit of that we have it under the last government as well of course for about three year have to listen to george osborne tell we that the previous government have not fix his roof while the sun be shin and suspect that for about the next three year we will have to sit and listen to the black hole that the present government have inherit and so it will go on as people try to justify the situation they find themselves in and indeed some of the failure of government year after year when listen to debate like this suspect that there be point that go over the head of most of the population billion be throw go to spend billion on this and we be go to take billion out of that do not immediately resonate with the population what do resonate as we have see in the last three month be see figure that enable they quickly to identify the impact on they of the policy be introduce suspect one reason that there have be such reaction against the withdrawal of the winter fuel payment be that people can understand they might not understand when the government take billion off departmental budget but they understand when they take off they in the middle of winter when they be struggle with their fuel bill wonder whether the chancellor have learn that lesson already be relieve when she announce that she be not go to increase fuel duty suspect that one of the reason be that she know that an increase would have be easily understand by people who go to petrol station to fill their car up and see another on the price of petrol per litre if she have learn that lesson be glad that cost will not go up for my constituent many of whom live in rural area and depend on their car in northern ireland an awful lot of our supply come in by road one thing be fairly sure of look at the broad picture that the government have try to paint be that the budget and the behaviour of the government in the lead up to it will increase the exist cynicism towards politic and politician during the election the labour party say we have fully fund programme we know what the figure be we not go to increase your taxis then suddenly there be black hole after paint the black hole what do the government do they immediately start spend stack of money they give wage increase set up quango to deliver net zero and spend money on carbon capture and storage billion of pound be suddenly announce against background of we have no money and we go to have to put up taxis labour promise be that no taxis would be impose on work people the government try to wriggle out of that who be these work people who will be affect will not go through all the iteration that there have be of work people the fact be as result of the budget people know that they will pay more tax and their wage will be affect notice labour members shake their head they should look at the report from the office for budget responsibility what prediction do it make it predict that disposable income will fall in real term real earning will be reduce and interest rate on government bond which be already expect to go up will go up far all of which have an impact on people livelihood the government promise that they would not fiddle the figure and would be dead straight with people yet immediately the chancellor talk about it today they have start to redefine borrowing it do not matter what we call borrowing it do not matter whether we put it in one barrel or another at the end of the day borrow money have to be pay back and interest have to be pay on it it do not matter how we classify it it be fiddle the figure to try to pretend that borrowing be not borrow and it have consequence for the economy and for individual there be some thing in the budget that welcome as the chairman of the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group welcome the fact that there will be review of the loan charge it will be interesting to see what its term be they be not outline in the red book we will have to tease that out from the government the all party group would be more than happy to talk about what the term should be and what issue need to be address also welcome the fact that the suspend city deal one of which would have affect the periphery of my constituency have be restore be cynic wonder whether they be stop so that they could be give back and we could all be grateful that we have get something back as result of our lobbying know that there be extensive lobbying by council by the chair of the northern ireland affairs committee the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi whose intervention welcome by the secretary of state and by the political party in northern ireland those city deal be important because as we hear from the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman one way of grow our economy and make it more robust be to spend on research and development and innovation in both city deal there be strong element of research and development and innovation hub and there have already be interest from the private sector because of the money that be go to be spend on they also welcome the additional money under the barnett formula northern ireland have be short change under the funding formula for many year because it be not base on need as it be in other part of the united kingdom note that it will in future be base on need and that welcome change will help the executive in the delivery of public service in northern ireland so many of my constituent have be affect by infected blood now that the funding commitment be there hope that there will be no slowdown in the delivery of that funding to those who have be infect have concern about half of my constituency be rural and make up of small farm the inheritance tax and especially the ending of the agricultural property relief will have huge implication not only do we have small farm but the average age of farmer be so many of they be come to the point where the farm will be pass on they be not cash rich so how will they pay the tax they will simply have to sell the land break up the farm and making be less viable that will have huge impact on the agricultural community in northern ireland the government have make mistake on that it will impact on small farm and food security hope that there will be great examination of that most of our many business in northern ireland be small and medium sized business the government have place further burden on they in the budget not least in the tax on job and the cost of job through national insurance contribution the threshold be lower and the percentage that business will have to pay believe that that will add to the difficulty that business be already experience have already mention this last point the borrowing that the government will undertake will have and be already have an immediate effect on interest rate the obr point out that the yield on government bond be already increase and will continue to increase that will feed through to ordinary mortgage payer and to people who have to borrow money for their business that will in turn have an impact on growth in fact the obr indicate that as the next four year go on growth rate will fall they will be low at the end of this period than they be currently yet this be mean to be budget for growth notice member cheer the government as the chancellor make her announcement today hope that they be still cheer in year time hope that they be still cheer in two year time want to see people cheer do not want to see the country do badly just to make political point but it be important that we be honest about the warn sign and do not build the expectation that this budget will deliver all the good thing that the government talk about we will certainly examine and hold the government to account over future year on whether the policy that they have announce today will deliver what be promise to people rise member will be aware that this debate be very oversubscribed in order that people can help each other be impose an informal seven minute time limit it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson hope that in few year time will be join he in celebrate growth rate that exceed the target objective what tour de force by the new chancellor if only we have have general election back in the summer and autumn of there have never be more important budget in recent year after more than decade of decay this budget must herald decade of renewal as the previous labour government do from to this government must rebuild our country by found strong more diverse and more balanced economy as the chancellor have spell out we will do so by invest in our country grow the economy and attract private investment only then will we be able to restore the public service that the public need and expect this budget sit in stark contrast to the year of failure we have just suffer it take we beyond the absolute poverty the waiting list in our hospital for surgery and cancer treatment the decay in our crumble school the teacher retention crisis and an economy that have be virtually stagnant boast terrible productivity and income inequality those be the dreadful metric of the last government the institute for fiscal studies say that uk economic activity be low than it would have be if it have continue to grow in line with the to trend that be low level than the eurozone or the united states and when measure in term of productivity the late year average of growth in potential gdp per worker be zero the second low level in the past year it be an economy still reel from the event of truss kamikaze budget that send mortgage soar and price skyrocket turn to inequality the uk now have the ninth most unequal income in the oecd wealth inequality be even more glaring with the top fifth of the country own of its wealth while the bottom fifth hold only that do not just impact the amount of money in people pocket it impact the economy too that be why believe we must address the imbalance of regressive flat taxis council tax must be address in the future and be glad that the chancellor have close tax loophole and rebalance the burden of payment place it on those who can afford it at the same time this budget will ensure that hard work pay off by raise the minimum wage welcome this it be strike that many state in the us already pay high relative minimum wage than we in the uk do hard press household face the cost of living crisis will also welcome today budget the fact that we have freeze fuel duty be important as be not have any increase in income tax personal national insurance or vat as well as the penny off the pint those measure will all be welcome by constituent of mine in warwick and leamington however it be through investment that we can grow and rebalance our economy strikingly year of the conservatives economic policy have lead to our have the low level of public and private investment in any economy that be why be proud to be stand on the government side of the house discuss this labour budget because we understand the synergy between invest in people and invest in the economy we have already put billion into sovereign wealth fund we have set up gb energy and we will be establish skills england to ensure we have the skill for the next decade the investment summit few week ago announce billion an extraordinary achievement that investment be desperately need as be point out by gus jim mariana mazzucato and mark carney they argue the case for loosen the fiscal rule state that the current fiscal framework have help to drive this short term think and create an inbuilt bias against investment that point be also support by the international monetary fund for year economist have be call for radical shake up of our economy we need to shift from consumption drive economy to an investment lead one as such welcome the chancellor announcement of support for vital sector such as the energy transition and the automotive industry through the advanced manufacturing plan the opportunity be huge that be why the industrial strategy council be so important so the support announce for green hydrogen gigafactorie the life science and the aerospace sector as well as the billion promise for electric vehicle in the uk be so important we need investment in our school our infrastructure and our nhs be particularly pleased to see the additional investment go into our nhs because we can only become wealthy as nation if we be healthy as nation if we do not address our nhs we will worsen people life but this will also have significant impact on our economy in the number of people economically inactive because of long term sickness rise to over million would love to talk about productivity madam deputy speaker but perhaps will do it another time however london school of economics report last year find that uk productivity be low than that of france germany and the united states that be why we need investment and why we need to address the flexible labour law in this country that have lead or contribute to low than average investment be conscious of time but welcome all the measure that my right hon friend the chancellor have announce particularly on address the issue of business rate which be so important for our town centre up and down the country welcome the investment in local government the additional money for pothole for example but also the support for family carer and child with send this budget be about stability certainty and credibility and about invest in our economy which be so important because above all we need to fix the foundation of our economy the chancellor have set out the plan to deliver that change as be promise to the british people and commend the choice she have make think we have to give credit to the chancellor for budget that in political presentation be very clever the snp have have an absolutely rotten day and the decision to put money into pothole be clever the fuel duty freeze be very welcome especially for those live in rural part of our country but for the big one be of course the off pint off draught beer have work out that it will save over week so be particularly thrill about that sit listen to the number think that this budget be economically illiterate do not know who be do the sum perhaps it be the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott but the sum do not work the market now agree with because just in the last couple of hour we have see very substantial spike in gilt yield we be not yet quite back to the mini budget of but clearly people be say that this be not go to work even more concerning suppose be that the new head of the office for value for money david goldstone serve for many year on the board of which would suggest be the very opposite of value for money on point of order madam deputy speaker hope this point of order will be relevant can you confirm that it be relevant it be relevant madam deputy speaker the hon gentleman mention my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott but have he warn she that he would be mention she in the chamber thank the hon member for the point of order however that be not point of order it be courtesy of the house nice try be just gently tease that be all we hear invest invest invest at the start of the budget statement and think yes that be absolutely what we need not just from the big multinational that come to smart conference but equally from hundred of thousand of people put their own risk capital into start up and new business but no this invest invest invest be go to be do by the chancellor on our behalf not only be she top economist at the bank of england but she be now go to be the fund manager of the nation invest money and try to pick winner would suggest that the last time government attempt to invest money and pick winner back in the it end very badly indeed the hon gentleman talk about investment in our country and in business but just question whether he would prefer to have investment from our government or investment from maybe the russian government maybe one or two member of the house ought simply to grow up but there we be it bit sad have work in private business and do think pick winner be wrong think we leave that to the free market and we let people either make money or lose money frankly if they do their dough well that just the way these thing work any business employ five or more people have be hammer today have set up and run company but nobody on the government front bench have ever work in private business none of they understand what genuine risk capital be from what can make out our business secretary have never even have job have you ever have job have have plenty of job well apart from be in the european parliament which do really count obviously what be dismal about this budget be the growth forecast if the ambition of our chancellor be that in four year time growth should be that be very bad news for everybody particularly because it take no account of the rise in population that will happen through legal immigration it basically mean rise of nobody have even mention the fact that gross domestic product per capita wealth per capita have be fall consistently nearly every quarter for the past two year the big our population become the poor we be become and we must wake up to that reality the big picture be that we be in decline we be get poor there be no billion black hole that be nonsense it be trillion our debt repayment be billion year and from all the figure have see today that will be bad in five year time than it be today we need complete change of culture we need to start say that success be good thing and make money be great thing people become rich be something we should encourage we have to change our culture of work there be this idea oh yes work from home do four day week get your work life balance actually why do we not say to young people that hard work be good thing hard work be the only way that anybody succeed individually and the only way that we will have chance as country to turn any of this around rise no please sit down honestly you ve have go we be in much deep trouble than anybody on either front bench dare to admit that be reality we should all face we have labour party that could not define what woman be or what work person be and after today be pretty convinced that it can not define what economic growth be would like to say it be pleasure to follow the hon member for clacton nigel farage but honesty forbid and will move on this be long await budget in wales we have wait year for budget from labour government in westminster who will finally work with not against the senedd in cardiff and provide support for the people of wales be so proud that this be the first budget to be deliver by female chancellor the first female chancellor ever in the uk that be fantastic and be proud to have be able to listen to she deliver her speech since be first elect back in hundred of constituent have email and write to about the effect of previous conservative budgets most noticeably after the disastrous mini budget by the former prime minister liz truss and kwasi kwarteng the fail chancellor one constituent write to everyday be become struggle another person have be live off less than over the weekend and come into my office say that they be very low on food and overdrawn as members of parliament where we be able to help we do but too often we have reach the end of what support we can offer too soon welcome this budget which will help work people after year of constant deterioration in their living standard we must be under no illusion the budgets of past government be budgets to enrich the rich and to impoverish ordinary people not help they the situation that this labour government inherit as result be not one that we want but it be the one we be leave with we be face with this black hole and we must face up to it this new labour government promise change from the failure of the past year and this budget confirm our commitment to do just that the government have already take step to fix the foundation of the economy by shift power towards work people with the employment rights bill by address the rail rip off by bring train company into public ownership and by introduce bill to combat the tory sewage crisis the conservatives crash the economy send mortgage through the roof they waste billion of pound of taxpayer money on their fail asylum system prop up private rail company that be not deliver and facilitate dodgy covid contract leave the billion black hole in the nation finance and public service on their knee let we not forget that the billion be recur amount so it need to be address right away we can not afford to wait any long after all their dither and delay the conservatives call an election and then run away all of that mean there be choice to be make the first choice that this government have have to make be to be open and honest with the electorate all of we have feel the effect of year of tory government they be evident in every aspect of our life as my right hon friend the chancellor have make clear today the true scale of the problem do not become clear until very recently when she actually have the key to no the second choice that this government have have to make be to be responsible in how to go about fill the billion black hole create by the tories the third choice be to truly acknowledge the parlous state of our public service and the scale of work that must be do to address that crumble building poor staff morale and recruitment and retention problem be present throughout our whole public sector school hospital and the brilliant people who sustain our education and health system be cry out for the investment they need and deserve after year of austerity combine with post covid inflation crisis we have see decline in living standard and soar cost of living all while private profit increase and the wealthy become wealthy still the prime minister be therefore right to insist that tax rise should not be levy on work people but that those with the broad shoulder should bear the cost the very wealthy and the large corporation that have register soar profit as we promise in our manifesto we will not raise national insurance vat or income tax just as we pledge in the election campaign labour will protect work people people like my constituent in newport west and islwyn this budget have deliver for wales for the first time in generation wales vote for change at the general election and change have begin by sustainably invest in wales future as chair of the welsh affairs committee welcome the billion of new money for wales through the barnett formula and through direct spending most notably welcome the substantial increase in barnett consequential for the welsh labour government to put towards day to day spending on public service such as the nhs welcome the money to support steel community both through the transition board and by protect the levelling up funding in port talbot and elsewhere welcome the million to make coal tip safe be so glad that our government have step in so quickly to do that important work welcome the million in funding for community across wales and investment zone to drive economic growth welcome the money for rail project with the promise of sustainably fund future in wales we be see the large real term settlement since devolution begin in labour be create the condition for long term economic growth so that people can finally enjoy the proceed of their hard work and see an actual increase in living standard change have begin with this budget this labour government be invest in britain future so that we can protect work people fix the nhs and rebuild our country this budget show the difference that have two labour government work together make for wales thank the chancellor for her drive determination and honesty and look forward to she remain in her post for many year to come it be with sadness that rise to speak in this debate on the budget of broken promise during the election campaign hear from many constituent about how they feel regard their disillusionment with our political system they feel that westminster seem to talk only about itself do not represent they and at time treat they like fool this budget damage our democracy in the contempt with which it treat our voter for the past few month my constituent have be hear from the government that everything be go to be awful and this be go to be punishment budget and they have be await it with trepidation they have hear that when the labour party come into power it discover thing it be not expect so it have to announce winter fuel payment cut despite the fact that it have be talk about do so in this place for some time labour have say that it have to make difficult decision but that it will stick to all its promise but turn out that it can pull out various loophole that it have carefully weave into its manifesto that be one of the reason why over the past few week we have see this incredible debate about what work person be which so far have be pure and utter sophistry it appear that that be what so much of this budget debate turn on so what be work person certainly would say be work person people here be work people for the most part the majority of my constituent be work people or have be until they start claim pension and that need to be respect since the chancellor say that there would be no tax rise on work people this question have lead to great degree of confusion as we go through the budget be business owner or someone who work as tradesman not work person ironically labour say it want to fix the foundation of the country but wonder where it be go to get the tradespeople to do so how about people who save for their future be they not work people how about our pensioner have they not be work people how about people who use the bus be they not work people thankfully today get an email from the tuc which help clarify who work people be it point out that the tuc be the one who represent work people think our constituent all know that unless they be trade union member or someone who be dependent on the state the labour party do not think they be work person and it be come for they interruption well look at the tax rise when government member start digest the budget when they look at the impact of an extremely low growth rate over the next few year the impact on farmer who will struggle to pass on their farm and the impact on small business which we depend on for growth investment and prosperity they will regret what have be say today be sad that the south east and surrey be not really mention interruption labour members laugh but they would do well to consider that surrey be the big net contributor to the treasury outside london the chancellor would do well to listen to surrey mps about the investment that we need in local infrastructure so that we can continue to provide money to the economy for the ambition of we all in my constituency that mean confirmation of support for the weybridge health centre rebuild fix our level crossing and motorway and rebuild the magna carta school the government have an opportunity with this budget and they have miss it they have choose duplicity over delivery politic over pragmatism and sophistry over service it be an honour to follow the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer but may urge some humility give the number of repossession that my constituent in bradford west experience after budget that he support which lead to run on the pound it be not that long ago that repossession increase mortgage go up and people be suffer the party over there think it be quite good to you know food bank have become food porn that happen under his government watch so maybe there be need for little bit of humility let say thank you to the chancellor the first female chancellor to stand in this chamber for deliver today landmark budget have wait more than budgets for one from the labour benches it be heartwarme after nine year in opposition have to fight for the basic like school meal for child and have footballer campaign for it it be an embarrassment for we as country when austerity be political choice that the conservatives make when they be in government it be lovely to see the grown up back in charge deliver budget for the work people of great britain there must be no doubt that the chancellor task to deliver that be extremely difficult give the reality of the public finance that we inherit from the conservatives today the chancellor put forward plan to turn the tide she have deliver budget that will put money back into the pocket of work people it be budget that will not only save the nhs but ensure that it remain the pride of our public service for generation to come it be budget that provide for our child and school give they the education they deserve for bright future it be budget that invest in infrastructure to rebuild britain from the moment the coalition be form follow the general election in may the then prime minister david cameron state that his first priority be to reduce the deficit and restore economic growth well how do that work out let remind the house by the end of the conservative era both those priority have fail uk gdp be now billion less than expect in the obr growth rate forecast when the conservatives take office in when it come to wage from to earning grow at probably the slow rate in more than year for my constituent in bradford this budget provide we with infrastructure investment which be really grateful for huge boost that we need therefore welcome the chancellor announcement today of funding for upgrade to bradford forster square station and investment in mass transit system for the bradford tramline which will redefine the urban journey from bradford city centre to leeds city centre that will improve public space drive economic growth and ensure fast and more reliable access to essential destination while link key community in between will be speak to the chancellor and the secretary of state for transport on the fine detail but this infrastructure investment be need for bradford to drive our economic growth on the flip side what happen with the conservatives time and again in the statement sit through they promise northern powerhouse rail and to unlock growth they promise to level up and all they do be level down level down level down now we have the chance to fix all those issue and what they do wrong our chancellor and our government have difficult choice because of tory failure but today they deliver they deliver pay rise for million worker the big increase in carer allowance since its introduction and billion increase in core school budget they deliver budget that triple free school breakfast add billion in funding for special educational need and disability and billion for the school rebuilding programme to provide our child with the school building they need to thrive in education they deliver to protect the nhs with an extra billion for day to day spending in the nhs billion over two year to cut waiting time and extra elective appointment week manifesto promise make true and deliver today people can have the care and the health protection in the nhs that they deserve this be unashamedly budget for work family and work people put money in the pocket of the very people who have be let down by year of conservative rule welcome this budget and be pleased to see the positive impact it will have on my constituent across bradford west diolch dirprwy lefarydd today the chancellor have the opportunity for transformative change but she decide to give with one hand and take with another plaid cymru recognise the terrible financial legacy inherit from the conservatives but this be not the way to fix it there be no fair funding formula for wales no sign of the billion worth of high speed consequential owe to wales no devolution of the crown estate and no turn on the winter fuel allowance or an end to the cruel two child benefit cap the government could have try to spread the pain with big contribution by the very rich through wealth tax for example instead the increase to national insurance will punish business and make it hard for they to create well pay job the budget document suggest that there be an allowance for public sector organisation would appreciate some clarity from the minister as to what that allowance entail and what constitute public sector organisation crucially austerity will continue for some of the most vulnerable in our society through fail to help the pensioner in wales to keep warm this winter and refuse to bring an end to the two child cap in wales where third of our child live in poverty there be little in the budget that fix the foundation for wales the uplift to the block grant will not rebalance wales fiscal settlement welsh council alone face million budget gap in be afraid that the change to rule on inheritance will seriously threaten welsh family farm which be the backbone of our rural economy in opposition the labour party support plaid cymru call for the billion owe to wales in rail fund it criticise the previous government for fail to give clarity on the wylfa project in my constituency yet in government it be repeat the same error we welcome that westminster be finally begin to address coal tip safety this be long stand issue that pre date devolution this be an important first step in tackle its environmental impact but community will continue to suffer without meaningful effort to create job and prosperity urge both the welsh and uk government to develop strategy that not only address safety and environmental concern but breathe life into local economy that would be true last co operation plaid cymru will scrutinise every line of labour budget because wales deserve more than broken promise we demand fair deal very much welcome the chancellor budget it be landmark budget not just because it be the first labour budget in year and the first budget from woman chancellor in over year but because as the father of the house the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh reference of the intellectual change it represent in that change we be look to enact significant shift in the mindset of budgets from no can do britain to can do britain britain where we believe that investing be not simply waste but an un blocker for private sector dynamism and investment of the kind that we so desperately need in cornwall welcome the commitment from the minister for industry my hon friend the member for croydon west sarah jones to join roundtable in the new year to meet the most promising industry in cornwall be also delighted that our call for structural funding in the form of share prosperity funding have be honour by the government particularly give the willingness of the previous government to throw we under bus ship young people on their not so merry way to hare brain national service scheme only wish that more conservative members from the previous government be sit on the opposition benches to debate this landmark budget with this evening it be through the national wealth fund and gb energy that we will be able to mobilise billion of pound of private finance de risk investment to support critical infrastructure project include in cornwall which will turbocharge the green economy and propel our country into the future our labour government will make sure we invest every penny of taxpayer money responsibly prioritise our public service and ensure that economic stability remain at the heart of decision making and protect work people from preventable economic shock such as those we have see we be drive forward the green industrial revolution at home in cornwall and be committed to ensure that the spoil be spread among the community our investment in skill and infrastructure will empower local people and open up those opportunity for growth and innovation rise this government be actually make quite brief speech but appreciate the eagerness of colleague to lend their remark to this landmark budget debate interruption thank those sit on the front bench this government budget signal clear departure from the short termism and sticking plaster politic of the last year they be commit to take long term decision to fix the fragile foundation of this country and secure prosperous future for all for st austell and newquay and the clay country that mean not just recovery but real chance to thrive ensure that our community be at the forefront of this transformation and benefit from bright more prosperous future do not know whether you like be fan of yes minister madam deputy speaker but if you be you may remember the first ever episode of what be suppose to be sitcom in the episode call open government sir humphrey start by explain to bernard dispose of the difficult stuff in the title it will do far less harm in the title than in the actual report that seem to be lesson that the chancellor of the exchequer have take to heart while we see any number of poster slogan sign and report with growth in the title it even pop up once or twice in the chancellor speech there be virtually nothing in today budget statement or in the hundred of page of documentation that the treasury have publish today that will actually lead to growth in our economy and there be almost nothing in the king speech that could deliver the meaningful growth that the economy clearly need with every hour that pass it become clear that the chancellor promise have not be deliver and that there be very wide gap between what be promise and the hope that be raise before the election and what we have see both in the legislative programme and in the first budget in year as have be say to be present by this chancellor of the exchequer the problem be not the black hole that the chancellor claim to have find but whose existence the obr economic and fiscal outlook report do not support the problem be not that hole but the enormous gap the chasm between what the chancellor and the prime minister promise in opposition and before the election and what they be now deliver for our constituent with every hour that go by people be see that they be sell false prospectus on that growth the obr report make it absolutely clear that while it expect temporary boost to gdp in the short term there will probably be some crowd out of private activity in the medium term that be why the obr forecast that the measure in the budget will not raise growth but will cut growth in and this be an anti growth budget we be look to the chancellor to announce measure to support growth locally in our constituency where be the certainty when it come to the levelling up fund that our community be promise where be the certainty when it come to the long term plan for town that our community be promise the plan that in my previous constituency before the election work so hard with local stakeholder local council and the combine authority to help to secure the new boundary mean that those project be no long in my constituency but in those of labour members of parliament although it have be point out repeatedly that people vote for change the people of brierley hill do not vote to lose next generation vehicle technology centre that would deliver the new skill that the community need the people of dudley do not vote to lose million of long term investment from the town fund which would make such difference to the community my hon friend be give powerful speech on this budget of broken promise people in dudley and elsewhere do not vote for this labour government to put up taxis on work people yet the obr have say today that of the cost of the rise in national insurance contribution will come out of ordinary work people wage do he agree that they be rightly angry about that and will get angry still when they understand the implication my right hon friend be absolutely spot on we do not need to take his word for it definitive though it be the chancellor herself be clear that many of the tax rise that she have introduce today be taxis on job and can only find their way out of people pay packet people be sell false prospectus on our national finance before the election the then shadow chancellor promise that labour would be the party of fiscal responsibility and that she would have iron discipline well at least gordon brown be faithful to prudence for full term it look as though fiscal responsibility have be jilt at the altar by the chancellor within her first few month page of the obr outlook make it clear that the measure in this budget will increase borrowing by billion over the course of this parliament if the hon gentleman think that taxis on business should not increase where should the tax burden lie if he do not think that borrowing should increase what would he cut from the budget we have yet to see the departmental allocation it be clear in the obr projection that there be massive increase in borrowing but even the savage tax rise that have be set out today be dwarf by the increase in spending the choice that the chancellor have make be not to do with any black hole they have be make because of her priority which be set out before the election people be tell that taxis would not have to rise under labour government but they be now see the reality the current budget deficit will increase by billion year notice that the hon member still have numerous piece of paper in front of he so hope that he be come to this point the chancellor stand up today and make choice for the future of the country we can agree or disagree with the choice that have be make but be not hear from any conservative members what alternative choice they would make the chancellor and the prime minister make it very clear to voter that nothing in labour plan would require tax rise other than very specific tax rise that they have indicate they say that they be not look to raise taxis on business work people and farmer which be dismiss as lie in the television debate we now see that the claim make during the election campaign be untrue only inasmuch as the leader of the opposition and shadow chancellor hugely underestimate how much the labour government would hike people taxis again false prospectus be sell page of the obr outlook set out that earning growth will halve over the course of this parliament this be betrayal of work people it be the tax on job that the chancellor be so keen to attack while in opposition the increase in business rate will add to the bill for typical pub at time when so many be only just manage per worker the increase in national insurance contribution for business will add will the hon gentleman give way be get glance from madam deputy speaker to suggest that ought to be wind up the cost be proportionately much high for those who employ part time worker on modest income as my hon friend the member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin have say we be see french labour law and german taxis and fear that will lead to spanish unemployment rate this budget be damaging for growth for national finance for small business and work people and for farming in our rural community it be smoke and mirror it be the fiscal equivalent of the people on westminster bridge who invite tourist to put money on find the lady it be budget that be hide behind semantic sophistry and small print it be bad for the country and the soon that it can be reverse the well it be privilege to speak in this historic budget and on this historic day and start by congratulate my right hon friend the chancellor and the treasury team for year the people of the vale of glamorgan and this country have carry the weight of hope pen up inside today the chancellor have weigh up their hope look they in the eye and lift they for that congratulate she and the entire treasury team government be suppose to be the mean by which ordinary people exercise their collective agency to shape our community for year the conservatives deny ordinary people their voice they deny we collective agency and sense of hope in our community per worker productivity growth in the past decade be the weak on average since that be the bad foundation for share prosperity public service be on their knee that be the bad foundation for shared dignity our army have shrink and our prison be burst that be the bad foundation for shared security and through it all we have have the double whammy of high borrowing rate and low nominal growth through which they punch into our weak foundation furth billion fiscal black hole as side note it be astonishing to that the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood talk about fiscal responsibility and semantic do not think he be rise and talk about that during the sharp spike in overnight gilt yield this country have see in the century this be national embarrassment for the conservatives they should be stand here and apologise they should be point the finger down as they ought to have be do at the time and apologise for what they be do but see no contrition on that side of the house there be those who ask why we talk about the billion black hole the conservatives leave and why we dwell on the past do so because if we be to grip the urgency of where we must go we have to know where we have come from even more amid the bad foundation for prosperity dignity and security and the final punch of their fiscal black hole there be deep inheritance which be one of diminished trust and diminish hope that we can get out of their hole that be why the chancellor budget be not just good for our economy but essential for my community in the vale of glamorgan it say with strong conviction that be they this be now we it be the voice of ordinary people express in our collective agency foundation that be wreck by they will now be fix by we the obr that be trash by they and be still be trash by they will be affirm by we investment in our future our health and our job that be structurally slash by they will be regain by we the hon gentleman talk about investment for our future what be he go to say to the farmer of the vale of glamorgan who fear that they will no long be able to pass on their farm to the next generation as each generation before they have be able to do until this black day of broken promise in this budget will say to they what say during the campaign which be that see the pain inflict on they over the past year the fact be that the animal welfare and environmental standard of our proud welsh and british farm be sell down the river in trade deal negotiate by conservative ministers while the right hon gentleman laugh along it be absolutely unacceptable that be what will say to they and will confirm that we will not allow any of it to happen again structural investment in our future be slash by the conservatives but it have be restore by we borrowing rate shoot up under they include the big overnight spike in short term gilt in the century but they have be bring back to par with the united states by we the market be decry as conspiracist by they but those same market now hail the return of british fiscal credibility due to we wales be deny voice by they but it be now front and centre again thank to this budget and this government real wage be squeeze by they but the national living wage be now rise again fuel duty have be freeze carer allowance have be increase and much to my heart delight have be take off the price of pint in pub in vale of glamorgan and across the country at the heart of it trust the most critical foundation of my community rip up by they and now brick by brick rebuild by we rise remind member that we be push for time so be impose an immediate five minute time limit it be so inspiring for woman and girl across the country to have hear the first female chancellor deliver her budget today as liberal democrats we will always welcome those part of the budget that aim to take the nhs off life support after so many year of under investment by the last conservative government it be good to hear those commitment today if we be to fix the nhs and bring down the disastrous treatment and appointment backlog that be cause incredible suffering to constituent across the country we need not only to repair hospital with crumble roof but to build new one and urgently because progress have be far too slow we all know that the new hospital programme be ambitious but sadly the conservatives fail originally new hospital be promise by but not one of they have yet open in cruel irony we find ourselves with backlog of hospital wait to be build with no assurance in this budget on how many will be fund in my constituency the cutting edge cambridge cancer hospital with its great ambition to change the story of cancer forever will offer lifesave treatment to patient across the east of england include hope my husband what really set it apart be that in the same building alongside the patient and their medical team academic and industry researcher will focus on deliver groundbreake early detection and innovation that will transform the life of million of cancer patient not just in cambridgeshire and the east of england but worldwide however this new hospital be trap in uncertainty despite have have full business case approve planning permission grant and spade in the ground this essential hospital be on hold every day that we wait for the final green light the cost escalate not only the cost of the building but potentially at the cost of human life too the government have place these hospital that be promise in under review because despite their promise the conservatives never allocate the necessary funding we wait with bated breath for the final decision which be now set for january have the pleasure of meet the secretary of state for health and social care to discuss the situation face the cambridge cancer hospital in my constituency receive assurance that fund to support the cost of the contractor be still be pay will the chancellor commit finally to allocate the funding necessary for the cambridge cancer research hospital so that the promise to all those in the east of england and beyond who be desperate for groundbreake lifesave cancer treatment be not break once again although it be disappointing that the conservative benches be almost empty it give great pleasure to welcome the first labour budget in more than year be delighted that the chancellor herself visit mansfield she clearly listen to the concern of my constituent because many of the thing local people have be say they want to see be announce in the budget this afternoon during my election campaign set out mandate of five mission to deliver as part of my commitment to help the people of mansfield and warsop it be refreshing that today budget will enable to deliver on those mission alongside the national mission we have as government nottinghamshire have previously hold the accolade of be the bad place for pothole in the uk my constituent regularly contact in exasperation about the state of the road in mansfield after eight year of failure from the tories in county hall the people of mansfield will therefore welcome the news that we be invest almost billion more to maintain and renew the nation road enable we to go even far than the previous government commitment to fix an additional million pothole across england each year look forward to work with ministers to ensure nottinghamshire get its fair share of that funding my resident in mansfield report to their experience of the am scramble for gp appointment they want more investment to rebuild our nhs and to cut waiting time be glad we make progress today towards deal with the mess leave by the previous government know those mansfield resident will welcome the chancellor announcement of more than billion increase in the day to day health budget help to deliver our manifesto commitment to fund extra hospital appointment week increase capacity for ten of thousand more procedure next year and deliver new capacity for over million additional diagnostic test local people want to see we fix our break housing market for both buyer and renter the million boost to the affordable home programme will help local authority and housing association visitor to our town centre want we to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour know the people of mansfield will welcome today announcement to increase the core government grant for police force my final focus be to see we create the condition for stable and grow economy that benefit the prosperity of people in mansfield and warsop the chancellor clearly understand that with the announcement of an additional million for further education by transform the apprenticeship levy into growth and skill levy look forward to collaborate with my colleague in government to deliver the benefit of that package for mansfield stability ensure energy security protect household budget and give my local business the confidence to invest in people stability mean that instead of worry about political infighting and jump from one crisis to the next we can invest in our public service that be what the people of mansfield send here to deliver on so be very pleased that our first budget be protect work people we be choose to ask the wealthy and business to pay their fair share while ensure that work people will not face high taxis in their payslip the conservative party wreck the economy today we be fix the foundation and begin the work of rebuild it that be why be so proud to be part of this new government to support they and to support this budget many member have welcome aspect of today budget and do too especially the additional funding for the nhs and for school rebuilding in the face of the reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete crisis however the impact on small farm that be slightly large than the million threshold will be devastating and will see family own farm in my constituency and no doubt across the uk sell out to big business as inheritance tax literally tear they apart urge the government to think again on that before it break up family farm threaten food security and destroy community be not surprised to see the conservative benches so empty as we come to scrutinise their economic record people understand that our inheritance from the previous government be not one of poor delivery or of an economic downturn but be one of national decline everywhere we look in this country thing simply do not work people understand that because they live it every single day of their life disagree little with our front bench team in its analysis of the tories record on growth there be record on growth that the tories deserve to have their name attach to the number of food parcel give out in this country grow to million the number of worker on zero hour contract grow to more than million the number of patient on waiting list grow threefold the number of people have to pay for private treatment reach almost million the average heating bill grow by more than the problem grow and grow under the previous government and the response become small and small they shrink from the challenge refuse even to acknowledge the problem and even hide it in their own budget number of hon member have fondly mention alistair darling today everyone who know he and who be friend with he will be think about he today the bad insult that alistair have for someone be that they be not serious the right hon and gallant member for new forest west sir desmond swayne impress the house by quote some swahili my swahili be learn from the lion king that idea of hakuna matata sum up the whole economic attitude of the previous government it be clear from listen to conservatives today that if the voter have not intervene they would have keep on for year after year with cut under investment and austerity thank goodness that we have serious leadership again and budget that move we on from that fail project there will be debate about how public debt be register within the public finance but these be not technical detail that we take such strict view of investment in this country be why we have so few scanner in hospital why kid in my constituency spend their whole childhood in crowded home why family be wait for social housing and why kid be in classroom that should have be rebuild what relief it be to see that investment today in my constituency of east renfrewshire welcome the investment in hydrogen build on the advantage that we already have there value be as other have say about choice we have see the choice of the opposition they choose to stand with the who pay capital gain tax over the who do not with the of the population who be non dom over those who be not and with the private jet setter over the mass if they oppose the revenue raiser they be also set themselves against the spending and investment speak of be serious as scottish mp be delighted that the adult be in charge here although the clown be still in charge of the circus in st andrew house and it be not surprising that snp members be not here today with the large ever settlement of the devolution era they be leave naked the last fig leaf cover their embarrassment be go their own inadequacy be expose and what it lay bare be not very impressive today offer the chance for scotland to deliver change base on the investment that have be make available by labour but it can not go down the same drain that everything else have in scotland this budget offer the opportunity to grow the economy income and industry but there be something else stir today that other hon member have mention and it be an unfamiliar feeling we can begin to hope again we can begin to hope to feel proud and to look forward to the future of our country once again praise my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall for his speech and for his reference to alistair darling who would indeed think that not be serious be the bad thing that could possibly happen but he also would have have his definition of seriousness which would be say that on day when we have huge budget like this and people will be spend their time go through all the weed promise you madam deputy speaker it be sorely tempting we should focus on the big picture choice that have be make because those be the choice that will define not just this budget but this parliament and this government will touch on two of those choice today first the choice that the state of the public finance and public service can not continue as it be today and secondly the choice that we can not continue to be country live off our past rather than invest in our future those be the choice of this budget and the fact that opposition member be not in their place show that they do not know what their choice be and they do not have answer to those question let turn first to the public finance and public service we all live in part of the country where people be not get the operation they need where crime be not be investigate and where prison be overflow and do not have the place we need they to in order to turn that situation around tax rise be inevitable and we will start to do that through the tough but fair choice set out by the chancellor today several opposition members have suggest that our position on the public finance be loose perspective but the truth be that the fiscal rule we have set on current spending today relate to target that be not meet once not in one single year under the previous conservative government think most opposition member know that public service be not sustainable and that they leave the public finance in bad shape the peak of austerity be back in and they know then that it could not be sustain politically or indeed socially because they promise to bring austerity to an end but it have not feel like austerity have be bring to an end yes that be partly due to difficult circumstance from covid to the cost surge on energy but it be also because the previous government be distract promise tax cut while deliver tax rise invite all hon member to turn to chart in the obr document to recognise that the tax rise put in place by the previous government be much large than the tax rise that have have to be announce regrettably by the chancellor today if tax rise be the death of growth the tax rise that the country be live with be tory tax rise this be not just about tax the previous government be also promise public service improvement without allocate the public spending to make they reality as the obr have lay out clear and bare today we all know the result public service be bad today than they be in and the spending plan we inherit would have make they bad still with in every cut from day to day public service spending none of we think that be possible so we have make different choice we have choose to take tough but fair choice on tax and to put in the spending that be need include billion for wales let turn to the second choice that outline at the start of my speech the choice to invest we can not carry on live off our past rather than invest in our future and even if that be ever an option it be not today after we have do so for three long decade the previous government be plan cut of third in net investment over billion year why yes because politic of all stripe have short termist incentive but also because for too long our macroeconomic framework have have heavy bias against investment spending build in fiscal rule have drive cut whenever bad news have arrive which drive problem in the volume of investment the average oecd country have invest more than we this century and in the volatility of investment that be what the previous government be plan and that weak investment undermine growth it have be say lot today that business will not like every measure in the budget and it may not but we need to be clear that business investment in britain have be low than in every other economy in previous year why because of lack of stability from liz truss to boris johnson because thing can not be build because we can not get the worker because we have run down the nhs and people be too sick to work it be true that this be big budget and there be big choice that we have to recognise how do we deliver stable public finance how do we deliver function public service how do we deliver an investment programme that underpin growth rather than undermine it we should all agree that those be the question face the country and the tories lose the election because they do not even try to answer they on the basis of today they be still not try the chancellor have answer all three with tough but fair choice not easy answer but new direction for britain too rather than get lose in the weed will take step back because we in this country today like ally over the atlantic and across the channel be reckon with turbulent force of change technological transformation age society the destruction of our natural world vast inequality of wealth and power and mass migration across the globe ours be an age of insecurity and uncertainty moment when grasp the opportunity before we require choice such as whose side we be on which industry will power growth what friction we will permit in pursuit of security and which partner we will embrace around the world today the chancellor have make choice what underpin those choice be simple but powerful point because the challenge of this age be immense the solution must be equally bold turbulent age require the confidence to stand tall square up to what be not work and ensure that we reform what be not deliver for the people of this country the chancellor choice demonstrate that commitment reckon with the magnitude of the challenge that the country face first the chancellor choose investment sometimes wonder whether conservative members could benefit from more time to think through what they be really for and why because to oppose the change that she have make today be to welcome the apathy and defeatism that say that decline be inevitable certain mental attitude appear to have grip conservative member it be too hard there be too many barrier it can not be do by oppose the revolution in investment that the chancellor unleash today conservative members have firmly put themselves on the side of the naysayer and those who would lie still while britain decline not we not labour members will the hon member give way will make some progress secondly the chancellor choose who the government will stand beside by raise taxis tax asset wealth and those who can afford it protect work people and follow my predecessor ian mccartney in raise the minimum wage from which of my constituent will benefit will the hon member give way no will not labour member be proud that alongside the make work pay package the government be deliver generational shift in wealth and power towards worker shift that be long overdue we know that erode worker power and pay be bad for productivity and growth more importantly how can any worker in britain trust their government and have faith in their country when for so long the government have fail to deliver for they this government will stand beside work people no matter what lastly the chancellor choose to move britain confidently into the future by be an activist government embrace new era of technological change invest billion in datum storage and processing and transform how we deliver healthcare to shift towards prevention and community health provision hope that she and the secretary of state for health and social care will visit my local trust in wigan which be pioneer such healthcare in the town represent in makerfield for week now conservative members disintereste in big argument about the future have revert to type they have seek to sow discord and division at time tell outright lie and as ever wholly lack the humility to reflect on why they be in opposition and we be in government have speak to hundred of constituent in the last month who have hear some of their nonsense and to they say this promise that this government would not remove free bus pass for pensioner we keep that promise promise that this government would not levy income tax on pension and we keep that promise promise that income tax rate would not go up and we keep that promise we choose to back worker and tax wealth and asset we choose to invest in our nhs we choose to take britain into the future rather than wallow in the past and above all else we choose to keep our promise because that be what labour do wonder whether conservative members will own up to their choice and show some leadership in an age when it be so badly need if they oppose our investment rule which hospital and datum centre would they cut if they oppose our tax rise which struggle public service would they sacrifice if they can not answer those question as they have not do today the public will not take they seriously and will see they for what they be the same old tories always navel gaze and always lack hope and the imagination to see how thing could be well and different and what strong and more confident country might look like their party no long measure up to the age in which we live for one be mighty glad that we have chancellor and government who do today the chancellor have not only make history but have open up britain future once again history maker game changer government do not decide the condition in which budget be make and nobody would choose these condition after year of tory failure but government do get to decide the choice that they make and this government choice be clear they have decide to face the reality head on protect work people payslip and invest in britain and our future that be the responsible path the government reject the short termism of the conservative party which bring chaos to britain the conservatives have not even bother to turn up to this debate on how we will fix the mess that they leave they shirk responsibility for year and be still shirk it today short termism mean that prison reach breaking point as sentence increase but the number of space do not short termism mean handbrake turn on as investor see government who be not serious about their commitment or infrastructure short termism mean that dental decay be the no reason for child admission to hospital and feeble inaction cause crisis in dentistry no wonder the country be leave in such mess the conservatives paper over the crack with bluster and boosterism leave people to fend for themselves where they shirk responsibility we will shoulder it this government know that belief in britain be measure not in false promise and hollow headline but in real meaningful investment our investment will mean more opportunity well pay and public service that be there when people need they britain we can be proud of again the government be make long term decision so that we can look back on decade of expand opportunity and rise standard not another decade of shameful decline which the country and work people can not afford we be elect to clean up mess that be year in the making nobody think that it can be undo in just one budget but what be announce today be the downpayment on change to bring back hope and not false hope announcement of new hospital that never come plan to reduce debt that instead see it spiral and unfunded tax cut that crash the economy be not real hope real hope be build on solid foundation include billion investment for special educational need billion to rebuild crumble school and million to kick start breakfast club allow our teacher to focus on teaching and give our kid the good start in life not only be that good education policy but it be good for the economy and the future of our country can not wait until we open those breakfast club in wirral west to expand opportunity for parent and kid alike the investment of billion in our nhs and million in social care will mean more appointment which will bring down waiting time so that people be not wait year for the help they need that be not just good health policy it be policy that will make britain strong happy and ready to take on the challenge come our way do not want to be face with more story of my constituent wait year for important operation have hear enough of those heartbreaking story to last lifetime stress upon stress cost job and crush hope what the chancellor have announce today be vital choose investment over decline reject fail short termism and fix the foundation while we be at it we be protect the payslip of work people with no increase in vat income tax or national insurance and pay rise that britain desperately need an increase in the living wage to an hour deliver on the promise of secure work and well pay this budget protect work people invest in our nhs and rebuild the foundation for britain future once again we be invest in britain create the condition so that businesse the world over can do the same it be budget of investment and it be budget for investment more of the same simply be not an option hope be on the ballot in july and this budget bring back hope thank my right hon friend the chancellor for her budget statement which bring into sharp focus the choice that the country face the stake could not be high we face choice between begin down path of national renewal with today budget or continue decline and denial if we tread the path of the conservative party we can not fix our problem until we face up to they the conservatives parrot empty fantasy about their legacy but the truth be that they have leave our economy our public service and our finance in ruin the figure be stark accord to the world bank since real income per capita have only grow by that be without historical precedent poverty and hardship have rise and meanwhile britain have fall behind since if we have keep up with comparable country the average household would now be over rich while our economy have languish our public service have be run into the ground nhs waiting list have more than double criminal prosecution and conviction have halve in recent year our school struggle to recruit expert teacher our prison be burst the list go on and on that stagnation be not some kind of accident some kind of economic act of god rather it be the result of decision make by the conservative party under liz truss the conservatives crash the economy send bill and interest rate soar but the truss disaster be but one instalment of their year story of economic mismanagement investment be the downpayment we make today to ensure prosperity tomorrow yet for year the conservatives turn that logic on its head mortgage our future to pay for their political gimmick and undeliverable plan they invest less as proportion of gdp than our peer and hamstrung private investment leave we consistently at the bottom of the league table for business investment that may sound abstract but the effect be all too real over the past decade we have build only half as much motorway as germany and fifth as much rail track as spain our overstretched hospital have only half the average number of ct scanner see in other oecd country and our crumble school have only half the number of electronic whiteboard today britain have barely half the capital per worker of comparable country no wonder we be grow slow no wonder our public service be at break point the conservatives fail the british people and rather than come clean they overspent hide the problem from the public and hide the scale of their irresponsibility even from the government own budget watchdog billion black hole an emergency reserve spend three time over with no money put aside for the infected blood crisis or the post office scandal it be festival of fiscal recklessness for example accord to the ifs the conservatives spend the asylum support budget time over cost every man woman and child in the country their cover up have be lay bare by the review publish by the obr today yet they remain in complete denial they have no shame and importantly they have no plan as the chancellor statement have show though where the conservatives jeopardise our future this government will fix the foundation this budget will deliver stability put our public finance on sound footing unlike the conservative party this chancellor will never gamble with britain future instead she will begin the work of deliver the investment that our economy and public service need launch new investment inject over billion into our crumble school and boost the nhs with record investment she will protect the payslip of work people she will drive forward reform and she will deliver the change the country vote for it will not be easy and change will not happen overnight the conservatives have leave terrible inheritance and as we have hear throughout this debate they have absolutely nothing to say about the answer they would offer will the hon gentleman give way no thank you be wind up as the chancellor have make clear our government will not shy away from take the step need we will not let our ambition be dim to govern be to choose and the conservative party choose to put party before country this government and this chancellor be make different choice to invest and rebuild to fix our nhs to protect people payslip and to deliver change we be put our country first it be choice that will give we our future back and we should all support it in this budget today we be basically ask this question what kind of country will we be think we should first think about this debate because we have desertion on the opposition benches we have use lot of number in this debate and have quickly crunch some more of the conservative parliamentary party be sit face we but high quality think the hon lady should say the same to her leadership contender think it be important to say that because we have very big decision be take in this budget the conservatives be now the opposition and the public have entrust to they the responsibility for hold this government to account for get thing right however there be desertion of duty and dereliction of what they be suppose to do that think the country will remember have campaign in many election and lose many election over the last year know the pain that come from lose but also know the importance of listen to the voter what we hear in the leader of the opposition contribution to the budget debate be refusal to listen to the result of the general election so divorced be the conservatives from the reality of people live that they be project absurd notion again think the conservative party will be judge on that but enough about the conservative party with our first budget in year this labour government be put bournemouth and britain back on track we be fix break public service and broken finance unlike the conservatives we will fix the foundation rather than accept permanent decline unlike the conservatives we be elect to be on the side of work people and we will govern as such unlike the conservatives we be on the side investment to grow our economy and we reject austerity after over decade of stagnant wage and out of control price we be put money into people pocket over people across bournemouth christchurch and poole on the national living wage will see their pay packet increase by and they will get well deserve pay rise of up to year labour be cancel tory stealth tax increase by ensure that income tax bracket will rise with inflation from and we be freeze fuel duty after year of economic mismanagement labour budget will boost our local economy and we be restore economic stability to give business the confidence to invest welcome the fact that the federation of small businesses have say today that the budget be huge help for small firm which have be hear loud and clear after decade of austerity and under investment labour budget will give new lease of life to our struggle public service we be invest record billion in our nhs as somebody who care for two disabled parent when be grow up know that waiting list kill waiting list have get long and more people be die because of that with this labour government there be an investment in protect people life and people quality of life which we should never ever forget we be also provide billion of extra investment in our core school budget and billion to rebuild crumble school in all of our community it be particularly important to that we be invest an additional billion to start to fix the special educational need and disability system it be good start with more to come these be just few of the measure that labour be take to boost the economy nationally and locally and to improve people life labour be make different choice from the conservatives and as somebody who grow up in mouldy and damp council housing care for disabled parent who know the value of labour government be so pleased that people across bournemouth east and across britain will once again know the value of labour government after year of tory chaos and conservative austerity be particularly pleased that those claim carer allowance will see the earning limit increase which mean that people claim the allowance can earn over year while continue to be eligible that be such an important step for carer who give so much to their family their love one and our community commend all that they do in my constituency and across the country this government have get your back we be invest billion in our public service to ensure that child have access to breakfast at school that our road be fix and pothole fill that be all happen because of balanced careful choice by our chancellor of the exchequer to fund the change that people vote for at the general election early today somebody be talk about hope feel hopeful for the first time in very long time and when go knock on door in bournemouth east on saturday and sunday be confident that people will feel hopeful too thank my right hon friend the chancellor for deliver this budget which show the difference that labour government make it show government who be willing to invest in our country and deliver support for those who need it that investment will not be build on tax rise for work people it will be focus on those with the broad shoulder who can afford to contribute more conservative members have criticise capital gain tax increase but less than of people pay capital gain tax they have criticise the increase to employer national insurance payment claim that it would damage small business but we have just hear from my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes that the federation of small businesses have welcome the budget due to the support for small business that we be bring in with that allowance increase the budget will fix the foundation of our economy to focus on what matter most high living standard and well public service those be the thing that make real difference to people life there be currently five conservative members in the chamber and wonder why the other be not here what be it that they do not want to discuss and hear about be it perhaps the government decision finally to set aside funding to compensate the victim of the infected blood scandal and the sub postmaster who be so badly affect by one of the bad miscarriage of justice in our history apology without action as we see from the last government be not enough and victim have have to wait for too long welcome measure such as the industrial strategy with more than billion of funding for research and development in growth industry of the future investment in infrastructure and in broadband which will make real difference to my constituent in north west cambridgeshire the cut to duty on draft alcohol will be welcome boost to local pub in my constituency be delighted to see that after raise with ministers the need to support pub in question yesterday everyone have the right to safe comfortable affordable home and the housing measure in the budget will help make that reality for more people social housing be leave to rot by the last government who end their time in office with nearly million household on waiting list and devastatingly child in temporary accommodation the budget include an immediate injection of million extra capital into the affordable home programme for next year support thousand of new social and affordable home that take overall investment in the housing supply for next year to over billion reform to the right to buy will make the scheme more sustainable support long stand tenant buy their own home but crucially make sure that council can replace those home for which many have be call for so long newly announce housing project across the country will allow for the delivery of more than home this government be deliver the big increase in social and affordable housing in generation be delighted that education be finally get the support it need last year we see school building literally crumble as the extent of the reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete scandal become clear the billion rebuilding programme we have announce will be welcome by school in my constituency and throughout the country it be also hugely positive to see an extra million for breakfast club funding which will make sure that every child start the day feed and ready to learn know how valuable that will be to my constituent one of the big problem over the past few year have be the ever increase cost of living measure such as the increase to the national living wage the extension of the household support fund the preservation of the triple lock on pension and the increase to the carer allowance weekly earning limit will do so much to ease pressure on those that have be feel it for too long the huge boost to childcare will see new and expand nursery across the country ease the pressure on parent include so many in north west cambridgeshire who rely heavily on those service also welcome the million for kinship and foster carer as part of trial it be subject close to my heart and to those of my labour colleague on peterborough city council kinship carer be family or friend who step in to help support child when its parent can not and they do tremendous and critical job that too often go unnoticed be pleased to see the labour government recognise their contribution and the great role that kinship carer can play in our society with the right level of support this budget also demonstrate our concrete commitment to the nhs we be all far too aware of the fragile state of our national health service after year of neglect under the conservatives the inability to see doctor or find dentist come up time and time again when talk to my constituent and know that picture be replicate around the country we be end that with much need resource for equipment and building that will set the foundation for clear the backlog it be labour that create the nhs and it be this labour government who will transform it into service fit for the british people be proud of labour first budget in year it be strong step forward in the journey towards national renewal and it show our labour government drive to deliver for everyone across our country be now impose four minute time limit with immediate effect be proud to speak at the first budget by labour government in year and the first deliver by woman chancellor what well symbol be there of the hollow outrage of the conservatives than their completely empty benches now be disappointed however that the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman be not here because his contribution be thoughtful and learn quite bit from they we have hear how this budget will fix the foundation of this country and as someone who have work in housing all my life know thing or two about what good foundation look like early today ask the prime minister about our plan to end homelessness and he reiterate our strong determination to put an end to homelessness be glad to follow the remark of my hon friend the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling this budget get we close to deliver the million home we need in the next five year to tackle the housing crisis that be so damaging in my constituency it will avoid the failure of the last government by ensure that those home be deliver alongside the infrastructure that community need to thrive we have all hear the story of home build with no public transport no school place and no gp surgery the conservatives deliver only one third of the billion they pledge in the housing infrastructure fund they drain local authority of capacity so developer contribution for local infrastructure have go unspent they fail to provide any stability to social housing leave black hole in housing revenue account in london alone that black hole reach million that be direct consequence of year of tory austerity botched brexit deal and liz truss disastrous mini budget which send interest rate skyrocket the pound plunge and building cost through the roof thank to this budget this government be back to directly deliver public transport water and hospital alongside the million new home we so desperately need this budget choose five year settlement for the social rent sector give register provider the confidence they need to invest in their stock while labour council have be build social housing up and down the country the last tory government pull the rug out from under they by turbocharge right to buy as the number of household in temporary accommodation continue to rise the tories oversee net loss of sorely need council home the reform that our chancellor have announce today will set discount back to reasonable level put sensible time limit on residence and introduce much need protection for new build council home with right to buy receipt go straight back to council where they belong matter close to my heart we will give local authority the security and stability they need to plan for the future and deliver generational boost to social housing this government be elect on mandate to fix the foundation of our economy this budget be the first step to deliver that change and be proud to support it begin by put on record my congratulation to my right hon friend for be the first female chancellor to stand at the dispatch box it be historic moment in the mother of all parliaments after long year of low growth low investment and fail public service we be now turn the page this budget be about fix the fundamental of our economy demonstrate responsible governance by stick to tough fiscal rule and invest for the future those be all necessary to achieve sustainable economic growth in the end economic growth be what will improve people living standard and life chance and it will certainly benefit my constituent in barking crucially this budget ensure that work people in my constituency be protect as we stabilise fix and grow the economy on tax let just say this if opposition member do not want to borrow to invest and do not want to tax business they should tell we what in the budget they would cut they be simply out of touch they moan and groan early but the people in my constituency and the country as whole will not forget that when the conservatives be in power they cause inflation to hit the roof and interest rate rise almost people in my constituency see their mortgage rise by over and rent have soar wage stagnation have cost work people on average as for tax increase it be the conservative government who increase taxis on work people and leave the billion funding gap we on the labour benches will take no lecture from those on the conservative benches who support the chaos of liz truss budget that crash this economy yet they have the audacity to stand up with zero humility after their government leave this country in bad state than they find it politic be full of choice and the conservatives play their politic in this place at the expense of british people in contrast today labour budget will make my constituent in bark well off the pay increase for public sector worker and the increase in the national living wage will put money in the pocket of work people those increase in people be pay decent wage be vehemently oppose by those on the conservative benches with such disdain it be unbelievable we know that the damage of the last government can not be undo with one budget and that the chancellor have to set tight fiscal rule but we will rescue both the economy and public service we must also invest for the future and particularly welcome the chancellor step today to unlock more investment for our public service much of it be capital spend which be really an investment for people additional money for school and local authority this country have to invest or it will decline that be what this labour budget deliver and be deeply proud to support it it be pleasure to speak in this debate on the first labour budget in year it have be long and painful year for my constituent family in my constituency have be struggle to make end meet and our service bear the brunt of government who do not value their work slash their funding and create life destroy waiting list and response time we hear lot from the conservative party today but the one word we do not hear be sorry remain proud to have stand on manifesto that commit to deliver the change work people need and that be what we be do today we owe huge debt of gratitude to the mineworker who power our nation for former coalmine community such as mine in newcastle under lyme the chancellor fulfilment of our manifesto promise on the mineworker pension scheme be so important it give the mineworker the justice they deserve and know that the former miner in newcastle under lyme will be grateful for it in recent year have make it priority to visit local school and since the election have comfort desperate carer and parent and make regular plea to the education secretary the department for education and tory lead staffordshire county council for action on the special educational need and disability crisis in my constituency be very grateful to the chancellor for listen to many of we across the house acknowledge the crisis and commit billion uplift in funding for send provision it be progress there be more to do but that be the difference that labour in government make welcome the minimum wage increase the minimum wage be introduce by the last labour government oppose by the conservatives at the time and the new labour government have increase it for everyone of work age that will help support people with the cost of live legacy leave by the previous government it will help lift child out of poverty and put more money into our local community the people of newcastle under lyme deserve government who take the tough economic decision not duck they and who do not pull funding from our public service or destroy the hope of future generation they deserve government who have their good interest at heart who will invest in our child and their future and who will create wealth and equal opportunity for all this budget be the start of new chapter for my constituent an ambitious economic plan that invest in our people and community and turn the page on the fail conservative policy of the past echo the comment make by my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi about the importance of support our farmer on support with the cost of living crisis we have see an increase in the carer allowance an above inflation rise in the state pension frozen fuel duty an increase in local transport funding and the cutting of draught beer duty we have end the tory fiscal drag and we have scrap the non dom status that some people not too far from this house enjoy deliver on our promise to the country this labour government will always be on the side of work people be proud to back my right hon friend the chancellor in deliver on our pledge not to increase national insurance income tax or vat all those who come to campaign with in the election will recall that our road in north staffordshire be shocking not least thank to the conservative lead staffordshire county council my hon friend the member for warwick and leamington matt western be there very much welcome the million allocate to fix our pothole this be budget that deliver for work people young people local community public service and the good people of newcastle under lyme look forward to work with the chancellor and my colleague on the government benches to deliver the real change that my constituent vote for on july it be an honour to have the opportunity to speak on historic day for this house with the first budget speech ever deliver by woman the first of this labour government and the first in year that be serious about invest in our country our people and our public service there be no escape the inheritance that this government be leave by the conservative party austerity the botched brexit deal and trussonomics in five year our country be present with six different conservative chancellors with no clear or consistent strategy for our economy the question for budget should be how we deliver the right fiscal strategy for the country be afraid that under the conservative party it become question of how to deliver budget in order to get through the next month without another leadership contest that be no way to run an economy or country business confidence be sap the cost of living

on our ability not only to achieve the high position but to deliver as the chancellor have today hope that in future this will be the norm and that my daughter will shrug her shoulder and say woman chancellor so what mum that normal but until that day come let we go on celebrate the exception that smash through glass ceiling after glass ceiling and importantly pass the ladder down that be the labour way as have be demonstrate by this first labour budget in long year this be budget with positive focus on health wage and school but there be also some very tough decision we expect that no one who have be pay attention to the state of the finance leave by the past year of conservative government would have expect anything different the conservatives leave bin fire of waste and self serve greed all pay for with taxpayer money not their money but that of the taxpayer the people we represent billion of pound be waste on warped priority that do not just put tory party before country but

the life of work parent scramble for the precious extra minute of free childcare there be also billion extra for child with special educational need everyone of every political stripe will and should welcome that much need investment every child give the start in life that they need to succeed that be the power of labour government and this be the power of labour budget but should we really be celebrate stop child go hungry should we have have to fight to show that that be the wrong political choice of course not however it be not by accident that people in constituency such as like mine be inflict by so much financial pain from stagnate wage to non existent industrial strategy to local authority cut in luton to the tune of nearly million what difference budget like our show long term strategy for investment and growth and no return to the austerity that cripple community such as mine thank to the rise national minimum wage people in luton north will be well off there be billion

for further education and furth billion for special educational need critical injection of cash and an investment in our future be glad to see that this budget be centre on real priority support work people fix the nhs and rebuild our country we be pay down the overdraft that the conservatives build up still find it the height of irresponsibility that they spend the country emergency reserve three time over on what be essentially electioneer and now they have the brass neck to lecture we about financial responsibility when they turn up that is they do not fund the bus cap or the new hospital programme and they do not disclose their shenanigan to the obr they do not fund our prison and disgracefully they do not fund the compensation scheme for infected blood victim and the sub postmaster they do not even fund day to day spending they leave we with billion in year debt interest payment just to stand still it be short termist and unsustainable be glad to hear that my right hon friend the chancellor will not only cut the deficit but bring we into surplus in just few year time during the election the conservatives make promise that they have no intention of keeping by make promise and fail to fund they they be play politic with people life and service which could only end with the grotesque chaos of prime minister stand in downing street in the rain and call an election that he hop he would not win otherwise people would have ask he to deliver on what he say he be go to do he run around signing cheque know they would bounce for too long work people have bear the weight of fail policy from liz truss rise mortgage rate to billion of pound lose to inefficient project labour plan provide clear choice continue stagnation or real change with labour congratulate the

the university of central lancashire to burnley in order to make we university town and invest in our town centre particularly in the public realm contrast that with year of be ignore since apart from

petitioner remain etc western sahara motion make and question propose that this house do now foxcroft be grateful for this opportunity to raise the issue of the government attitude to western sahara for transparency be as of this morning co chair of the all party parliamentary group on morocco distinction share with the hon member for leeds north east fabian hamilton have also enjoy the kind hospitality of the moroccan ambassador and the moroccan government which have be duly register where appropriate have significant moroccan community in my constituency of which be very proud be former trade envoy to morocco be also an ardent admirer of all thing moroccan and have do everything can in my time here to bring the two kingdom close together the uk outli position on the status of morocco possession of western sahara be the sheet anchor in the uk moroccan relationship that relationship go back to the century history matter particularly in an ancient country such as morocco possession of western sahara long predate colonisation by france and spain and be for moroccans an existential issue any uk government that seek to partner with morocco to make the uk more secure in every sense and to grow the economy just can not afford to allow official inertia to obstruct progress and change fear that it be official intransigence that have mean that the uk now find itself an outlier in international opinion on this matter in the company regret to say of feral state such as russia and iran last month in response to my write parliamentary question on the uk position on western sahara the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs the hon member for lincoln hamish falconer regurgitate the same response that sir humphrey draft for when be do his job successive uk government have regard the status of the western sahara as undetermined if the uk position be inadequate when be minister for north africa and the middle east recent development have make it untenable and incompatible with the uk national interest hope to persuade the minister this evening to push back on the line he be about to read out in the national interest and in the interest of our relationship with our good friend the kingdom of morocco want he to be more successful than be in resist the institutional torpor he will have experience during his first few month in his rather lovely office in king charles street which miss very much indeed first commend the right hon gentleman for all he be do in this debate tonight and for all he have do in the past it be recognise by great many people and we thank he for it do he agree that the reason why the foreign commonwealth and development office guidance advise against travel to area such as western sahara underline the help that the people who live there need do he also agree that rather than simply warn against travel the government should focus on whether any step can be take to help the ten of thousand of people in refugee camp who have no hope at all for the future yes the hon gentleman be absolutely correct of course the uk do that through the united nations and the tindouf camp but he make good point about foreign office advice to people seek to travel to western sahara there be very real potential for western sahara to be vacuum in which the ill dispose can do what they will we can not allow that space to be ungoverned we need to ensure that there be jurisdiction there to bring order and ensure that the ill inclined be not threat to morocco western sahara the wide region and frankly ourselves the anaemic uk official line have rely on two argument for do nothing first that recognise moroccan sovereignty would in some mysterious way challenge our sovereignty over the remain british overseas territory and secondly that support the moroccan autonomy plan would upset algeria which have strained relationship with morocco and support the polisario front call for independence for western sahara there be no evidence that recognise moroccan sovereignty over western sahara would compromise our wide regional equity in any significant way we know this because peer nation that have be much more forward lean on moroccan sovereignty have not suffer backlash from pragmatic algiers the only exception be france but the franco algerian relationship have be toxic before and since independence in so it in no way compare with our own relationship or with that of other country seek positive future with both algiers and rabat appreciate the labour party difficulty in relation to the polisario front under previous management labour support the hard leave polisario front and would never have accept the moroccan autonomy plan but the prime minister have invest much time and political capital in put as much distance as possible between himself and his predecessor he might therefore see this as an opportunity what would change our line to match our peer do to the uk case for hold on to its remain overseas territory the answer lie in the unforced surrender of the chagos island which be decision of infinitely great consequence than what propose would ever be in any event cambridge professor of international law marc weller in his opinion of april be crystal clear there be no point where endorse the position of morocco on which its autonomy proposal be base would in any sense distract from the uk position concern title to the falkland islands what about argentina whose mission to turn the falkland islands into the malvinas have be refuel by the foreign secretary chagos capitulation well it have say the sahara be indubitably moroccan much of south america also appear to support the autonomy plan or have recant its previous support for saharan independence can the right hon gentleman adumbrate how the uninhabited chagos island be equivalent in any way shape or form to the falkland islands most certainly can it be pretty plain to all who take an interest in these matter that the argentine government have their tail up as result of the capitulation on the chagos island if the hon gentleman doubt that the argentine government have have shot in the arm he should look up the argentine foreign minister comment on this subject come back to western sahara could the right hon gentleman explain why the uk government or anybody else should agree to its so call autonomy within the moroccan state give morocco appal human right record in respect of the sahrawi people in western sahara with respect the hon gentleman be make the perfect the enemy of the good morocco stand as beacon of solidity and decency in very troubled the hon gentleman shake his head but be afraid he be incorrect want to see morocco develop alongside its european partner and want it to continue improve its human right record just as want every country around the globe to continue improve its human right record he who be without sin may cast the first stone we need to have western sahara that make sense and that be not vacuum in which the ill dispose can flourish that be the basis of the only credible plan on the table as acknowledge by france the united states germany the netherlands and great swathe of the middle east all those country seem to feel that this be the only way forward we have choice of course we could do nothing and just let this issue rumble on for decade and nothing would happen other than that the people in the tindouf camp would continue to suffer but do not think that be right want something do about it and the moroccan autonomy plan be the only credible plan on the table congratulate the right hon member on secure the debate he must be aware that there be large number of sahrawi people live in refugee camp in algeria and there have be for very long time he must also be aware that since the departure of the spanish from western sahara the sahrawi people have never be give vote on their future and have never be able to decide on decolonisation he will also be aware that legal opinion be against moroccan exploitation of the agricultural mineral and fish resource of western sahara be it not time that we get in line with the african union and other who want to see peaceful approach to the future which mean give the sahrawi people the right to their own self determination to their place in history that surely be what the decolonisation process should be about the right hon gentleman know full well that that would require some sort of referendum or vote the difficulty have always be define what the electorate would be that be why we would be kick the can down the road for decade and decade it be an almost insurmountable issue it seem to france the united states germany the netherlands and other that the only practical solution be to get behind the only credible plan on the table which be the moroccan autonomy plan to put it bluntly worry that the fcdo have be rumble its reluctance to follow our north atlantic peer group in recognise moroccan sovereignty and the autonomy plan have nothing to do with algeria or the british overseas territories it be simply the consequence of institutional torpor and languid left liberal indifference to the advancement of our national interest and it will not do emmanuel macron be in morocco on state visit in letter to his majesty king mohammed early this year he say the present and future of western sahara fall within the framework of moroccan sovereignty he go on france intend to act consistently with this position at both national and international level yesterday president macron address the moroccan parliament repeat the new french position the moroccan press today be report that france will be open consulate and branch of the institut français in laayoune it have even identify the building in which it will be house from next month the franco moroccan chamber of commerce and industry be already establish in western sahara where be we some country primarily african or arab already have consulate in laayoune or dakhla france be our friend but it be also our competition change tack on western sahara have be the necessary precondition in take its relationship with morocco to the next level it be hardly surprising that macron have in his retinue the chief executive officer of french company while the morocco uk association agreement have undoubtedly facilitate bilateral trade we be nowhere near realise its full potential the massive tanger med port in the lee of gibraltar have be largely miss opportunity for the uk our current stance on western sahara now threaten opportunity in dakhla atlantic port our posture mean we can not for example use uk export finance in western sahara and british international investment will not engage if growth for this government be genuinely beyond the rhetorical it can not miss opportunity like dakhla if high minded foreign office official remain sniffy about grubby trade and commerce they might be more willing to reflect on the strategic importance of strong stable ally at the nexus of the atlantic and mediterranean and what tend to happen in ungoverned space particularly where russian and iranian proxy be involve happily the ministry of defence have be forge strong working level relationship with morocco military properly understand the grow influence and leadership the country have be apply across the turbulent region in which it sit the kingdom long stand tradition of tolerance moderate religious teaching and sufi influence make it the foil of extremism and instability in the region and more widely the foreign office might also eventually wake up to the potential for morocco to help the government hit their elusive net zero target and to diversify the grid on offer be km interconnector send the power of the sahara reliable sun and wind to south west england this it would do through the xlinks scheme to match in our time the great british engineering triumph of brunel and telford country genuinely tool itself up for growth need to stop drag its heel on shovel ready scheme such as xlink morocco which be shrug off the colonial yoke be eager to forge new relationship with european country with which it have no baggage that should mean the uk morocco want it to mean the uk but too often we see the dead hand of british officialdom get in the way nobody can fail to be impress by the development that morocco have make possible in western sahara lift the condition of the people who live there nobody can fail to be impress by the regional leadership that rabat have provide in recent year nobody can be in any doubt that this ancient kingdom be welcome bastion of stability security and decency in europe penumbra our voisinage even spain morocco near european neighbour with which it have long stand territorial issue have well line than the uk and more significantly one that have evolve in morocco favour from position of neutrality it be noteworthy that many of our peer have be on journey with language that have typically move from the moroccan autonomy plan be solution to it be the solution or even the only solution this year spain have reiterate the revise position that it adopt in april thus the autonomy plan be the most serious realistic and credible basis for the resolution of the western sahara question in its view germany have adopt similar language then we come to the us the white house issue this proclamation in the united states affirm as state by previous administrations its support for morocco autonomy proposal as the only basis for just and lasting solution to the dispute over the western sahara territory therefore as of today the united states recognise moroccan sovereignty over the entire western sahara territory and reaffirm its support for morocco serious credible and realistic autonomy proposal as the only basis for just and lasting solution to the dispute over the western sahara territory the united states believe that an independent sahrawi state be not realistic option for resolve the conflict and that genuine autonomy under moroccan sovereignty be the only feasible solution we urge the party to engage in discussion without delay use morocco autonomy plan as the only framework to negotiate mutually acceptable solution so what do want want the uk to stop hide under the un skirt and to adopt similar language on western sahara to our permanent un security council friend the us and france if that be too radical for the foreign office we could at least match spain and germany want the uk to match france toe to toe in establish cultural and consular presence in laayoune and dakhla facilitate british engagement with commercial opportunity in western sahara to our mutual benefit want britain to rekindle one of our old diplomatic relationship more than eight century old what well way to advance plan for moroccan state visit to the uk that be the next obvious step after the association agreement that we sign in lancaster house why have it stall above all want the foreign office to wake up to post brexit reality in which we sink or swim depend on our ability to pursue the national interest with pivotally locate like minded jurisdiction with which we can do business country such as morocco or if the minister want he can swallow the line that he be about to rehearse and leave the fruit of new era in bilateral relation to our close continental neighbour be in no doubt that for morocco the uk position on western sahara be the test of how we value our relationship as other have evolve their position over time the uk be out of line and out of date we will make no further progress until we change it be grateful to the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison for secure the debate and for his service in the foreign office and as trade envoy and for his many year of advocate for close relationship between the uk and morocco which be an important goal regret that the drafting of my response to the right hon member parliamentary question be describe as anaemic and regurgitation and will endeavour to provide little more for he in future would however say in relation to foreign office official who get rather extensive mention in the right hon member remark that they be excellent hard work servant of this country who serve without fear or favour they advise minister decide the speech be about to deliver have of course be prepare by the excellent official of king charles street but it be and my ministerial colleague who have decide it so in future would hope that the right hon member might direct his criticism of the policy at rather than my official it be timely moment to have this debate the un security council be set this week to adopt resolution renew the mandate of the peacekeeping mission in western sahara minurso united nations mission for the referendum in western sahara for another month be also grateful for the contribution to this debate from other member many of whom have show long stand commitment to the issue will try to respond to their point as go do not need to tell this chamber of the complexity of the issue the un have maintain through minurso presence in western sahara since successive personal envoy and special representative to the un secretary general have steer both the activity of minurso and un lead process aim at achieve resolution to the dispute territory the uk strongly support minurso activity and we welcome its ongoing de mining and observer operation in western sahara to that end the uk have consistently support un security council resolution concern minurso include most recently resolution in october which extend the mandate for month the uk position remain to support the un lead effort to reach just lasting and mutually acceptable political solution that will provide for the self determination of the people of western sahara this be in line with the position take by successive uk governments and un security council resolution solution agree by all party would contribute significantly to regional security and prosperity and have the potential to unlock wide economic possibility and benefit for those community directly affect by this long stand dispute and of course for the uk as the right hon member allude to it be for the party to agree resolution but the un need our support in its effort to find pragmatic solution this be why we encourage other to support the un lead process and thank successive british ambassador and official who work in the region for their contribution to this effort the uk position be in line with our status as permanent member of the un security council and key contributor to other un peacekeeping mission this position also reflect our core national interest and it be base on our political judgment of how good to protect they the right hon member refer to paper by notable legal scholar but he will understand that it be for ministers of this government to make judgment about how to protect our core national interest and which political judgment lay behind they we believe it be important that we support the principle of self determination which give people the right to decide their own future as enshrine in the un security council resolution on western sahara thank the minister for reaffirm his commitment to self determination and for not go down the road of partition nor indeed of incorporation within the moroccan state as the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison seem to want the minister could go one stage far and follow the eu example which would be the case be we still within the eu and say that the provision of resource and trade with western sahara should only be undertake if it be to the benefit of the indigenous people there rather than to the benefit of the kingdom of morocco we be study the legal judgment to which my hon friend refer closely our position have not be to oppose economic activity in western sahara but that it must benefit the sahrawi people we will continue to engage with our international partner as the house would expect include the european union our fellow security council member regional stakeholder and indeed the un itself in support of its effort in the minister engagement with other european country and other member of the united nations hope that he will have respect for international legal opinion concern the exploitation of mineral agricultural product and fishery from western sahara and the plight of the sahrawi people many of whom have be in refugee camp for almost year and deserve the right to decide their own future in their own country the right hon member be right to refer to the humanitarian situation face the sahrawi refugee think other member refer to the camp in the tindouf wilayah we consistently support both un security council resolution that highlight the sahrawi people face and we contribute through the un to support the refugee camp my official last visit those camp in november be pleased last month to meet staffan de mistura the un secretary general personal envoy for western sahara and our meeting be an opportunity to discuss both his mandate and that of minurso be able to reiterate the uk full support for the un lead process the situation in the tindouf refugee camp to which the right hon member just refer remain challenging and we be work with various un agency and body to provide vital humanitarian support the circumstance have be make more dire by recent heavy flooding in the region as colleague will be aware the situation remain of great concern to the uk and we continue to closely monitor development include through visit by foreign office official member have refer to the moroccan autonomy plan which be first announce in we have choose not to comment publicly on the plan which be not judgment on its merit or otherwise however assure the house that the uk would warmly welcome any solution to the dispute that be able to secure the support of all party while we enjoy constructive dialogue with our partner on wide range of issue include western sahara say to the right hon member for south west wiltshire that their foreign policy decision be ultimately for they to make in their own individual assessment and interest as ours be for we the uk strongly believe that the un be the good way to solve this long stand dispute by deliver solution that be agreeable to all party we will continue to give the un secretary general personal envoy our support encourage constructive engagement with the political process and monitor progress that remain the good way to deliver sustainable just secure and prosperous future for the people of western sahara and the wide region question put and agree to house adjourn
