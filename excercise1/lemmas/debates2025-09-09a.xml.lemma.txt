be pleased to be able to say something in the debate the point make about the history of this really need to be amplify bit more it be disgraceful deal do in by the then labour government that create biot and lead we on the pathway to expel the chagos islander from both diego garcia and the wide archipelago that be do when mauritius be still british colony and the us be put on lot of pressure to get base to fuel the vietnam war that be the context in which the deal be do the treatment of the chagos islander which have be write about extensively by some brilliant writer be unbelievably brutal they be drag out of their home put on boat and send to either seychelles or mauritius with no right no acknowledgment and no real support whatsoever they live for long time in poverty in both those place former members of the house who have sadly pass on do quite lot to try to support they the late tam dalyell former mp for linlithgow go to mauritius to meet len williams the new governor general at the time and ask why people be sleep on the street of port louis he be tell and from that point he take up the cause of the chagos islander because he think they have be disgracefully treat the late robin cook also take the matter up both at the time and much later when he become foreign secretary we should pay tribute to they for what they try to do the reality be that it be the chagos islander themselves who manage to get some decency and recognition olivier bancoult who have become great friend of mine first write to in think it be beautiful handwritten letter say dear mr corbyn could you do anything to help the chagos islander we keep in touch indeed have meet he many time since include recently at the launch of his book the chagos refugees group be found and it operate from olivier bancoult house it make demand on the mauritian government demand on the british government and enormous demand on somebody who later become the british high commissioner to mauritius namely david snoxell he and olivier bancoult do not always get along the latter pressure on david snoxell be enormous he once go to the extent of lock he in his office until they have proper meeting olivier bancoult be feisty guy and the group be feisty people we should recognise that the group determination bring about compensation and litany of court case all over the country and the world have be to many of the hearing have hear argument make in the decolonisation committee and at the un human rights council and at whole series of court process in britain to try to get compensation and recognition of the right of the chagos islander today we be deal with the consequence of the unbelievable heroism of the chagossian people who have be seek recognition and justice regret that there be now difference within the chagossian community tam dalyell and strongly support the move to get right to british nationality for chagos islander and to amend the relevant nationality act that be eventually achieve and that be how be pleased to say they now have unfettere access to this country be also pleased that the treaty continue to include that unfettered access hope that the minister when he come to reply can explain what discussion he have have with all the element of the chagossian community the last thing we want to see be division in community that have suffer so much and deserve so much decency and recognition if the chagos island in their entirety be not pass over to mauritius and mauritian sovereignty there be two consequence first there will be even great dishonesty than we think there be in and secondly britain will be in breach of an icj judgment if that be what people want if that be what conservative and reform members want so be it but they would be act illegally by hang on to the island biot will go and there will be mauritian sovereignty over the whole area support the principle behind the marine protection zone although do not support the no take element that be include at the beginning want chagos islander to be able to return to the archipelago and to undertake sustainable fishing and so on be assure that the mauritian government support and recognise the need to preserve the pristine beauty of the ocean around there be less convinced that the military and the united states force be equally committed to the preservation of the natural world and the environment the record be not good not perfect hope that the minister when he come to reply can assure we that there will be proper inspection not just of the outer island but of the sea and the land of diego garcia it be wrong that the islander be remove it be right that they have an opportunity to return which be what they have always campaign for find it unfortunate beyond belief that they will only be allow to visit diego garcia imagine if we could only visit the home where our parent live or the graf where many of our relative have be bury there be an emotional relationship there that will be break by the refusal of the right of abode in future understand from previous discussion with the minister and other that there could be possibility of the return of right of abode be not sure maybe he can reply to that be happy about there be huge military base on diego garcia no be happy about the rhetoric that have be use in this debate which seem to be crank up the idea of yet another cold war when we should be look for world of peace rather than one of war find that depressing and not really fit for this debate there be right of people who live under colonisation to achieve their independence that be achieve by mauritius but it be thwart in by agree now to return all the island and the archipelago to mauritius we be complete process that should have take place in prior to mauritius independence in have that happen and have there be no separation and creation of biot in we would not be have this debate today because the issue would simply not have arise diane abbott jack abbott debbie abrahams shockat adam zubir ahmed luke akehurst bayo alaba dan aldridge sadik al hassan rushanara ali tahir ali callum anderson fleur anderson tonia
