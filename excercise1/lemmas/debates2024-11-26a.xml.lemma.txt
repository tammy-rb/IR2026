it be pleasure to follow such powerful contribution from member on both side of the house from my hon friend the members for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter for southampton itchen darren paffey for worthe west dr beccy cooper and for mid cheshire andrew cooper and the hon member for north dorset simon hoare for harrow east bob blackman and for bath wera well as the entire ulster unionist party delegation in the form of the hon member for south antrim robin swann support this landmark legislation which be an important step towards deliver on this government manifesto commitment to ensure that the next generation can never legally buy cigarette and to create the first smokefree generation this be an overdue natural step towards tackle the scourge of smoking which claim about life year in the united kingdom smoking be the no preventable cause of death disability and ill health in our united kingdom and it be responsible for one in four cancer death kill up to two third of smoker in wales tobacco cause cancer case every year and smoking be still the lead cause of cancer there however cancer do not respect border so the bill will serve the health interest of our entire united kingdom welcome that and also welcome the welsh government commitment to support this legislation and bring it into force in wales from in fact the welsh government have be well ahead of the curve on this issue as far back as my constituency colleague mark drakeford present legislation that would have ban cigarette use in public space but it fall owe to shameless politicking on the part of plaid cymru whose member note have not be present at all for this important debate rather than agree with the welsh government and introduce what would have be landmark public health legislation plaid cymru member be join by the welsh conservatives and the members of the united kingdom independence party remember of whom describe it as unnecessary government regulation plaid cymru side with the populist right in wales to make political point and the people of wales be bad off because of it undeterred in the welsh government launch their tobacco control action plan which include action to protect child and young people from the danger of vaping such as tight regulation on advertising and on the sale of cigarette that be clear sign that the welsh government take this issue seriously and it be our responsibility here in westminster to support and complement those effort this bill illustrate that this government take seriously their commitment to create the first smokefree generation and to protect child from become hook on vaping let we be clear vaping be not harmless in action on smoking and health estimate that of child age to have try vape although vaping can be an effective way for adult to quit smoking vaping can not be recommend for child as it carry serious risk of addiction and future harm accordingly rather than be deterrent to smoking vaping will see more child not few be expose to nicotine if leave unregulated that be why the measure set out in the bill to implement total ban on vape advertising and sponsorship and subject to consultation on the sale of vape flavour that overtly appeal to child be so important fully support they this bill be legislation that our teacher headteacher medical professional and health service be all call for the vaping industry have be allow to attract kid with different flavour and bright packaging we would not allow that with any other addictive drug and we should not allow it with vaping in addition the bill do not deal with an aspect of vape that would be grateful for the government to consider as the bill continue its passage through parliament currently police officer do not have specific power to confiscate vape from child power that they do have with traditional cigarette pursuant to section of the children and young persons act have speak to south wales police officer and police community support officer know that the power of confiscation be an important tool that they use to deal with antisocial behaviour in designate area of cardiff but their work be neuter if they can not confiscate vape although recognise that if this bill be pass such power will not be necessary in time indeed it will omit section of the children and young persons act from onwards ask the government to consider whether it would be useful to retain the power of confiscation and expand it to include vape for the period between now and so that our police officer have the same legal power across cigarette and vape as tool in their armoury to combat antisocial behaviour aside from that specific point reiterate my support for this important piece of legislation not only will it align this parliament with the progressive action of the welsh government on such important health matter it will bolster our commitment in this place to safeguard public health in so do it will save many thousand of life from the scourge of cancer and protect child from become hook on vaping jack abbott debbie abrahams shockat adam zubir ahmed bayo alaba dan aldridge heidi alexander jim allister
