strengthen the power of the water industry regulator and turn around the performance of fail water company the bill will ban bonus for chief executive when environmental standard have not be meet and will bring forward criminal charge for obstruction our canal be the pride of the black country they be very important to our community our wildlife and our tourism unfortunately like the rest of the waterway we have see serious pollution incident in the canal in recent year what be the government do to protect our canal and waterway and clean up the failure of the last government congratulate my hon friend on be such champion for waterway in and around her constituency toxic pollution of canal or indeed any other waterway be disgraceful and unacceptable the previous government cut resource for the regulator leave they incapable of investigate all the incident that be happen we be put firepower back with the regulator through the water special measures bill which will allow they to claw back the cost of prosecution from the organisation that be prosecute so that they can carry out more enforcement against organisation that get away scot free with pollute our waterway under the previous government dozen of home and business across alverstoke village in my constituency be flood with polluted water from the alver creek when storm pierrick cause tidal surge in april this year we now hear that without urgent flood protection measure that could be one year scenario those measure will cost an extra million and we be wait desperately for news from the secretary of state department about whether we have be award that flood and coastal erosion risk management grant so that the work can start we be now head into winter with high tide and some of my constituent still have not be able to return to their home and business after the previous flooding event what reassurance can the secretary of state give that that announcement be come soon and will he please meet urgently to discuss this scenario congratulate the hon member on win her seat in the general election and take her place will certainly make sure that the relevant minister be able to meet she to discuss that issue in more detail be very pleased that the first meeting of our new flood resilience taskforce will be later today the intention of that organisation be to ensure much well co ordination between whitehall at the centre where the resource be hold and the agency on the frontline that need to be take appropriate action as quickly as possible to protect community business farm and all of the rest of the people who can be affect by flooding particularly give that we be see more frequent severe weather incident because of climate change call the shadow minister sound management of water company be of course vital if customer be to receive the high level of service they expect and environmental performance obligation be to be strictly adhere to some water company be well manage than other so will the secretary of state guarantee that in his effort to hold water company to account no offer of regulatory easement will be provide in other word no permission to lower standard relax environmental permit or reduce agree level of investment will be provide to any water company no matter their financial circumstance by the government or the regulator will be announce later this autumn in just few week time review of the entire water sector include regulation in particular want to make sure that regulation be as tough as possible to ensure that the practice and frankly the abuse that be go on can no long happen part of that will be complete transparency about what be go on on the part of the water company and also have to say on the part of government it be very disappointing that when he be minister the hon gentleman try to cover up the extent of sewage spill before the election tell environment agency official not to put the key figure on the front page of its environmental portal order say that the hon member try to cover up be suggest that member be lie and do not on point of order mr speaker the right hon member can not raise point of order now he have be here long enough to know that they come at the end of question interruption order be deal with this we really have to reflect on what we say about other member in this house and would like the secretary of state to withdraw what he have suggest withdraw that comment perhaps should have say that the shadow minister could have be more open and transparent interruption order be not go to open up that question we will now have the second question from robbie moore thank you mr speaker so there we have it the secretary of state first outing at the dispatch box and he be not able to clearly answer the question ask will the secretary of state confirm that in fulfil his obligation to hold water company to account he will not issue regulatory easement no matter their financial circumstance will he answer that question clearly right now from the dispatch box as have already say we be look to strengthen not weaken the regulation the regulation be inappropriate it be not just the regulation itself but the lack of resource the regulator have have that be why the water special measures bill we be introduce will allow the regulator to claw back resource from water company that be successfully prosecute so that they have the firepower to prosecute further wrongdoing by those water company or other responsible for it funding for farming if he will maintain the level of funding for farming what discussion he have have with the chancellor of the exchequer on fund for farming if he will maintain the level of funding for farming the government will restore stability and confidence in the sector by introduce new deal for farmer to boost rural economic growth and strengthen food security alongside nature recovery the government be currently conduct spending review which will conclude in october departmental budget include spending on farming will be confirm through this process the labour party manifesto rightly state that the labour party recognise that food security be national security agree but those word must be match with action we have already ask today about future budget but have not hear any answer will the secretary of state confirm that there will be no real term cut to the agriculture budget as the hon member will know there be spending review process go on which will culminate with announcement in the budget that be the point at which all of that will be make clear and apparent would gently remind the hon member that it be her government who underspent the farming budget by million in the previous financial year that money should have be in the pocket of farmer who desperately need it for the work they be do to provide the food we want to eat and to help nature recovery yet that government be too incompetent to get it out the door this government will make sure that the money allocate to farmer be hand over to farmer so that they be able to use it for the purpose for which it be intend be an mp for the scottish borders be lucky enough to represent some of the good farmer and food producer in the whole of the uk however as we have hear the new government have choose not to give they any clarity about their future funding settlement so ask again can the secretary of state commit not to cut the funding for farmer and food production congratulate the hon gentleman on his appointment as shadow secretary of state for scotland as say previously spending review process be go on no government announce their budget in advance of the budget take place can not do that either but assure the hon gentleman that we be keen to ensure that farmer in every single part of the united kingdom receive the support they need to do the job that we as country need they to do to ensure that we have the food security that we want because it be part of our national security and that this country deserve farmer in my constituency who receive funding through the sustainable farming incentive be concerned that some of the scheme be become over subscribed and therefore their income be reduce will the secretary of state give reassurance that that particular initiative will continue and will do so at the exist funding level have be clear throughout the election campaign and since that we do not intend to overturn the applecart in respect of the old scheme in general include the sfi we support the principle behind the scheme and want to see they continue in term of what the hon gentleman allude to there be way to make they work well my intention be to work closely with the farming sector and the nature sector to make sure that we get the maximum bang for our buck for every single penny that go through those scheme and that the farmer who need it get the support they deserve british farmer have be badly let down by crippling trade deal skyrocket energy price and devastating flood will the secretary of state outline how he will restore confidence and support british farmer my hon friend be absolutely right there be all sort of way in which farmer have feel very let down over the past year and that have contribute to the tragic situation today in which we have the low level of confidence ever record in the farming sector our new deal for farming be intend to start to sort part of that out my hon friend refer to trade deal that undermine farmer they be furious about that and at the national farmers union back british farming day reception yesterday farmer make that clear to again we have rule out any future trade deal that undercut and undermine british farmer in the way the previous government australia and new zealand trade deal do may support your thank to terry wiggins mr speaker he have be great servant of this house and be lovely bloke the conservative complaint about support for farmer be bit lame have the secretary of state have the opportunity yet to work out why there be an underspend of over million in the agricultural budget last year my hon friend raise an important point opposition member be ask today about budget decision that they know can not be announce before the budget when presumably they be aware because the statement have be lay that they underspent the previous budget to the tune of million it be not that they be not warn about this either because while we be in opposition we be make point as be farmer about underspend and the desperate need to get that money back out to the farmer who need access to it we will review the situation find out exactly what go wrong and publish that information as soon as it be available call the liberal democrat spokesperson somerset be home to farmer and food producer which be more than any other county in the uk they be worried that the million of support will be strip from they because the previous government replace the basic payment scheme with system that be too complicated for many farmer to access notwithstanding the previous comment will the secretary of state confirm that he will not be slash their funding and give farmer the confidence that they need to be able to invest in the future and secure the nation food security be delighted to congratulate those farmer producer and grower in somerset it be fine county and they do an incredibly good job of which the hon lady be rightly proud hope she will understand that can not make comment about the budget in advance would be in deep trouble with the chancellor of the exchequer which be something wish to avoid at the appropriate time we will make absolutely clear what we intend to do my intention be to fight the corner of farmer through the spending review process so that we can make sure they receive the resource they deserve support for farmers what step he be take to support farmer this labour government will introduce new deal for farmer to boost rural economic growth and strengthen food security alongside nature recovery we will make the supply chain work more fairly well protect farmer from flood and back british produce we be continue the roll out of the sustainable farming initiative and will optimise scheme and grant to ensure that they work for farmer it be the time of year when we thank farmer and nature for the harvest and it have be particularly difficult year farmer be plan ahead for next year so will the minister kindly give one word answer to my question understand that she can not announce what be in the spending review but in the request that her department have make to the chancellor be the amount she have ask for more or less than billion thank the hon lady dare say my hon friend for her question yes it be good to remind ourselves that this be the time of harvest when we should all be grateful and give thank in answer to her question as previous chair of the treasury committee she know that we can not make comment on the budget before it come through like the secretary of state do not wish to be in trouble with the chancellor either

in scotland and its significant contribution to the wide uk economy will the secretary of state share what he will do to ensure that food security and food production in scotland remain at the heart of our national security many of those issue be devolve to the scottish government have already hold meeting with the scottish agriculture minister and we be due to meet again next week and will be make sure that we have strong work relationship where the uk government have role in particular be with trade deal many british producer be upset that because the previous government erect barrier to trade when they be tell that they would continue to get open access to the european market they could no long continue to sell their great british produce into those market damage they economically and financially we will be seek new veterinary deal with the european union to get those export move again remind those on the front bench that it be topical question so question and answer have to be short and punchy the thing be have to try to get in as many as can let we see good example of that with the shadow secretary of state the secretary of state have repeatedly talk tough with the water company yet the water special measures bill that he announce actually weaken number of measure such as the automatic fine for category and prosecution and remove the unlimited penalty that would apply he say that the review of water regulation would strengthen requirement on water firm will he therefore confirm to the house that there will be no regulatory easement as part of that review the very bill that the right hon gentleman refer to strengthen regulation we will be look far at regulation through the review the intention will be to make it strong not weak because it be far too weak under the previous government and we need to turn that around raw sewage be discharge into our river and sea for shocking million hour last year will the minister reassure our coastal community include my own in worthing west that water company will be hold accountable for the necessary investment to address the systemic and chronic pollution of our water congratulation to my hon friend on her election

of the decade many of my constituent be already struggle with the cost of living what step will the secretary of state take to stop private water company rip off consumer in the west midland and to keep bill at an affordable level of course we recognise the impact of the cost of live on all our constituent but the year of under investment by the conservatives mean that we need billion worth of investment in the industry customer bill will be ringfence under the change bring about by the government and if that money be not spend on infrastructure improvement it will be refund to customer of course the final bill be determine by ofwat not the government my constituent in hastings and rye get their water bill this month many of they be shock to see their bill go up despite the failure of southern water which include sewage dump along our coastline flood in our town centre and leave we without water it have even charge we for the five day when the tap run dry what be the government do to clean up the mess leave by southern water and by the conservative party what have be go on in my hon friend constituency be completely unacceptable know that she have be huge champion for clean up

bring our child and our picnic to the beach we should consume the food and leave only footprint in the sand be convene circular economy taskforce and we will look at seasonal need as part of that any cut to the environmental land management scheme would be blow to farmer and to the government climate and nature recovery mission the nature friendly farming budget need to be not just maintain but increase do the secretary of state agree with the economic assessment make by the royal society for the protection of birds the national trust and the wildlife trusts that the environmental land management budget will need to be increase to around billion year to meet the target the government remain fully committed to the elm scheme and my right hon friend the chancellor will make

measure of that kind that will address the problem highlight by my hon friend the police efficiency effectiveness and legitimacy report on thames valley police establish that the force do not make full use of clare law do the solicitor general agree that clare law be powerful tool to protect woman from those who have already be prosecute for domestic violence thank my hon friend for raise an important issue he be right clare law be powerful tool and it need to be apply more evenly and consistently the domestic violence disclosure scheme know as clare law enable the police to disclose information to victim or potential victim of domestic abuse about previous abusive or violent offending by partner or ex partner the police need to consider each request on its own merit however more need to be do to ensure that the scheme be use consistently by police force across the country and understand that the home office be currently engage with the police to see how its application can be improve may warmly welcome the solicitor general to her place be sure she agree that the dreadful legacy of the last government record on rape conviction can not be allow to continue she know that

problem that need to be look at that be why in appropriate case we be look at use associate prosecutor to clear the backlog in our court more generally but for the most serious crime of rape and

role and hope that it go accord to plan can she far clarify that funding be available for each branch of the prosecution service to provide the protection and support that help victim to speak out be there any discussion about whether increase funding for victim support could embolden victim and help to facilitate even more safe prosecution it be vital that we place victim at the centre of our

on lord darzi investigation into the nhs unlike the last holder of this office this government will be honest about the problem the nhs face and serious about fix they that be why ask lord darzi an eminent cancer surgeon who serve both labour and conservative lead government with distinction to conduct an independent investigation into the state of our national health service be sure the whole house will want to join in thank he for produce this expert comprehensive report copy of which have place in the libraries of both houses tell lord darzi that we want hard truth wart and all his finding be raw honest and breathtaking he say although have work in the nhs for more than year have be shock by what have find he have uncover an enormous charge sheet too long to list in this statement so these be just few the nhs have not be able to meet its promise to treat patient on time for almost decade patient have never be more dissatisfied with the service they receive waiting list for mental health and community service have surge year of progress on cardiovascular disease be go into reverse and cancer be more likely to be death sentence for nhs patient than for patient in other country it be not just the sickness in the nhs that concern lord darzi but sickness in society child be sicker today than decade ago and adult be fall into ill health early in life that be pile pressure on to the nhs and hold back our economy those be some of the symptom the report be equally damn on the cause first decade of under investment leave the nhs year behind the private sector on technology with few diagnostic scanner per patient than almost every comparable country include belgium italy and greece and in mental health patient be treat in victorian building with cockroach and mouse infestation where man be force to share two shower secondly there be the disastrous top down reorganisation oversee by lord lansley lord darzi assessment be damn calamity without international precedent it take scorch earth approach to health reform by minister be put in place workaround and stick plaster to bypass the legislation rather than liberate the nhs as promise the health and social care act imprison more than million nhs staff in broken system for the good part of decade the effect be still feel to this day just imagine if all the time effort and billion of pound waste on dissolve and reconstitute management structure have instead be invest in service for patient clearly the nhs would not be in the mess it find itself in today thirdly there be coronavirus everyone can see the last damage cause by the pandemic but until now we do not know that the pandemic hit the nhs hard than any other comparable healthcare system in the world the nhs cancel far more operation and routine care than anywhere else as lord darzi write the pandemic impact be magnify because the nhs have be seriously weaken in the decade precede its onset in other word it be not just that the conservatives do not fix the roof while the sun be shin they douse the house in petrol and leave the gas on and covid just light the match that be why waiting list have balloon to million today interruption if be an opposition member would not complain about the diagnosis would take responsibility fourthly this sit firmly at opposition members door so they should sit and listen there be the failure to reform from onwards the previous government oversee increase in the number of staff work in hospital do it lead to well outcome for patient no at great expense to the taxpayer the nhs have instead see huge fall in productivity we pay more but get less deplorable waste of resource when so many part of our health and care service be cry out for investment as lord darzi have put it british airways would train more pilot without buy more plane doctor and nurse be waste their time try to find bed for their patient and deal with outdated it when they ought to be treat patient too many people end up in hospital because they can not get the help that they need from pharmacy gp or social care the effective reform of the last labour government which drive well performance and well care for patient have mostly be undo and that be why patient can not get gp appointment an operation or even an ambulance when they need one today that be what the conservatives do to take the nhs from the short waiting time and high patient satisfaction in history to the broken nhs that we see today lord darzi have give his diagnosis now it be over to we to write the prescription and we have three choice the first be to continue the conservatives neglect and allow the nhs to collapse that be the path on which they set the nhs and the path that it be on today or we could as some of my critic on the left demand pour ever increase amount of money in without reform waste money that be not there and that work people can not afford to pay that would be wasteful and irresponsible so we will not take that path this government be make different choice we choose recovery and reform we be take action today to deal with the immediate crisis by hire gps whom the conservatives have leave without job while patient be go without an appointment and agree an offer to end the strike that they allow to cripple our health service at the same time we will introduce the fundamental reform need to secure the future of our nhs early today my right hon friend the prime minister confirm that the government would publish year plan for change and modernisation on the foundation of lord darzi report our plan will deliver the three big shift need to make our nhs fit for the future the first be from analogue to digital give patient proper choice and control over their own healthcare and finally realise the untapped potential of the nhs app there will be fully digital patient record so that your surgeon can see the note that your gp write by marry our country lead scientific mind with the care of more than million nhs staff we will put nhs patient at the front of the queue for cut edge medicine and treatment that we can only imagine today secondly there be the shift from hospital to community turn our nhs into neighbourhood as much as national health service so that patient can get their test and scan on their high street and be care for from the comfort of their own home that mean bring back the family doctor and build national care service that can be there for we when we need it able to meet the challenge of this century thirdly there be the shift from sickness to prevention which mean take the decision that the conservatives duck to give our child healthy happy start in life it mean stop the targeting of junk food ad at child ban energy drink for reform the nhs to catch illness early start by offer health check in workplace and on smartphone and deliver the tobacco and vapes bill that the conservatives fail to pass to tackle one of society big killer lord darzi diagnosis be that the nhs be in critical we perform major surgery the patient will die but he also find that its vital sign be strong an extraordinary depth of clinical talent and share determination to improve care for patient this be public service free at the point of use so that whenever we fall ill we never have to worry about the bill the nhs be break but it be not beat every person have meet in the nhs during my first two month as health and social care secretary be up for the challenge it will take time but this party the party that create the nhs have turn the nhs around before and we will do it again commend this statement to the house on point of order mr speaker how long have the hon member be here point of order come at the end you can not intervene in the middle of these proceeding call the shadow secretary of state thank you mr speaker thank the secretary of state for advance notice of his statement the nhs belong to we all and we all care about it so let we stop the political posturing and talk constructively about its future we all know that our healthcare system face significant pressure as do all health system around the world we be live long and with multiple and complex condition we have wide societal pressure such as the impact of social medium on the development of some young mind as well as the cost pressure of miracle drug develop by our world class life science sector for their treatment benefit and the shock of the pandemic have have catastrophic impact on the nhs and its productivity believe there be much to be proud of in the nhs its dedicated staff look after million people day more people than in it have more doctor more nurse and more investment that at any point in its history it be deliver ten of million more out patient appointment diagnostic test and procedure for patient than in and we deliver the fast roll out of vaccination for covid in the world free our society more quickly than other country we have more healthcare in the community with the opening of community diagnostic centre the large central cash investment in mri and ct scan capacity in the history of the nhs and new surgical hub and the launch of pharmacy first help to free up million gp appointment for those live with more complex condition interruption say to the secretary of state that pay he the courtesy of listen to he in silence so hope he will do the same for do say anything the right hon gentleman be chuntere from sedentary position we on order want to hear the right hon lady and member constituent want to know what be be say please let we give the same courtesy that expect for the secretary of state thank you mr speaker we on the conservative benches never pretend that everything be fix we have not pretend that we have monopoly on wisdom or that there be easy answer to the difficult challenge we face for the nhs to thrive in its next year it need to reform modernise and improve productivity that be why the conservative government work with nhs england announce the nhs productivity plan at the spring budget to transform how the nhs work through well it system for frontline staff the expansion of service on the nhs app which be use by three out of four adult in england and the use of new technology include voice activate artificial intelligence together that would see productivity grow by year by the end of the decade and unlock billion worth of saving yet the plan be not mention in the page report why be such an important and forward look reform miss from the report and can the right hon gentleman confirm that he be choose to cancel it yes or no new medicine and trial be an essential part of the productivity challenge there be only one mention of the national institute for health and care excellence in the page report do the government have strategy for life science and the provision of rare medicine include cancer and dementia drug why have they pause the childhood cancer taskforce the need for reform be also why we implement the first ever long term workforce plan with nhs england to train even more doctor nurse midwife and other healthcare staff for the future the plan be describe by the nhs ceo amanda pritchard as one of the most seminal moment in our year history yet it be not mention in today report again why be such an important and forward look reform miss from the report be the right hon gentleman go to cancel the new place and form of training include apprenticeship that be to be provide through that plan the need to modernise be why in we announce the large programme of hospital building in modern history new hospital across england by interruption would be careful if be some back bench mps today seven new hospital have open the midland metropolitan university hospital will open at the end of the year imagine the secretary of state will enjoy go to its launch and further be in construction we be not even halfway through the decade since january it have be labour plan to pause review delay and presumably possibly cancel those new hospital that be when it publish its health mission it be on page for those who have not read it in other word it be always labour plan to delay and possibly cancel the new hospital and it have nothing to do with the chancellor questionable accounting since the general election when that be point out in the general election campaign labour candidate run around promise voter that their new hospital or community diagnostic centre be safe with they in torbay chelsea and fulham basingstoke watford bracknell truro corby and kettering to name few will the right hon gentleman confirm that labour will delay those hospital order it be difficult but the time limit be suppose to be five minute and it have now be six minute second so we be well over can you now conclude on that sentence thank you mr speaker there be one part of great britain where on almost every measure the nhs perform the bad labour run wales the right hon gentleman have compare order be sorry mean that you be to conclude now not to continue with the rest of the speech call the secretary of state the first word that the shadow secretary of state for health and social care should have say be sorry she say that she never pretend everything be fix and that be true but it be about time that she admit that it be her party that break the nhs in the first place in fact it have be feature of debate in the house since the general election that the opposition have take absolutely no responsibility for the mess they leave our country in include billion black hole and the new hospital programme that the right hon lady refer to in which the timetable be work of fiction and the money run out in march she know that when she go to the country to claim that the programme be fully fund she talk about the decision make by nice that be new labour reform and modernisation one that thankfully survive the last year the right hon lady have endorse the right hon member for newark robert jenrick in the conservative party leadership election wonder what she make of his admission that the conservatives fail to make the tough reform that the nhs need because they be afraid of what labour might say be that not the most derisory excuse for year of neglect my predecessor do not bear responsibility for everything in the darzi report this crisis be more than decade in the making but wonder when the right hon lady will show some humility on behalf of her party and apologise for the mess that her government make of our national health service otherwise why should anyone trust what the conservatives have to say ever again this government be give mandate for change and nowhere be that more need than in our nhs the report must mark the beginning of the long hard work of change it be the platform from which we will launch decade of reform that will make sure that the nhs can be there for we when we need it for we our child and our grandchild it must draw line in the sand so that we never go back to the pain fear and misery that the conservative party inflict on million of patient rise this statement will run for an hour so please help each other let we try clive efford as good example thank you mr speaker will rise to the challenge welcome the secretary of state statement in the previous labour government commission report from sir michael marmot on the state of society and health and he find that there be health inequality particularly in deprive area ten year on his second report find that health inequality have become even bad against the backdrop of an underfunded nhs do that not demonstrate the urgency of the need to invest in those community under this government what can my right hon friend do to direct resource into the most deprived community in order to turn around those health inequality my hon friend be absolutely right that our country have stark health inequality it be not right that people who live in different part of the country have such different chance of live well girl bear in blackpool can expect to live healthily until she be whereas girl bear in winchester can expect to live healthily until she be that be why with the prime minister mission drive approach we will not just get our nhs back on its foot and make sure it be fit for the future we will also reduce the cost and burden of demand on our national health service by attack the social determinant of ill health call the liberal democrat spokesperson much of the content of lord darzi report have be know for some year none the less today report be scathing summary of the complete devastation that the conservatives have work on our health service and on the health of our community we liberal democrats have long argue that we need to shift healthcare from hospital to high street and from treatment to prevention because do so improve health outcome and save taxpayer money it be win win but the report be long on diagnosis and short on prescription so may invite ministers to read our fully cost manifesto to fix public health and primary care by recruit gps end dental desert boost public health grant by billion implement our five year plan to boost cancer survival rate and put mental health expert in every school do the secretary of state accept that there be an elephant in the room social care will he meet to discuss the liberal democrat plan for social care start with free personal care this bold idea would prevent many people from go into hospital in the first place as well as enable they to be discharge from hospital fast do he accept that it be truth universally acknowledge that we can not fix the nhs if we do not fix social care too as for the dire state of our hospital and primary care estate well the conservatives have leave it to fester like wound will the secretary of state give the green light to hospital that be ready to rebuild such as mine in west hertfordshire will ministers look to reform outdated treasury rule that be prevent our integrate care board and hospital trust from spend and invest their fund in the gp practice and hospital that we need this government say that they want growth well health and wealth be two side of the same coin which be something the conservatives do not understand if labour want economic growth fix our health and social care must be its top priority and it must be priority without delay how refreshing to have constructive opposition in the chamber it be clear throughout the election campaign that my party and the liberal democrats have much in common both in the commitment we make which in some case be identical and in our share area of emphasis the link between health and wealth the importance of prevention and the importance of social care as the prime minister reiterate again this morning we be absolutely determined to address both the short term crisis and the long term need of the century in our social care system we want to work on cross party basis wherever possible so would be delighted to meet the liberal democrat spokesperson hundred of thousand of operation include dozen of my own list be cancel because of the strike in the nhs over the past two year do the secretary of state agree that the conservatives refusal to negotiate with the doctor contribute to the terrible state of the health service and that end the strike be the first step towards fix the nhs it stick in the craw to hear the carping and criticism from the conservatives and their obvious bitter resentment that we be able to do in three week what they fail to do in over year all the while they complain about the cost of solve the strike they say nothing about the cost they rack up the direct financial cost of cover the strike as well as the untold cost of misery to patient whose operation procedure and appointment be cancel even as the shadow secretary of state for health and social care and her ministers have not even bother to meet the junior doctor since march this year the conservatives have no ground to complain thank those who daily work in nhs service across our country if the secretary of state be truly serious about assist and support the whole of our nhs in england across all our constituency wart and all as he say will he explain thoroughly why the health outcome and experience of family across wales over the last year do not merit this attention equally be it perhaps because wales be labour run have never deny nor have the welsh government that our health and social care system be in crisis across the united kingdom and that wait time and patient outcome be not where they should be interruption the conservatives do not wish to acknowledge the truth and even now without shred of humility or acceptance of the responsibility of their record in government they carp from the sideline they will not admit or accept that different part of the united kingdom have different strength and weakness regardless of the fact that there be scottish national party government in scotland or unique arrangement in northern ireland as well my friend in the welsh government be proud that in my first weekend as secretary of state for health and social care make it my business to phone my counterpart in scotland wales and northern ireland make it clear that we will always work constructively whatever our party and however hard we will fight each other at the ballot box rather than point finger at other part of the united kingdom as the conservatives do when they be in government this government be determined just as the last labour government be to create rise tide that lift all ship look forward to work with every devolve administration to improve health and care outcome across the whole of our united kingdom the secretary of state be right that the future of our nhs lie in reform and not wait until people get sick before we intervene to keep they well but we can not do that without money he say we can not waste money that be not there but we be waste money that be there on the contract we have with the private sector he know feel strongly about this issue million of pound be be pay to private equity back fund to run sexual health centre in the nhs the icare clinic billion of pound be be lose to the legal loan shark of our nhs the private finance initiative company and some trust be spend more on pfi payment than on drug as part of the process will he commit to an urgent review of the way in which the nhs have work with the private sector because reform must also include restructure our debt my hon friend have do lot of work in this area and would be delighted to meet she let give the conservative party lesson in humility however proud be of the last labour government and be incredibly proud of what they do to our health estate the investment they bring in through range of different type of private financing and the impact that have can see the benefit in my own constituency have never shy away from what we do not get right at the same time as celebrate what we get right in government we must reflect on what we do not get right and genuinely learn those lesson which be what we do in opposition it take we too long to get back into government we will learn from that for the future but it have be really interesting to listen to conservative members over the past nine week they have not learn anything they have not get the message and they be not go to change as labour embark on reform programme may ask whether the secretary of state have read the report of the mid staffordshire public inquiry which look at the shocking patient neglect last time labour be in charge read it might temper the hubris that he be show in the chamber today in the face of the challenge that his colleague in wales have certainly not manage to overcome gently point the hon gentleman to the bold claim make by the now shadow chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt about patient safety he might like to reflect on every subsequent patient safety scandal in fact he might want to walk into maternity service across the country and ask himself whether the conservatives bother to learn lesson on patient safety pharmaceutical producer auden mckenzie and actavis uk charge excessive and unfair price for hydrocortisone tablet nhs spending on those product rocket because producer game the system how will my right hon friend ensure that future procurement process deter the rigging of drug price my hon friend make great point and he have give great service to the public accounts committee of this house by drill into waste inefficiency and exploitation of the public purse want to work with the great life science sector and pharmaceutical industry in this country and globally but in spirit of genuine partnership really good work relationship require social responsibility it certainly involve not rip off the taxpayer welcome the report the previous government leave this government with nhs and care service in the bad crisis in their history the secretary of state lead by emphasise the decade of underinvestment that need to be couple with point out the very weak workforce planning when he meet the liberal democrats will he review our cost plan to raise the investment necessary to address the issue highlight in the report and to strengthen workforce planning in order to deliver service fiscal policy be matter for the chancellor know on which side my bread be butter so will not write her budget or spending review now but let reassure the hon gentleman that notwithstanding the billion black hole that the conservatives leave in the public finance this year and the weak foundation of our economy that we have inherit the chancellor know as well as do that it be investment and reform that will deliver result it will take time we can not reverse more than decade of underinvestment in single budget or even single spending review but at least we have government able to face up to the hard choice and capable of make they very much welcome lord darzi report which expose how our country be let down by the previous government in my bassetlaw constituency will be ask when people who need gp appointment will get one and when the person dental waiting list will come to an end be listen to my gps and my dentist so that can work with they to tackle this crisis will be meet they shortly what be the secretary of state message to they all my hon friend who be delighted to see represent bassetlaw be already show herself to be an outstanding champion for her community she raise really good challenge that we all face as constituency mp the public recognise that change take time and that we can not fix more than decade of problem in the immediate future but they want to know that at least we be hit the ground run and get the job do can reassure my hon friend constituent in bassetlaw that within our first couple of month this government employ more gps on the frontline who have be leave unemployed by the previous conservative government we do that pretty much immediately we have settle hope we await the outcome of the ballot the junior doctor dispute so we can remove the cost of disruption and industrial action and start work on get the waiting list down we will be work at pace to deliver more appointment every week so that we can cut waiting list and urgent emergency dentistry appointment so that we can ensure that people get the care they need every single promise in our manifesto notwithstanding the challenge in the public finance be fully cost fully fund promise that we will keep and that the country can afford may urge the secretary of state to learn from what be work well in the nhs as well as from what have go wrong in reference to the health and care act paragraph on page of the report state the result be that the basic structure of headquarters region and integrate care board icb be fit for purpose draw the secretary of state attention to the suffolk and north east essex icb which be one of the most successful in the country can we learn from that success and build it into other area thank the hon gentleman for his constructive approach the tragedy of the health and care act be that large part of its focus be on try to correct the enormous damage do by lord lansley through top down reorganisation that nobody want and that the country could not afford that be why have say very clearly that we will not repeat the mistake of top down reorganisation with the architecture of the system we will take an approach of evolution rather than counter revolution on the hon gentleman point about learn from what be work well in the nhs what give great hope for the future of our national health service be that every day there be amazing people provide great quality care reform innovate and show we what the future look like it be the responsibility of this government to take the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs that be exactly what we will do lord darzi report make grim reading and lay bare the failure of the last government nhs staff up and down the country will recognise everything in it do the secretary of state agree that much more need to be do on retain recruit and compensate the nhs workforce and make sure that we have workforce fit for the future for all the innovation that modern technology will bring the revolution in big datum ai machine learning and medical advance that we will see very soon but can scarcely imagine today health and social care will always be fundamentally people base service if you do not value your people you lose they and end up in the appalling situation that we be in today we have invest so much money and time in train people who imagine long future for themselves in the nhs but who because of the reality to which they be subject by the previous government be now pack up and move into different career or to other continent we be determined not just to recruit the great staff we need but to value and retain the brilliant staff we already have the secretary of state will know that cancer be the big cause of death by illness for child under in the uk and that this be childhood cancer awareness month he will not know that it be also the third anniversary of the death of my constituent sophie fairall who be year old with sophie mum charlotte have be campaign for the past three year for the child and young people cancer taskforce to be set up the taskforce be set up at the beginning of this year with the stated aim of meaningfully change detection treatment and care for child with cancer have listen carefully to the secretary of state and have hear he passionately set out that he want to focus on prevention and early intervention yet this month we learn that he be pause the taskforce parent of child with cancer be deeply disturb by that announcement as be can the secretary of state set out why it be make absolutely thank the hon member for the way she put her question send my deep condolence to sophie family on what will inevitably be difficult day suspect just the late of many difficult day on the imaginable pain grief and loss that they have suffer thank the hon member for her work over many year campaign on child cancer in this house on behalf of her constituent and so many other family affect by young cancer the pause be because we be look at the breadth of the work of the department to make sure that we have the right vehicle to deliver the outcome that we want that be why we have pause rather than cancel slam or criticise the work that she be do would be delighted to meet she to talk about the genesis of the taskforce and how we can take forward the outcome that she want to see what we be try to avoid be plethora of taskforce and the risk that there have sometimes be this be not party political point because this span successive government of taskforce be an alternative for action know that she want action so let we meet and see what we can do together when grow up in stretton under the last labour government could get an appointment with my family doctor the next day after year of the conservatives stretton resident now often have to travel more than six mile to gp surgery in another village just to get an appointment for which they have already wait week do the secretary of state share my view that this be unacceptable and that it fall to this government to fix the conservatives mess my hon friend be absolutely right we need to make sure that we have the right staff in the right place and an equitable distribution of access to nhs service right across the country we also want to shift from the hospital centre nhs that we see today to neighbourhood centre service that be why we have act immediately to put more gps on the frontline before the end of this year be look forward to work with gps to expand access to primary care right across the country especially in community that be particularly under serve this review highlight the need for capital investment in the nhs the question that nhs staff and patient in north west norfolk have be urgent be the government commit to replace their hospital which be affect by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete with new queen elizabeth hospital in king lynn by yes or no can absolutely reassure the hon member that raac impact hospital be priority we be put safety first and it be just shame that when his resident have prime minister in their backyard the conservative government do not fix the problem for the sake of openness and transparency will just mention that be former chair of an nhs trust and public health academic recognise the real issue that be raise in the finding of the darzi rapid review be grateful to lord darzi for refer in particular to the inequality that we have experience and how those inequality be lay bare during covid will the health and social care secretary expand on the cross departmental work that he be do agree with my hon friend the members for walthamstow ms creasy and for eltham and chislehurst clive efford that people socioeconomic circumstance drive their health status we do not want situation where for every increase in child poverty six additional baby per live birth do not reach their first birthday thank my hon friend for her question and congratulate she warmly on her election to the chair of the work and pensions committee be look forward to share through the secretary of state for work and pensions the work that our departments be do together particularly on the link between mental health and unemployment and on integrate pathway she be right about the social determinant of ill health that be why be genuinely excited that through the mission drive approach that the prime minister have set out we be already bring together whitehall departments traditionally siloe to work together on attack those social determinant the real game changer be genuine cross departmental working alongside business civil society and all of we as active citizen to mobilise the whole country in pursuit of that national mission in which we will be tough on ill health and tough on the cause of ill health as someone might have say call the father of the house greatly respect the secretary of state and as an old person who rely on the nhs support his radical zeal repeat what he say in his statement cancer be more likely to be death sentence for nhs patient than for patient in other country we have have this conversation previously but can he at least look at the health system in other country particularly those in the netherlands australia france and germany those country which have wonderful health system protect the vulnerable use mixture of social insurance and public and private fund to maximise input into their health service every time the right hon gentleman praise my zeal for nhs reform labour members get very nervous let reassure he that have look at other country and will definitely continue to do that genuinely do not think that it be the model of funding that be the issue the publicly fund public service element hope that he know well enough to understand that if do think so would be more than happy making and would quite enjoy take on the argument but think that the equitable principle that underpin our nhs be one that we should cherish and protect the single payer model have enormous potential for the century of big datum ai and machine learning there be huge potential there that we must unlock but that do not mean that we can not learn from the way that other country organise care particularly in the community and particularly social care this week meet virtually with my friend the health minister in singapore will continue to work with my international counterpart to learn from other country whose health outcome be far well than our in my constituency of north warwickshire and bedworth patient wait far too long for gp appointment the conservative party have preside over stick plaster solution paper over the crack in our health service rather than make it fit for the future do the secretary of state agree that today report be chance to get the right diagnosis of the problem so that this new labour government can come up with the right prescription and my constituent can once again get the treatment that they so desperately need be delighted to see my hon friend in her place she be absolutely right we will take lord darzi diagnosis to write the prescription and ensure that our reform agenda benefit every part of the country not just big city and the wealthy community so that every person wherever they be from grow up and live have access to the very good health and care service key finding in the darzi report be that nhs staff morale be low the medical defence union of medical practitioner state recently that more than of nhs staff will reduce the number of hour that they work because of low morale will the secretary of state meet representative of the union to explore those issue and work out way of improve staff morale of course we seek to work constructively with all trade union represent staff across our health and care service and also with the royal college we want to work in spirit of partnership and we be only able to do so because people send labour mps to parliament to replace the conservatives agree with my right hon friend this be the most devastating analysis that have read of the nhs in over year it just show the challenge that lie before he talk of challenge will he challenge the integrate care board to focus on move resource into primary care in particular will he look at what be happen in york where nimbuscare have be able to pull out service from the acute sector and deliver work in the community be really grateful to my hon friend for her question she have huge amount of expertise in health and care and she be absolutely right about the need for that shift have make it very clear to icb leader and to trust across the country that want more focus on secondary prevention which mean much more activity in the neighbourhood know that she will keep on champion these cause she be good critical friend and know that she will hold my foot to the fire to ensure that deliver declare my interest as the husband of an nhs doctor also serve as non executive director of my local nhs trust the last time that lord darzi be bring into service be by labour government shortly before they appoint he to the house of lords will the secretary of state take step to ensure the wide possible input from senior clinician it be clear that some include professor sir john bell do not share lord darzi prescription for the improvement of the nhs will he also apologise to my constituent for the doubt that he have cast over the future of the new hillingdon hospital on which work have already start under the previous government be not sure that be fair characterisation of sir john bell position have huge amount of respect for he be grateful to lord darzi for write the diagnosis give that the conservative party be in government for year repeatedly promise to rebuild hillingdon hospital and leave my department in position where the money for the new hospital programme run out in march the hon member have some brass neck to point the finger at we while he be in opposition in the horton hospital in my constituency lose its consultant lead maternity unit temporary downgrade that end up be make permanent three year later be it not about time that someone from the conservative party apologise for the damage do to banbury hospital as well as to the nhs as whole be delighted to see my hon friend here his constituent can already see that he be not backwards in come forwards he will stand up and champion their interest in this house as great constituency mp when it come to the conservative party sorry seem to be the hard word welcome the announcement of the secretary of state about the shift from hospital to community care my fellow liberal democrats and fully believe that fix social care be part of the solution in get the nhs back on its foot so also welcome the announcement of national care service part of care in the community be of course the hospice sector recently meet the chief executive of st catherine hospice which be in the constituency of the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies he highlight to that although the hospice have bed it be currently use only of they what assurance can the secretary of state give and people right across the country that fix the hospice sector will be part of the solution as we take the nhs forward be so grateful for that question not least because it give the chance as constituency mp to say huge thank you to st francis hospice and haven house child hospice for the care they provide to constituent like so many other hospice around the country know that the sector be under real pressure we look forward to work with the sector throughout the period of the spending review and the year plan not only to support our hospice but to improve end of life care which be pertinent to debate that know this house and the other place will have about how we ensure good death for everyone in every part of the country on tuesday be at the birmingham child hospital will the secretary of state join in congratulate the excellent staff on their work and their commitment to each individual patient who go through the door that evening be also with local gp at sparkbrook health centre dr abid bhatti whose frustration be with the outdated computer system if he could get one message across to the secretary of state it would be that he have to reboot his computer numerous time day will the secretary of state put resource in to ensure that the it be up to date first my hon friend be right that we should celebrate and thank staff who be do an outstanding job against very difficult set of circumstance on his second point we have to ensure that on the tech side we unlock productivity in the system have literally sit look over the shoulder of gps at their it system well understand those frustration for the benefit of all observer there be sometimes perception that be up against nhs staff when it come to reform actually it be staff who be cry out for change one aim of the lansley reform be to transfer from ministers to clinician decision on the day to day run of the health service it be not clear from his statement whether the secretary of state intend to change that process but let give he constructive proposal that he might take on board which be to streamline the business planning side of the nhs staff have to go through multiple bid and preparation of business plan before decision be make that mean that more money be spend on employ business consultant than consultant in hospital have campaign for this change for many year will he take that on board interruption the minister for secondary care be whisper in my ear that it be her frustration with exactly the bureaucratic process that the hon gentleman describe that lead to she seek election as member of parliament to sort they out so defer to she on this one on serious note he be right that wherever we find waste and inefficiency design in we must deal with it want to see an nhs that be more clinically lead free from political interference we must also be honest as it be such an enormous part of the public sector which the public pay an enormous price for and value so much there will always need to be an accountability relationship what have try to build with nhs england in the last couple of month with real joy in the process be real team between the department of health and social care and nhs england as well as the team across the country look forward to continue to galvanise that team as we embark on the year plan process in my constituency staggering of patient say that it be not easy at all to get through to someone at their gp practice bad the figure for patient who say that do this be generally easy be far below the national average do the secretary of state agree that the conservatives have push the nhs to break point and only this government can get the nhs fit for the future be delighted to see my hon friend in her place stand up for her community in penistone and stocksbridge in opposition it be very frustrating watch successive minister promise well hold music for people try to get through to their gp rather than solve the problem of access fix general practice and build general practice so that it can meet the need of this century will be vital part of our year plan process may make the secretary of state little more nervous the darzi report make seven high level recommendation the fourth of which be to drive productivity in hospital from in south essex we see merger of basildon chelmsford and southend hospital to create the mid and south essex nhs hospital trust it have not be an unmitigated success as local mp we be promise significant back office saving that could be channel into patient care in fact the reverse have be true and there have be such turnover of senior manager in that trust in recent year it have be like game of musical chair the trust be now try to appoint three permanent manager and director for each hospital to provide stability which make sense but be offer salary of for each post which be more than the prime minister earn to run the country now that this be on his watch will the secretary of state take personal interest we should pay good rate for that job but send the wrong signal to all the other very hard work people in the trust thank the right hon gentleman for that question he be not too far away from geographically but he be mile away from politically and always get nervous when he stand up to praise we have to keep sharp eye on value for money the darzi report present some politically challenging message about nhs management could be wildly popular with the country if stand up and say go to take the axe to management across the country and sack load of manager what we need be well management and sharp eye on value for money the nhs would not work without good leadership we have to ensure that we have the right people in the right place deliver against the public expectation so it be more nuanced position but be sure that what he say will have be hear by his local trust will certainly keep an eye on value for money across the country the darzi report rightly say that prevention be well than cure and that public health intervention that protect health be far less costly than tackle the consequence of illness and ill health do my right hon friend agree that the recklessness and incompetence of the year of conservative government strip million of pound from local authority which deliver the public health work have contribute to child be sicker than they be year ago and adult get iller soon my hon friend be right and at some point the conservatives will have to take responsibility for it we learn through bitter experience that if we do not change as party the country would not choose to change the government long may the conservatives continue therefore with their head in the sand and long may we continue to get on with the job of clear up their mess and build an nhs that be fit for the future the relationship between the nhs and local government and between my department and local government be of particular importance in relation to social care which be why be especially delighted that the prime minister choose this week to appoint tom riordan the chief executive of leeds city council as second permanent secretary he be an outstanding public servant with demonstrable record on health and care integration public health and prevention look forward to have that local government perspective and local community delivery perspective at the heart of our department think the whole house agree with what the secretary of state say in his statement the nhs need reform in reality when speak to people in the nhs almost all of they say that this be not about shortage of money but about the legendary level of waste bureaucracy and mismanagement indeed the report refer specifically to the huge number of regulator accountant and bureaucrat from the top down be there recognition among the nhs senior leadership that management reform be critical part of improve healthcare in the united kingdom welcome the hon member to his place and thank he for that question be always cynical about huge volume of regulation we reassure ourselves as legislator and regulator that put regulation in place mean that we have deal with the issue but the problem be that if we fail to deliver we put another regulation in place then another and then more and before we know it we have drown the people responsible for delivery in so much regulation that they can not sort the wheat from the chaff or see the wood for the tree compromising standard and patient safety that be why welcome the work that penny dash have do in relation to the care quality commission and we will continue to work with she to reduce the burden of regulation focus on the thing that really matter and free nhs staff from red tape hope that he find that reassuring plead with he not to send his party leader to agree with as well or really will be in trouble declare an interest as the mother of an nhs nurse it be important that we remember what be at the centre of this issue people three individual come to my carlisle surgery last week because they be at the end of their tether about the care that their love one have receive or not receive at our local hospital one be the husband of woman who have profound physical disability and can not leave the house unaccompanie she now have no trust in her local hospital because among other thing her recent care involve she be feed food that she be know to be allergic to also see the parent of young woman who have epilepsy physical disability and profound anxiety the failure to put in place care plan to account for all that mean that she be now self harm the other case be that of an elderly woman whose husband be discharge from the hospital without her consent he be now in care home mile away and she can not visit he will the secretary of state assure those people that this government will not only fix our nhs but restore their break trust in it be so grateful to my hon friend enjoy visit her carlisle constituency ahead of the general election campaign and look forward to work with she to improve health service there and across the north west especially in the rural and coastal community that rely on the hospital in carlisle as well as on more local neighbourhood service must warn new member that one of the most depressing thing about the last nine year have be constituency advice surgery where people would come to see we about the consequence of the failure of government and the failure of this place we owe it to they to do well well integration of health and care service well access and outcome and well join up care as she have painfully describe if we do not tackle the problem early they become multiple high cost and personal tragedy we have see enough of that famously the house have not see an impact assessment of the withdrawal of the winter fuel allowance from frail and year old on low income have lord darzi or the secretary of state see an assessment of the impact of that decision on nhs bed capacity over the come winter the hon member be an experienced member of this house as both former chair of the treasury committee and former treasury minister so she know how impact assessment be do at the treasury she know that impact assessment of all the chancellor fiscal decision at the budget and the spending review will be publish at that time she also know suspect that despite the withdrawal of the winter fuel allowance from some pensioner it will be target at those most in need they will still be well off because the government have commit to maintain the triple lock and to extend the warm home discount scheme and the available hardship support so that pensioner be not leave behind as we clean up the billion mess that the conservatives leave behind lord darzi report lay bare the scale of the challenge that our nhs face do the secretary of state share my deep concern that because of the conservative party dismal record the progress make by the previous labour government on heart disease and stroke of which have have recent personal experience be now in reverse the number of people in england die from cardiovascular disease before the age of have rise to its high level in year be delighted to see my hon friend in the house represent my old east end stomp ground wish she and her husband well in his recovery and for their recovery as family from his experience let reassure she that when it come to the future of health and social care we will clean up the mess that the conservatives make that will take time the reverse in the progress make on cardiovascular disease and the early warning sign of an uptick in smoking be why we must put public health and prevention at the forefront that be not just about what be good for the individual their health and their chance look at what the office for budget responsibility say today about the long term cost to the exchequer we have no choice but to act key conclusion of the report be the absolute necessity of focus on productivity and not just throw money at the nhs think we all agree on that minister be constantly tell we that government be about make difficult decision something that that we already know why then on one of his first opportunity do the secretary of state do the absolute opposite of that in solve the doctor dispute he take the easy option of throw money at it and do not require productivity enhancement and change will he reassure that in future he will practise what he preach like the hon gentleman very much but what audacity to criticise this government for clean up the conservatives mess he fail to acknowledge the cost to the exchequer and to patient in delay and cancel operation appointment and procedure more than billion have be lose and more than million appointment cancel because of the conservatives gross incompetence and failure to understand the difference they be penny wise and pound foolish that be why they have be send into opposition and labour have be trust to clean up their mess there can be no great example of the previous government failure than the shocking outcome for our child and young people as lord darzi report highlight our child now have some of the bad health outcome in europe with high rate of obesity diabete and asthma and poor oral and mental health from head to toe they have be fail will the secretary of state ensure that the government long term plan for our nhs will give young people health the priority that it deserve be delighted to see my hon friend in her place she might be from the wrong side of the river but she be absolutely right about the importance of prioritise child health as the prime minister say this morning it be shocking that the no cause of hospital admission among child age between six and be tooth decay be criticise by the shadow secretary of state who say that call our child short and fat she be more outraged by my call out the scourge of childhood obesity that her government fuel than she be by the scourge of child obesity itself that be why we will act and why the conservatives fail welcome the fact that the health secretary talk about shift from hospital to community care that build on lord darzi find that of bed be occupy by people who be wait for care in more appropriate setting care for patient in community hospital be much more cost effective than care for patient in big acute hospital like the royal devon and exeter hospital where live what think have the secretary of state give to the use of community hospital that have lose bed in the last decade such as seaton axminster honiton and ottery st mary the hon gentleman be absolutely right about the value of community hospital step down accommodation and care close to people home or well still wherever possible in their home so long as it be clinically safe and the right support and care be available the shift from hospital to community will be at the heart of our year plan for reform and modernisation like lot of his colleague on the liberal democrat benches and lot of those on the government benches behind the hon gentleman have already do good job of put his local lobbying of ministers on the record in the house rise order be aim to end this statement at pm remind member that anyone who be not in for the start of the statement will not be call recent survey of staff at east kent hospitals university nhs foundation trust show that less than half of employee would be happy for their love one to be treat at an east kent hospital that be devastating verdict from staff show the impact on their morale and on confidence in the community for the care that people need do the secretary of state agree however that broken nhs be not the fault of staff like they but down to the previous government decade of austerity and top down reorganisation of the nhs be delighted to see my hon friend in her place she be absolutely right feel really sorry for nhs staff for what they have be put through over more than decade of mismanagement and political incompetence and we will work with they to clean up the mess she establish exactly the right test which be whether we would want our love one to be treat in our local health and care service and whether we would have confidence that in every case on every occasion and in every interaction they would have access to the good quality care the truth be that we do not have that certainty and too often it feel like chance that be why we will always put the patient voice the patient interest and the patient experience at the heart of our reform and modernisation programme thank the secretary of state for the honesty in his statement and for his contact with the regional minister responsible at the northern ireland assembly those be the first action of secretary of state who suggest do not run away from issue but take they head on congratulate he on that appreciate the terminology use in the report which outline the seriousness of condition in the nhs but also highlight the fact that the vital sign be still strong will the secretary of state outline how he intend to address the fact that the nhs in devolved region be in an arguably bad condition will he confirm that the review will incorporate northern ireland and will he ensure that the finding new practice and standard will be in place for northern ireland along with increase funding in new funding formula thank the hon gentleman for what he say come from he that mean great deal to reassure he that be committed to work with ministers in all devolve administration to improve health outcome for everyone in every part of our united kingdom know that the system be particularly press in northern ireland and will do whatever can work with ministers in northern ireland to help that situation and create the rise tide that lift all ship right across the uk truly learn to appreciate the nhs when become parent and see the care give to my family and child it therefore horrify have sit in with an ill child to see in lord darzi report that infant wait for over six hour in last year do the secretary of state agree that that be shocking state in which to leave the nhs will he commit to bring the number down and make sure that parent do not have to endure that terrible wait be delighted to see my hon friend represent calder valley he have capture the fear and anxiety about the length of the wait experience by far too many parent when they access department it be terrifying experience particularly for parent with small child to be in that situation frankly the lack of focus on paediatric waiting list and waiting time whether in or for elective really be shameful we have get to put child first and that be exactly what this government will do my constituent in bournemouth west have face rise nhs waiting time we have gp surgery close despite rise population and health burden there be no dentist accept any nhs adult patient and resident be be tell to go to southampton and the junior doctor and nurse meet be devastate that they can not deliver the quality of service that they want to do the secretary of state agree that although the road ahead be long lord darzi frank and raw assessment be the first step to recovery under labour government be delighted to see my hon friend in her place represent the people of bournemouth the great thing about where we be at this moment be that for the first time in long time there be feeling of hope and optimism about what the future could be we be determined to build on that and give staff and patient the confidence of know that the good day for the nhs lie ahead lord darzi report highlight the use of capital expenditure to cover in year spending by successive tory governments money intend

they host the prime minister this morning that unlike our predecessor this government can not get enough of expert that conclude the statement we have have more than contribution from back benchers so thank you for your patience point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker we be all passionate about our hospice our hospital our gp practice and the other health service that our constituent get come to this place be not for the faint hearted but be it appropriate for the secretary of state for health and social care to adopt the tone that he bring to the chamber early as say we be all passionate but perhaps his tone his bedside manner may say need new approach on occasion note his more collegial tone later in the statement but to tell opposition hon member we be all hon member in this place to sit down and listen or to liken some previous holder of his role to arsonist and similar paraphernalia be not befit of this chamber far to that point of order madam deputy speaker like the hon lady very much and will just say two thing in response first she have be around in this chamber long time conservative members can not sit and heckle then get cross when ministers respond robustly secondly think that be perfectly legitimate analogy indeed might say that the arsonist should not complain about the fire brigade remind all hon member that good temper and moderation be the characteristic of good debate on point of order madam deputy speaker you will recall that have raise in the house the use of crossbow by criminal these be lethal weapon the previous government add to the list of weapon that be ban and the current government be implement those measure have you have any notice of statement be bring to the house by minister to respond to the increasingly press cry

person commit or prepare an act of terrorism and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time monday october and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en sir david amess adjournment debate motion make and question propose that this house have consider matter to be raise before the forthcoming wakeford be honour to open this debate in the memory of our great friend my great friend sir david amess fall comrade whose plaque be look at right now it be on the other side of the chamber just above where he use to sit appropriately enough it be directly opposite that of jo cox another fall comrade who grace this house while she be here as there be number of new member in the chamber maybe nervously wait to make their maiden speech remember that feeling too perhaps could explain why we call this debate the sir david amess debate it be not just in honour of his service but because he be past master at make use of it in essence david would manage to cram vast number of different topic usually relate to his constituency into very small amount of time from memory the all time record be different subject in minute each of which mysteriously lead to subsequent press release he basically turn it into an art form and as result the end of term adjournment debate be always know in the commons tea room as the sir david amess debate as such after his loss mr speaker and the house authority decide to turn that from de facto to de jure and formalise it by give the debate his name be delighted that we have do so because it help to keep his name alive hon member hear hear will the right hon gentleman give way yes of course even on the adjournment commend the right hon gentleman on the speech he be make every one of we who have the pleasure of know sir david amess can picture he over on the far side of the chamber he be able to rattle off about thing at some speed every one of they pertinent to his constituency but he do it with grace and respect that we all love and we miss he dearly be it the right hon gentleman intention to do the item in about minute no can reassure the hon gentleman and the house that only intend to raise three topic before my right hon friend leave the subject of sir david whom first meet in the in different place and when be briefly in different party ask he to confirm my recollection that in all those many year can not think of single occasion when david say mean unkind or unfair thing about anyone there be not many people about whom one can say that and for one regard he as an inspiration generally agree with my right hon friend particularly about defence matter and he have sum my great friend up very well at the end of my speech however will make small revelation about david and the general election which hope colleague will find amusing of course david amess be famous back bencher he spend his career in this place entirely on the back benches during the year that be on the front bench try to do all kind of thing but be absolutely certain that david amess achieve far more than ever do speak from the back benches that tell story of its own as david illustrate it be perfectly possible to make huge difference from all part of this house not only to one constituent but to this place think my right hon friend be be too modest about his own achievement that be probably true hope hansard get that want to raise three specific topic the first be animal welfare the second be local nhs service perhaps in non partisan way and the third and final be the story about the election to turn to animal welfare first david be an absolutely renowned animal lover he frequently raise number of animal welfare issue in this house and campaign for they passionately include by form alliance with people on the other side of the aisle as they would say in congress specifically he be patron of the conservative animal welfare foundation wonderful organisation run by two brilliant people christopher and lorraine platt it have actively campaign for number of year on animal welfare issue such as increase penalty for animal cruelty seek to ban import of hunt trophy and end the cruel use of farrow crate for sow and piglet it have succeed with one of those two more to go david be also serial entrant to the westminster dog of the year competition every year he would faithfully enter his dog and every year he would come back to his office full of faux outrage about the fact that for some inexplicable reason his dog have not be award the prize my office be around the corner on the same corridor and we always know to hide when david be come back from the competition except that in his final year he enter his french pug name vivienne she be name incidentally after julia roberts character in pretty woman only my mate could name pet after lady who earn her money in that way when david put vivienne in he be ask by local journalist why should member of the public vote for vivienne rather than one of the other dog his answer be because vivienne want southend to become city he win twice after he be murder southend do become city so we like to think he win in the end and on wave of public sympathy vivienne be indeed vote the westminster dog of the year my great friend the member for romford andrew rosindell and have the privilege of accept the award on david behalf with vivienne in tow be delighted to tell the house that be very honoured to have be ask to become patron of the conservative animal welfare foundation duty have proudly take up this week partly in david memory will attempt to match his legacy in campaign for animal welfare and be deeply indebted to the conservative animal welfare foundation for give that opportunity secondly david always have strong interest in the national health service he serve for many year as senior member of the health committee of this house declare an interest at this stage as be proud to say that my wife olivia work as senior neuroradiographer in the nhs and have do for many year be very proud of what she and all the other staff of the national health service achieve for we day in and day out have the privilege of go on ride out with the east of england ambulance service few week ago be accompany by senior paramedic name emily who show the ambulance service in action we be in an emergency response vehicle and be immensely impressed not just by her professionalism but by her empathy with the people with whom she come into contact an absolute professional be pleased to report that while the east of england ambulance service have be through turbulent time it be in special measure for while it come out of special measure under the leadership of its previous chief executive tom abell whereas before there be often dozen ambulance in the car park early on thursday evening when we go to southend hospital as part of my ride out there be only three however there be an issue at southend because the unit be shall we say not very well design there be very narrow entrance to it such that if there be trolley in the corridor it be very difficult to get people in and out so be pleased to report that the hospital trust have secure million of capital to completely rebuild with proper purpose design entrance that ambulance can back into and discharge their patient from more quickly the first phase of that will hope open prior to christmas and it will also be possible to expand capacity in and to treat more patient more quickly that be something david and his successor anna firth campaign for very hard and he would be pleased to know that campaign some year ago to expand primary care in my constituency help to get an expansion of audley mills surgery in rayleigh and have be involve in campaign to expand two other the riverside medical centre in hullbridge and the jones family practice in hockley as it happen tom abell have now take over as the chief executive of the new mid and south essex integrate care board and have meeting with he about these surgery only week or so ago be pleased to report to the house that it be very positive meeting and be therefore hopeful that we will be able to secure those expansion do say that would tell the house about the general election but be not sure whether what be about to reveal have previously be in the public domain for context in basildon be one of the large constituency in the country so in the early the boundary review basically divide it in two along the arterial road david never like the term safe seat because he feel it imply that one take one constituent for grant which he palpably never do however the pundit say that safe tory seat have be create around billericay to the north of the and safe labour seat have be create in basildon new town so at the time it be regard as one all draw but tory sacrificial lamb still have to come along and fight this seat so along come david amess he have fight newham seat at the general election in his late and at age he become the conservative candidate for basildon the campaign do not get off to an auspicious start in those day electoral law require that prospective candidate should have formal meeting at which they would be legally adopt by their party david local association have hire the northlands community centre in pitsea to have the meeting unfortunately there have be miscommunication and when they arrive the place be padlock up there be no mobile phone in those day so colleague be immediately dispatch to nearby telephone box to try to get the council caretaker to come and open the community centre these effort prove unsuccessful by now it be approach dusk so he be adopt as the parliamentary candidate while stand under lamp post in the community centre car park and thus he go into battle david be david he fight feisty campaign there be lot of music and balloon and it be all very high profile however as he tell when we have supper few year ago he think that he be go to lose but that he would go down fighting so in the run up to the count he write defiant speech say that although he have be defeat margaret thatcher would surely win the election and carry the torch forward he arrive at the election count arm with this speech steel himself for what be to come as hon member will know at an election count there be moment before the result be read out when the return officer call the candidate and agent together to go through the result with they first and to make sure there be no irregularity and no one want recount the call go out for candidate and agent and david walk across there be small huddle around the return officer who turn to david and say we ve complete the count and there be clear winner well do mr amess you win david look at he and say what and the chap say you ve win you ve be elect you the member of parliament for basildon go to read it out in five minute time hope you ve get your speech ready david look at the return officer in awe and say could you just give one moment he dash into the gent rip off some loo paper and jot down some bullet point because obviously the speech he have prepare be no long appropriate and he go out on to the stage for the record he win by vote the result be read out and he observe all the courtesy and he thank the return officer and other officer for conduct an efficient count he thank the police for maintain order and then he say never doubt for one moment that would win this seat always know that by fight an active and lively campaign would be elect to represent the people of basildon in the house of commons and so it be sheer chutzpah literally from the first moment those of we who know he know that he carry on like that for the rest of his career and that be why the house love he david always have great concern for all colleague on all side of the house so if he be here now he would be think of those about to make their maiden speech and he would say something like do worry do be nervous you be absolutely fine and of course you will after all you work very hard to get here even if you be not adopt under lamp post so lady and gentleman it be wonderful to have this debate in his name and thank the house and the chair for the great honour of be allow to open it to all those who be about to make their first speech in parliament say wish you all the very good of luck but not too much david amess be my mentor as he be for many colleague and he help become good constituency mp he also spend time with we especially colleague who feel threatened or unsafe he give we his time for nothing we all miss he call daniel francis to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for allow the opportunity to make my maiden speech in this debate it be an honour to follow the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois have serve with his brother on my local council year ago wish to add to his tribute to sir david amess and jo cox would like to start by pay tribute to my predecessor sir david evennett who represent our local area for year first in the former erith and crayford constituency and then in bexleyheath and crayford he take keen interest in education serve twice as parliamentary private secretary in the education department he be elect with the other sir david in and they be close friend and it be apt that this debate be name after sir david amess sir david evennett be the only conservative member of parliament to lose their seat in and then regain it at the second attempt in which say great deal about his tenacity and wish he and marilyn happy and healthy retirement note that when sir david evennett make his maiden speech in he follow and compliment the then member for sedgefield who of

an industrial past with the thames at the north of the constituency but today most job be in manufacturing retail and hospitality however that past help change history and ensure that britain be the country it be today the vickers work be locate in crayford for year from and during the world war they manufacture the vickers machine gun aircraft naval gun lay equipment and the casing for the barnes wallis bounce bomb of dambusters fame famously it be where the british aviator john alcock and arthur brown manufacture the first vickers vimy bomber with the first manufacture in crayford while it be the thirteenth manufacture elsewhere which in make the first non stop transatlantic flight that history of our constituency continue today with my constituent across barnehurst bexleyheath crayford northumberland heath slade green and the small part of abbey wood belvedere erith and well that represent work hard and deliver for our country every day speak to local resident who work in the public sector and know how grateful their neighbour be for the work they do and on which we all rely my constituent rely on train service provide by thameslink and southeastern which have depot in slade green where they maintain roll stock and train staff it be those railway worker who keep my constituent on the move those commuter work in the financial and professional job that london rely on but also importantly in shop restaurant and hotel keep london economy move and if we take quick glance around any road in my constituency we see variety of white van and black taxi demonstrate that my constituent be the worker that london rely on to get they from to and the builder plumber brickie and lift engineer who will help we grow our economy but there be one set of worker on which our community really do rely our volunteer and carer today my day start as many other will have do lift my child from her bed change her nappy dress she feed she and tidy her hair and then ensure that she be in her wheelchair and ready for her transport to collect she for school our child be twin but will lead very different path in life one talk of future in work and the journey she will make the other after many year of work from professional can now manage to talk but her language be limit to about dozen word the eld of our twin have cerebral palsy and range of complex disability like other carer the great concern that my wife and have be what will happen to she when we be go many of we know what it be like to have to work and educate our child at home for month during the covid pandemic in our case this be stretch by the fact that one of our child require full time care our family network and carer be not allow into our home and my wife be undergo chemotherapy at the time she be now thankfully recover due to the fantastic work of our incredible nhs can assure members that in my time in this house will be the great of champion for carer and the disabled because really do know the challenge that family in our position face on daily basis have to fight the local authority because either it have not transfer the money to pay the carer or it be not pay at rate that meet minimum wage requirement the constant battle to ensure that our child have wheelchair that work the argument over which part of the public sector will fund the person require to cut our child food at lunchtime because the education health and care plan be not clear on the matter could take the easy path and sit at home rather than be here take difficult decision to fix the inheritance bequeath to this government but believe that this house really do need people like who know how badly reform be need in the special educational need system and for the right of carer my constituent like rely on volunteer and charity across the constituency be not go to name they because be bind to miss one out but those charity know that have the great admiration for they have work alongside they for many

open this debate thank the leader of the house for respond to my request at business question last week to properly entitle this debate the sir david amess adjournment debate persuade sir david to join the backbench business committee purely by undertake that we would always ensure pre recess adjournment debate to which he could contribute his self interest be clear even then it be fitting that this be the first sir david amess adjournment debate since the release of the grenfell inquiry report because sir david be my immediate predecessor as chairman of the all party parliamentary fire safety and rescue group the inquiry report be incredibly comprehensive and make for terrible reading strongly suggest that all member read at least the executive summary the full report be of daunting size it be clear that government of all persuasion badly let down people in this country and in particular the people of grenfell the all party group try relentlessly to bring forward urgent change to building safety but they be refuse jason beer kc represent the department at the inquiry even apologise on behalf of the government for not listen properly to what the all party group be say sir david say if government have listen to we grenfell would not have occur be glad he have be vindicate on that but be very sad that he be not here to hear that deadly fire do not just happen they be the result of series of failure over number of year on number of level there be number of alarming similarity between grenfell and the king cross fire which claim life back in although sir martin mention it only once in his report remember it vividly be commuter to central london at the time just as sir martin report have do sir desmond fennell report on the king cross fire identify key failing over several year across many public body that could have prevent the fire from spread out of control the similarity do not end there they include inadequate fire training the use of unsafe material and the failing of the london fire brigade it be alarm how similar the two fire be despite be deal with by totally different department sir martin talk about improve the cross government response wonder what would have happen if the lesson learn about unsafe building material at king cross be implement across all departments welcome the government promise to respond to the recommendation within six month but we need to get the ball roll on the legislative change that sir martin recommend soon rather than later it will take long time to get the legislation right to get it through committee in both houses and on to the statute book and then to find the solution to the problem of the regulatory gap as matter of priority we can not wait six month for white paper urge the government to consider at least that key point urgently let we get the legislation lay before this house as soon as possible that lead on to the scandal of the remedial work require to fix building up and down the country that be still coat in dangerous cladding the recommendation from king cross to replace wooden escalator take until to be complete surely the cladding replacement can not take year as well but the start have not be great there be another question about this work who will pay for it be adamant that it should not be leaseholder and tenant they be the one group who have do nothing wrong and hope that the government will address that point on monday be pleased to be elect unopposed that be mode of election that welcome as chairman of the backbench business committee it have terrific honorificabilitudinity that lead neatly to my tribute to my predecessor in the role ian mearns serve as chairman for nine year and as the member of parliament for gateshead for year be sure that the new hon member for gateshead central and whickham mark ferguson will be as dedicate servant to the people of that community and hope that my chairmanship will live up to ian legacy my other role be chairman of the committee you will remember the role well madam deputy speaker have be vice chairman for the benefit of members who be wonder when the prime minister will face new opponent at lunchtime on wednesday let say that we have conclude the second ballot of mps further ballot will occur after the party conference and there will be new leader in november thank the officer on the somewhat small team than in previous year namely my hon friend the member for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown who have be elect to the august role of chairman of the public accounts committee and my hon friend the member for stockton west matt vickers for be so efficient in help with the ballot over the past couple of week move on to transport this be the first opportunity have have to talk about the new part of my constituency that come in after the boundary change be sure that parlyapp will be pleased to hear that will not give history of queensbury from to but there be two interesting titbit on the history of queensbury station the branch from wembley park to stanmore begin life as part of the metropolitan railway in the final fling of the met as private venture government members should perhaps note that all four of the tube station in my constituency result from private investment and initiative not government diktat when queensbury station be build around year ago there be no development in the area and the company could not decide what to call it the local authority adjacent to the area be kingsbury so naturally it be name queensbury that lead on to bittersweet point about queensbury station while it be nice to gain queensbury it be yet another tube station in my constituency without step free access those who follow these debate closely will know that have raise the issue of stanmore station before it be in dire need of lift as it have about million passenger entry and exit year continue to bang the drum and to point out to the mayor of london transport for london and the department for transport that stanmore be not step free in fact it force disabled user to wheel themselves through car park and up steep ramp on the other side even one of our great paralympians can not do it unaided it be completely inadequate as step free entrance and public lift be badly need so that the step that people be mean to use while enter or exit the station can be circumvent be disappointed that my plea seem consistently to fall upon deaf ear but here be warning will continue to campaign until we get lift at stanmore station and the other station in my constituency we be all conscious in this house of the escalate situation in the middle east there be clear and present danger that if terrorist remain in gaza there will be no long term resolution to the conflict indeed hezbollah iran and the extremist force in the middle east could be drag into full scale war with israel which none of we want be therefore concerned about several turn by the government which want correct many of we who be friend of israel be alarm by the message that be send by the government suspend arm licence it give the impression that in the government eye israel and hamas be the same but let we be clear they be not and the government should not treat they as such be chair of the all party parliamentary group on uk israel and as we come to the one year anniversary of the october attack which be the large loss of jewish life since the holocaust israel need the uk support not censure on june labour say that if elect it would proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps as many of we have call on the conservative government to do for number of year on july the guardian report that this government would not proscribe the irgc as terrorist group which be complete turn be concerned that anything but proscription be simply cop out particularly give that israel iran tension be escalate there need to be government action on defence spending we have commitment from the previous government to raise defence spending first to of gdp and then to we now seem to have road map from the government towards spend give the challenge that our defence industry face we need to take appropriate action my supported housing regulatory oversight act from the last parliament mandate the government to establish support housing advisory panel within month of the act be pass the sift date be list as july but nothing have be hear since as of august that be overdue and technically that put the secretary of state in breach of the law urge she to get the job under way and to ensure that we set up the panel be conscious that other colleague want to contribute so will mention only one or two other thing on the potential free trade deal with india the last government promise it by diwali they forget which year but both side decide to put negotiation on hold because of election here and of course in india those election be now over and the government have settle into place so let we get on with the job of get the free trade agreement that everyone want at business question mention the tobacco and vapes bill which wholeheartedly support in the last parliament javed khan review on achieve smoke free ought to be implement in full hope that the government will take on board the various cross party amendment propose to the bill so that we can get over any objection from the industry and progress that legislation swiftly be delighted that the government have take forward the plan for holocaust memorial and learn centre in victoria garden strongly support that also chair the all party group on holocaust memorial we recently hear from holocaust survivor eve who reiterate our plea to get the memorial build before the survivor unfortunately pass away we be see huge increase in antisemitism that be clearly scandal there have not be government statement on bangladesh the government in bangladesh have be displace and there be human right catastrophe particularly for the hindu population yet we have hear nothing from the government hope that we will hear what the government will do to safeguard bangladeshi citizen finally on local issue turn to edgware towers there be proposal in the neighbouring constituency to build block of high density multi storey flat the tall of which would be storey would be above storey high that be in cramped area most important be the proposal to build bus garage for electric bus under storey tower block give the fire that have take place on electric bus the consequence be unthinkable

eminently worthwhile read although all those outstanding individual have now go the example they set will long continue to inspire those who know they and generation yet to come in the time remain shall return to continue constitutional issue which previously raise in the debate on the king speech with the election of select committee chairs have just take place we must hope that the prime minister after consult the leader of the opposition will soon present to the house nomination for membership of intelligence and security committee of parliament the matter be press not just because the committee be about to complete key inquiry when the election be call but because of the fact that while there be no committee its dedicated expert staff be leave vulnerable to the tender mercy of some of those whom it oversee that be of serious concern for the benefit of new mp should explain that the isc be cross party committee of both houses of parliament create by statute under the justice and security act the isc have the legal responsibility for oversee the uk intelligence community on behalf of parliament and its member after confirmation in both houses its member choose their own chairman from among their nine member right hon and hon member may be surprised to learn that the isc office with very small number of staff belong to the cabinet office despite the isc oversee several sensitive organisation within the cabinet office they would be right to be surprised because that be indeed fundamental conflict of interest that be why at the time of the justice and security act the cabinet office be suppose to be only the temporary home of the isc office yet here we be more than year later with the committee staff still beholden to vulnerable within and unfairly pressured and even victimise by the very part of the executive the committee be charge with oversee the executive should not be able to constrain and control the committee democratic oversight on behalf of parliament by exert control over the committee small staff team to prevent they do their job independently such control mean that part of the cabinet office can and do starve the team of resource so that the isc staff be unable to fulfil the committee legal responsibility that be in complete contravention and disregard of clear ministerial undertaking give by the then deputy prime minister my right hon friend the member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden before the election it also mean that they can stigmatise and penalise the isc staff with damaging consequence for their career in the civil service the outgoing member of the isc value the committee staff very highly indeed and we find such treatment to be unacceptable in the last parliament the committee therefore formally resolve by unanimous vote across all three political party on the isc that it be essential for parliamentary democracy and its scrutiny system that the committee office must move out from under the control of the executive that is the cabinet office and should be establish instead as an independent body corporate with link to parliament rather than to the executive that unanimous decision be confirm by the member of the committee at its meeting on march follow expert and authoritative external advice that it be indeed within the isc power to take such step and to determine the suitable mechanism for implement it this constitutional change essential to protect the separation of power be easy to achieve it require very short amendment to the justice and security act to change the status of the isc office the amendment would establish an independent office to support the intelligence and security committee of parliament to safeguard the independence of the committee itself it have be hop that the amendment would be include in the new legislative programme unfortunately but unsurprisingly in the committee absence the cabinet office have hitherto manage to block it however this be to underestimate the previous member of the committee from both side of the house and in both chambers who be convince that the committee office can not and must not continue to be control by the cabinet office there be already in the legislative programme an obvious vehicle for achieve the necessary change the commonwealth parliamentary association and international committee of the red cross status bill be design to change the status of those two organisation it be therefore the obvious place to include short amendment to the justice and security act to change the status of the committee organisation too as measure to secure democratic oversight be confident that it should and would secure cross party support in both houses prior to the election both the then government and the then opposition seem to accept that this reform be need which do rather beg the question why it have not happen yet trust in conclusion that the government will ensure that this change be not be block somewhere by force unknown and will ensure that it be now take forward together with the emergency uplift in resource that be approve by the then deputy prime minister before the general election but which have be disregard by the cabinet office since this be urgently require if the new committee be to have sufficient efficient staff to be able to meet and function fully when it be reconstitute the government should recognise that this can not wait too much valuable time have be lose already call satvir kaur to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker want to start by congratulate hon friend and other hon member on some fantastic maiden speech today but also on the many have hear since the election in july they have make proud to be british however

safe in our street and neighbourhood again from have access to healthcare when it be need to protect our environment and river another key priority of mine be to ensure that we create opportunity for

evenly across our community and our country if we be to realise our potential we must ensure that those opportunity be spread more evenly too these challenge will not be easy to resolve but the people of southampton like so many across britain be rightfully proud and ambitious for themselves their family and their country that be why we need government who be equally ambitious and commit to unlock the potential and opportunity of place like southampton know that as city we stand ready to seize this moment to thrive and grow and the drive passion compassion togetherness and determination of the people of southampton will see it through let end by say directly to they will be forever grateful to you for make this daughter of market stall trader who grow up in our inner city on free school

arrive he say it nothing personal have my surgery tomorrow and can miss it he be someone who embody his constituency and put his constituency and his constituent first that be something that be share by all of we on both side of the house and we remember he particularly today as the new member for southend west and leigh have to say that on the doorstep in the constituency everyone know sir david amess or they think they know sir david amess and that be the sign of fantastic constituency mp although we may be different politically sir david be an amazing constituency mp in his name we be now city and that will continue to be recognise through the city day be introduce by the city council join the hon member in recognise sir david and his dedication to his constituent know that the hon gentleman be new member and think that intervention show the measure of the man that he will be in this house over the next four year judge by debate in which he participate yesterday know that he will be vocal advocate for his constituency and that he will make sir david very proud it be genuine honour to follow the maiden speech of the hon member for southampton test satvir kaur declare an interest because know the hon lady very well indeed we be both on southampton city council as councillor and in lead position and we both graduate from southampton university the hon member for bridgend chris elmore the whip on duty who will respond at the end of the debate be sure it be come should probably close his folder now and leave this out of his note but be actually the good man at the hon lady wedding and on my phone have video evidence of how good she be at dancing of how bad her husband ben be at dancing and of how good partyer she be at in the morning often call the hon lady mrs southampton because that be what she be we both care about southampton genuinely and passionately she be groundbreaking council leader she care about her city and she care about her constituent and she will be groundbreaking member of parliament will just remind she that secure more vote in southampton test than she do when stand in but do lose by so she do lot well than as be customary wish to raise few issue on behalf of my constituent promise that will not take too long because know that other member want to make their maiden speech and today be day for they particularly the hon member for winchester dr chambers my constituency neighbour and my hon friend the member for exmouth and exeter east david reed be watch he because he be in my flock in the opposition whips office and will be mark his homework later and know that he have two very special people wait in the gallery who probably want cup of tea so will keep my speech short have always speak in these debate because think it important to be able to raise issue on behalf of my constituent very quickly but also hope very thoroughly the first issue be one on which have be campaign for five year in the house the access for all funding that the last government award to number of station include two in my constituency hedge end and swanwick and the vital importance of ensure that our train station be accessible to people who be less able bodied than we be and to people with child particularly those with pushchair follow that five year campaign and two adjournment debate we finally receive the award but under the present government have be tell in letter that the feasibility study funding be under review that be disappointment to and to my constituent live in an area where there be excessive development build by the leadership of my local council as the area grow it be difficult for my constituent to travel to and from work use hedge end station they have to get off the train at southampton airport parkway mile away really hope that the hon member for bridgend will speak to the department for transport to ensure that member on both side of the house whose local station have be award access for all funding be give urgent clarification of whether they will receive it because many people in our constituency will rely on it be disappointed that the government have choose to place this under review hedge end will not require massive amount of money do not want to hear about billion black hole this be not enough money to make difference to in year spending that be the last party political point that shall make but the issue be important in my constituency and many other throughout the united kingdom the next issue be broadband and mobile phone signal lot of new development have be build in whiteley in my new constituency of hamble valley it have the infrastructure of number of old chocolate box village that inherit from the old constituency of winchester many young professional have buy home along the curbridge corridor and down into burridge and in this world of work from home they want to be able to conduct their business and their work life at home number of they receive fine because they can not pay their bill and number be get into trouble because they can not turn up to work be very interested in hear from the government on the investment maybe not necessarily today but hope they can allocate some time to debate the really important issue of digital desert across the united kingdom which be vital my new constituency be more rural than my old one and have pick up this issue across the whole of the constituency since become its member of parliament on july want to raise an issue that the government will hear about from in number of debate over the next five year we need walk in centre in whiteley in my constituency we have the fantastic fareham community hospital which have great diagnostic team it open its door to the local community and take some of the pressure off the primary care service that we have in other area of the constituency but we need to have more service at the hospital it be fantastic site and with its excellent leadership and staff have the capability to provide more primary care and more acute care hope that the government will look at allocate funding for walk in centre at fareham community hospital and in whiteley shopping centre lastly people who be watch we from the gallery or on television suspect there be not many do not see the hard work of the staff of this house particularly thank my office staff they be pay by

urgently deserve also want to draw attention to what will be key focus during my time here standard in public life we must always strive to be well if we be to retain public trust we all know that politic have the potential to change life immeasurably for the well yet all too often the public feel let down and there be perception that vested interest sometimes subsume those of constituent in need of support but it do not have to be like this that be why be proud to see the prime minister stress the importance of public service as we look ahead to the remainder of this parliament let we never forget why we be here and who we serve let we embrace the politic of unity which recognise that we can achieve lasting progress for our constituent by work together across party divide let we turn our back on the dog whistle politic that sow division the truth be that politics be far more difficult more nuanced and yes more fractious than many of we might like to admit end by draw an analogy between this place and my favourite pastime in my spare time be an avid white water kayaker navigate our river from source to sea the sport have take to far fling destination such as the nepalese himalayas the white nile in uganda as it flow north out of lake victoria and the upper reach of the alps white water kayaking be an assumed risk sport and it be team endeavour there be many obstacle to navigate on the way downstream blind corner that might belie tree block the entire river vicious recirculating feature that can trap kayaker whole and huge hidden waterfall can appear suddenly that be before we get to the effluence be discharge into our waterway the parallel to politic be strike even for those uninitiate in the dark art of navigate white water grow up have poster on my wall quote the chinese philosopher confucius it read one great glory be not in never fall but in rise every time one fall that be an apt quote for politic and one that we would all do well to

although exmouth and exeter east be new constituency it be create by amalgamate area from three previous constituency of which east devon be by far the large contributor refer to all my predecessor as be custom in maiden speech may therefore mark to the speaker office as someone who do not abide by time limit say this because all three of my predecessor have make significant contribution to local and national life simon jupp the former member for east devon work hard for his constituent and campaign relentlessly as chair of the all party parliamentary group for the great south west he help to secure investment into the region and always champion our part of the world consider simon to be friend and his contribution to this house will be miss as will his encyclopaedic knowledge of local

constituency and to give member flavour of the geography the history the settlement the people and the organisation that make my part of the world so irresistibly enchanting start at the mouth of the river exe go out to the heathland of woodbury common and finish in the countryside above the city of exeter the constituency of exmouth and exeter east have it all beautiful beach serene open and arable landscape the eastern part of thriving city vibrant town and picturesque village many part of my new constituency have be inhabit for several millennia with area such as topsham be settle by the celt turn into port by the romans and expand by the saxons possibly our most famous resident have be sir walter raleigh who be an elizabethan statesman soldier writer and explorer although he achieve much in his life will do my good not to meet the same fate which be to be try for treason before meet his end outside this chamber in old palace yard we have some fantastic organisation across exmouth and exeter east such as the royal national lifeboat institution which work tirelessly to keep local and tourist safe in the water around the constituency we have global expert work to advance the frontier of knowledge on weather and climate at the met office headquarters we have clinton devon estates which be ably responsible for the stewardship of much of the land in the southern area of the constituency as an example the clinton devon estates team work with the environment agency recently demonstrate to the world how to proactively regenerate land by complete the low otter restoration project as be to be expect we be fortunate to have some of the good farming produce anywhere in the country for those look to visit highly recommend stop in for pasty at darts farm or greendale farm shop however the organisation that have the most special place in my heart be commando training centre royal marines for decade the training camp in lympstone and the area of woodbury common have be the proving ground for all wannabe royal marines and for those from across our armed force who aspire to become commando have endure royal marine commando train over year ago be happy to announce that have learn once again to enjoy spend time on woodbury common without fear of be cold wet hungry and cover in gorse thistle the royal marines be proud organisation in its year in service to our country sadly it have become increasingly rare for former royal marine to enter this house as member however royal marines must share the same tendency that bus be afflict by none turn up for eon then four turn up at the same time although the other three former royal marines the hon and gallant members for plymouth moor view fred thomas for halesowen alex ballinger and for birmingham selly oak al carns opt to join the party now in government know that the kinship that bind royal marines together through share adversity will benefit this house and hope provide combative but constructive debate while exmouth and exeter east have much to be celebrate it also have its fair share of issue from an aged and degraded sewerage network to antisocial behaviour there be many issue that my constituent have place trust in to help improve for too long we have build new house in the area without deliver appropriate and corresponding infrastructure fear the new government top down housing target will far compound that issue and will do all can to ensure that the right mix of house be build in the right place with the right infrastructure and public consultation be also deeply concerned that large part of exmouth and exeter east will be tarmacke over within one generation of course we need new home for the next generation so that they can live near their friend family and work but we must have temper approach and ensure that we do not overdevelop and destroy our countryside and the culture of our historic town and village there be also area that will work hard to improve across exmouth and exeter east such as social care provision education scheme job opportunity transport link and support for farmer and those in rural affair it be worth voice that this new parliament bring the wind of political change to devon and the wide south west of england as new mp be open and willing to work with fellow south west mp regardless of political affinity to ensure we drive as much investment and opportunity as possible to our part of the world in join up way in an increasingly connected world believe our mps must have firm understanding of the national and international issue that affect we and most importantly how these issue affect our constituency for much of my adult life have fight hard in several organisation to keep our united kingdom safe and prosperous both in the physical and the digital environment we be on the precipice of new industrial revolution frontier technology such as artificial intelligence supercomputing and nanobiotechnology will radically change our world and the relationship we have with it it be imperative that the new government understand these issue and work across the public and private sector to ensure that our united kingdom remain technological global leader there be no get away from the fact that the international system be become more volatile it be deeply sad that conversation about international conflict be no long hypothetical war have break out across multiple global region and we must act without delay to increase defence spending to meet the threat that be clearly present anthropogenic climate change have long cease to be purely an academic debate it be visible and happen now we must continue to work closely with international partner to reduce our overall global carbon emission it be beyond faux pas to speak in communist tone from the conservative benches could risk make the same treasonous mistake as sir walter raleigh however there be modern resonance in lenin purport quote there be decade where nothing happen and there be week where decade happen in isolation any of the point have raise have the ability to cause mass societal and environmental change when decade happen in week become the new normal we must keep pace to ensure the united kingdom remain strong ally and ahead of the pack in an ever change world my final message be to the people of exmouth and exeter east who send to this house promise that will always fight for we and that will represent we to the good of my ability while have the privilege of serve as their member of

culture since primordial time music the visual art dance and drama provide an opportunity to walk in somebody else shoe they build more inquire society and help we to understand who we be and what it might be like to have somebody else experience they be also vital educational tool but in far too many case they be not staple in school or something that people have an adequate opportunity to engage

country to economic stability and renewal opportunity must be our watchword opportunity to help people get ahead in life through good job for example in the small and medium sized business that

echo the tribute that the hon member pay to baroness winterton who be in the chair when give my maiden speech over the summer recess spend lot of time in the small community in my constituency include knotty green winchmore hill chenies coleshill seer green and jordans there be some common theme that would like to raise before the house adjourn as member might imagine some of the issue be particularly local to the area in coleshill there be real frustration at the continue lack of broadband in the village in coleshill and winchmore hill be tell about the lack of reliable bus service recent bus timetable change have make it hard for pupil to get back to school this term solution be find for the boy at local boy school but the same can not be say for the girl who no long have viable way to get to one of the local girl school on public transport from the village affect by the timetable change be mystify as to why boy and girl have be treat differently by the council it will not surprise the house that in all the village that go to resident share their horror at the state of our river many of they volunteer on the river chess and the river misbourne which be rare chalk stream and they can see the devastating impact of pollution and sewage number of young constituent come to share their concern for the environment and for make sure we all do our bit to save the planet pay tribute to one young constituent stella jackson for present her petition to she deserve particular praise for her effort in gather signature for the petition that she run in her village to encourage we all to reduce refuse recycle and reuse while be talk about our young people have to say that be encourage to see that last week westminster hall debate on service for special educational need and disability be so well attend indeed be unable to voice the experience of my constituent because westminster hall be so full there be crisis in send provision in our local area buckinghamshire council state that demand for send service have increase by in the past three year alone and that this be unsustainable the heartbreaking conversation that have with family over the summer support that assessment it be also hard to hear the story of people of all age who have be wait for healthcare appointment and treatment we know the nhs be under great pressure we know too that healthcare worker be work tirelessly in difficult circumstance hope that we can look back on today darzi report as the point at which the nhs start to turn corner wish to finish by mention the pensioner from my constituency who come to see this summer worried about the cut to the winter fuel allowance the matter come up in every village that visit since the summer recess almost other constituent have write to with similar concern this government can not be hold accountable for the mess they inherit but strip support from the poor pensioner just when energy bill be set to rise again can not be the answer one constituent with parkinson tell that cut back on their heating will almost certainly exacerbate their symptom take away this vital support be quite simply the wrong thing to do call dave robertson to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker may thank hon member who have make their first speech today for set the bar so high hope can live up to the standard that they have set be send to this place by the constituent of lichfield constituency that include not only the city itself but the town of burntwood and around village and hamlet in the great county of staffordshire be proud to serve the area that have be my home since before know to call anywhere home and where hope it will be for many many more year to come my predecessor in this house be sir michael fabricant he be knight in for political and public service after more than year represent first the constituency of mid staffordshire and then lichfield in this house thirty two year in total sir michael serve and think that would be number to which we would all aspire should be fortunate enough to still be in this place in year time madam deputy speaker can only hope to have such head of hair it be however to longevity that wish to turn now although have receive advice from some colleague not to mention the domesday book can neatly sidestep that as the record history of my constituency date back some year before william the conqueror to the roman invasion and the establishment of letocetum roman fort and later settlement near the crossroad of watling street and rykneld street in my constituency the crossing of those two road remain an important place throughout the roman and saxon period and in the century chad of mercia establish cathedral and diocese in lichfield which still exist today in just over week time will be proud to be in attendance at the installation of think the dean of lichfield cathedral the right reverend jan macfarlane will be the first woman to hold that post and will not only smash glass ceiling but be an excellent advocate for the cathedral and the church in the local community and beyond the century be also noteworthy for the burying of the staffordshire hoard which be uncover in hammerwich in my constituency in near that same crossroad of watling street and rykneld street the large collection of anglo saxon gold ever find the hoard be already have and will continue to have significant impact on our understanding of the people of these isle before there be an england scotland wales or northern ireland let move on from the century over the come year the city would continue to flourish and establish itself as religious and ecumenical centre although much of the surround area maintain its rural and agrarian aspect for many century to come in this time the area do produce innumerable great life and while they be far too numerous to mention all of they here should note gregory king the world first economic statistician elias ashmole whose collection found the ashmolean museum the first of its type in the uk david garrick the noted theatre innovator and manager the physician erasmus darwin found member of the lunar society who have rather famous grandson the poet anna seward thomas gisborne of yoxall lodge an abolitionist and close associate of william wilberforce the painter john louis petit who be have wonderful renaissance in the understanding of his work frederick oakeley who translate the word to come all ye faithful in lichfield cathedral and of course samuel johnson man of letter and the author of the first dictionary of the english language johnson heir samuel barber be freed slave who would go on to run school in burntwood decade before tom jenkins would begin teach in teviothead in scotland and who would also serve as dozener in local government in lichfield and almost certainly become the first black man to serve in local government in the uk before move on from some famous people from around the area should mention local success story in sophie capewell lichfield golden girl bring home not just gold medal from paris this year but world record as part of team gbs fantastic effort in do so she end my reign as the most successful former pupil of my old school nether stowe in lichfield and although have hop to hold that title little long than day be happy to be disappoint on that point return to my historical tour of lichfield and its surround area we reach the early and century and the town of burntwood conurbation of mining village which grow up some four mile from lichfield and have similarly proud history its most notable resident be the fundraiser and campaigner stephen sutton who raise million for the teenage cancer trust despite his diagnosis we lose he far too soon at the age of just he be make an mbe for his fundraising so it be more than fitting that burntwood town council remember he through student award name in his honour not to be outshone by the cathedral down the road burntwood also take its place in ecclesiastical history when in st anne church in chasetown become the first in the country to have electric lighting today the people of burntwood still maintain close knit community typical of former mining area that be show by the great example of the spark café and burntwood be friend which have do so much to step in to replace service cut during long year of conservative government if we be discuss burntwood we can not forget the giant kill exploit of chasetown fc in the fa cup of at some point will forgive the members for cardiff burntwood be not the only part of my constituency that have mining history the village of handsacre also more than play its part in power the industry of the and century it be also the village where my old man teach his first lesson as probationary teacher in the as for the suggestion that his geordie accent be in part responsible for his hiring in school build to teach the child of new arrival from the north east that remain suspect if unconfirmed mining be not the only industry that find its way to my part of staffordshire many of we will recognise the name armitage shanks but few will know its link to the village of armitage just short trip up rugeley road from handsacre as the new government focus their legislative agenda on growth remind colleague that while many of we may have already spend penny with armitage shanks they be all welcome to visit and spend many more in the come year all this industry mean that the canal come to my constituency the coventry canal and the trent and mersey canal be still navigable today and the work of the lichfield and hatherton canal restoration trust should be commend as it aim to restore that link as green and blue way over the come year have touch again on transport will complete the circle and return to the crossroad that make letocetum watle street or the as it be now know and rykneld street the be major transport artery that link my constituency together and link it easily to the rest of the country the in particular have help to establish logistic centre in the village of fradley on the site of the former raf lichfield fan of the bbc bargain hunt will know fradley well give the regular appearance of richard winterton and his auctioneer on that show hope that can get as much airtime as they do slightly far up the be the national memorial arboretum near alrewas wonderful venue as the site of national remembrance advise every single person to make visit there to remember not just in november but on any day be sure that in the come month the secretary of state for transport will grow tired of my lobbying about the need for railway station to serve that amazing location on dissimilar note the first travelodge in the uk be open slightly up the road some year ago near the village of barton under needwood although that village should be much well remember as the home of the holland tug of war team found in the team have represent england at numerous international tournament and even bring home silver medal from the world open championship it be to this constituency that will return during the recess look forward to speak to my constituent about transport access to healthcare education health and care plan and many other issue that be on their lip look forward to bring those story back to this place so that can continue to advocate on my constituent behalf call edward morello to make his maiden speech be extremely honoured to be give my maiden speech in debate name after the late great sir david amess be grateful for this opportunity thank all member who have give their maiden speech today enjoy the lot of they it have be wonderful to learn about the many famous former resident of lichfield and wish the hon member

what link craig david and fishfinger sandwich we all know well now be the first non conservative mp for west dorset in its year history something be extremely proud of that notwithstanding will start by pay tribute to my conservative predecessor chris loder family have farm west dorset for over year and he should be deservedly proud to have serve as its mp we be both successor to sir oliver letwin an mp who be so well respect by the resident of west dorset that they would stop at every opportunity to tell what fantastic constituency mp he be can only hope to leave this house as fondly remember in the area as he be although each of we have be proud to be the member for west dorset we be not west dorset proud member that honour go to the cerne abbas giant metre high chalk fertility symbol whose presence stand proud over the cerne valley for all to see west dorset be the good constituency in the country know that for fact because the town of bridport dorchester lyme regis and sherborne have at various time over the past few year be describe as the good town in britain by no less an authority than the dorset echo newspaper that share my unrivalled objectivity when it come to the virtue of west dorset west dorset be home to the world famous jurassic coast unesco world heritage site where mary anning help to revolutionise our understanding of prehistoric life she be long overlook by historian but her contribution be now recognise with beautiful statue in her home town of lyme regis at the other end of chesil beach be the fleet lagoon the uk large saltwater lagoon on which sit the abbotsbury swannery which be home to over swan and be fantastic day out especially if you love swan as well as the swan one can also see rather incongruously prototype of barnes wallis bounce bomb quite what the swan of abbotsbury think about their home be use as replica for the ruhr dam be still unknown sadly our beach and river see over hour of sewage release into they last year the river lim which exit at lyme regis be declare ecologically dead due to the level of pollution in it it be shameful that and my family before we go swim at the nearby beach of west bay must log on to the surfers against sewage app to check whether it be safe to swim commit during the campaign to use my seat in this house to pressure the government to take serious action on the issue of sewage and promise to do so west dorset be hardy country thomas hardy be renowne the world over for his poetry and novel such as far from the madding crowd and tess of the his work famously deal with theme of melancholy sadness and moral conflict emotion that be sure be familiar to member vote in the tory leadership contest in his lifetime he be also highly critical of the decline status afford to rural britain for even more than its beautiful town and coastline west dorset be constituency define by its countryside landscape manage and maintain by our farmer and food producer who be the beat heart of our rural economy we desperately need national food and farming strategy that will deliver sustainable living for our farmer far from be cut the farming budget must be significantly increase if conversation about food security be ever to be anything other than fine word as an environmentalist be delighted that we now have government who seem to understand the importance of tackle the climate crisis and who recognise the vital part that renewable energy will play in achieve net zero have spend large part of my career in renewable energy will be urge the government to go far and fast if we be to avoid the bad ravage of the climate emergency which be already unfold the liberal democrats will continue to champion the need for action in this house on the subject of my party pay tribute to our party leader my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey and many of my colleague owe our seat in no small part to his fantastic if unorthodox campaign must also pay tribute to another leader of the liberal democrats my political journey begin in with nick clegg resignation speech he say summarise here that in the face of the politic of identity nationalism and we versus they it have never be more important to keep the flame of liberalism alive it be true then and it be true now know then that it be not enough to stand on the sideline and watch the country that love so much be eat by the self interest of those who seek power only for power sake or for self enrichment sadly over the summer we see that there be those who would seek to use the misery of people who have come here seek refuge to further their own aim mention that because it will come as no surprise that the morellos be not originally from this island the morellos of italy become the morellos of spain with apology to both country for my pronunciation before come to britain at the beginning of the century one of my forebear die fighting in world war one for the country that adopt he and be bury in commonwealth war grave cemetery in northern france my own father serve in the royal navy even more than morellos my family be mazierskis my maternal grandfather come here from poland at the end of the second world war flee another type of political tyranny he arrive as child speak no english he become an engineer and set up build company his child become nurse teacher artist and architect his grandchild be doctor civil servant lecturer and environmentalist and one of they stand here today as member of parliament in my experience immigrant do not forget the debt they owe the country that offer they future we must not let hate win we must champion hope that be why it be more important than ever to fly the flag for liberalism liberal value and rule base international order would also like to mention my amazing wife she be far far cleverer than and would make far well politician without she certainly would not be here today not just because of the love and support she have show but because it be her suggestion that run in the first place something find myself remind she of with increase frequency finally thank the voter of west dorset for put their faith in it be huge honour to represent they and look forward to do everything can to deliver well deal for west dorset rise order think it would be huge shame in the sir david amess adjournment debate to put time limit on speech member can see how many be still stand and know that many would like to make their maiden speech before we disappear on recess perhaps member could think about restrict themselves to seven or eight minute so that can get everybody in this afternoon call connor rand to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to make my maiden contribution in this debate pay tribute to the member on both side of the house who have make their maiden contribution include the hon member for west dorset edward morello who give we an illuminate insight into what we could hope to see in his constituency also pay tribute to those who know sir david amess for their moving contribution be extremely proud to be the first labour member of parliament for altrincham and sale west

sum it up well while be knock on door in hale during the election campaign woman and the whole house will be relieve to know that will not attempt to impersonate she say of lord brady the thing about graham be that whether you agree or disagree with he and frankly usually disagree with he he be always unfailingly affable hope to one day be describe by my constituent in similar fashion of course as the result of rather interesting few year for the conservative party he might well come to be remember as one as the more consequential chair of the committee be sure the new chair the hon member for harrow east bob blackman be hop for slightly quieter few year judge by the friendly and collegial way in which that party leadership contest be shape up have every confidence that that will be the case when meet new member from all side of this house and tell they be fortunate enough to represent constituency as beautiful as altrincham and sale west in many case get nagging sense from they that my mere presence in this house represent where do be symptomatic not just of the level of change at the last general election but of labour party that be able to appeal to every part of our country and every section of society however the reality be that my constituency be extraordinarily diverse in almost every regard within easy reach of the city of manchester it be place of business thrive small and medium sized enterprise and entrepreneurship include the spectacular market in altrincham but wythenshawe and trafford general hospital be also major employer it be an area with ten of church four synagogue and the altrincham and hale muslim association and it be where many from hong kong have choose to start new life away from tyranny and repression yes it be part of the world where many people be do well for themselves and for their family but it also have an estimate child grow up in poverty what unite the constituency and make it such an extraordinary place be that it have such strong sense of community participation and everyone pitch in to play their part have see that at altrincham football club brilliant community club with amazing grassroots initiative and which in become the first team in england to wear shirt inspire by the rainbow flag to show their support in the fight against homophobia have see it from staff and volunteer at the garrick playhouse who work tirelessly to put on comprehensive series of play and production and have see it at trafford south food bank which work across the constituency to provide for people in need it be able to do what it do thank to the remarkably generous donation of local people however all too often organisation such as that food bank be have to go above and beyond in the most challenging of circumstance to stop people fall through the crack because as country we have fail to provide people with the security in work that they need we have fail to provide the economic stability and certainty that business need in order to invest and we have fail to address the long term challenge our country face that be why labour be elect to fix what have become break and to offer hope and renewal that be why the people of altrincham and sale west send here to cut waiting time across our national health service include at wythenshawe and trafford general to clean up our badly polluted river and stream and to make sure people can feel safe on our street by tackle crime and antisocial behaviour have work on national campaign against the violence and abuse that shopworker receive know how important it be

this debate and to follow the hon member for altrincham and sale west mr rand who give fantastic maiden speech join he in his kind word about his predecessor who be indeed an incredibly affable man who serve my party this house and this country with diligence while he be member of parliament know he will continue to do so now that he be in the other place it be also pleasure to speak in the debate name after sir david amess my only sadness be that the many new member will not have the benefit of his wit and wisdom unlike those of we who first come to this place early in my case in particularly welcome the new hon member for southampton test satvir kaur get to know her predecessor alan whitehead incredibly well when he be my shadow in the last parliament and we spend hour and hour take the energy bill through committee completely agree that there be nothing he do not know about the energy brief he be giant in that field and she do indeed have big shoe to fill can not quite agree with she when she make comparison with taylor swift so while she have hard act to follow be sure she will shake it off in time as my new hon friend the member for exmouth and exeter east david reed say there be indeed week in which decade happen can almost prove that point the last time address this house from the back benches be on july when speak against my government introduction of the energy profit levy by the time return to address this house be on the front bench as minister we have have two change of prime minister and one new monarch and have gain daughter that be by way of say to new member that thing happen fast here so be prepare for that yes speak about the introduction of the energy profit levy back in and although my front bench position preclude from speak about that measure from the back benches take this opportunity to beg ministers in charge of the new taxation and licensing policy in the north sea to remember that people in my community be very worried about their future in the oil and gas industry as these change be make ministers should remember that local people because of their livelihood and indeed those in community in many part of this country be watch and wait and they be worried madam deputy speaker know you agree that west aberdeenshire and kincardine be the most beautiful constituency in the united kingdom despite have hear so many member say the same about their part of the world people across the world see it in its full glory two year ago this week when after the death of her late majesty the queen at balmoral in the constituency my constituent and people across our region turn out in their thousand to line the road along royal deeside do not think anybody will forget the scene of the horse and tractor line up by the side of the road and of local people pay tribute to one of their own as she leave for the very last time on that day people around the world see what her late majesty see and what her son his majesty the king continue to see the majesty magnificence and unspoilt beauty of north east scotland that be one of the reason why there be such concern and worry about the plan for new energy infrastructure across the countryside in the constituency that be proud to represent tourism be so important to my constituent and indeed wide north east scotland but the hospitality and hotel sector have struggle visitor number be good but the cost of do business have increase markedly over the last few year energy price high staff cost and the lack of workforce have all contribute to the difficult and challenging environment in which some of scotland good hotel and restaurant continue to operate when we be in government we take action to protect hospitality business in last year autumn statement we extend the business rate relief for firm in the retail hospitality and leisure sector that mean that million extra would be send to scotland due to this policy area be devolve but the scottish government do not pass that on to the hospitality industry in scotland hospitality venue in west aberdeenshire and kincardine and indeed in the rest of scotland suffer because of the mismanagement of the scottish public finance and sadly because of the ignorance in the scottish government of how good to support that vital sector very much hope that the situation change and that any support for hospitality in the come budget will be pass on in full to the scottish business affect hospitality bring on to another sector of vital importance not just to west aberdeenshire and kincardine but to the united kingdom whisky on my regular visit to local distillery such as fettercairn and royal lochnagar have experience at first hand the real quality produce by these world recognise brand with world class

david be one that we aspire to thank all hon member for their wonderful maiden speech especially my hon friend the member for doncaster central sally jameson look forward to speak to she about her career in the prison officers association and the be too late campaign it be an honour to speak in the sir david amess adjournment debate the warmth and respect with which he be speak about be measure of the gentleman my contribution be neither light hearted nor happy the news that grangemouth will stop refine oil in quarter of be devastating it be accurate to say that the mood music from the refinery owner have be pessimistic for some time but even with the threat of closure that have be hang over the refinery today news be shocking what be happen will be feel far beyond grangemouth it will reverberate around scotland northern ireland and the north of england the area of the uk that grangemouth primarily service its closure will have an impact on all the constituency there will give brief history some year ago grangemouth be the perfect location for refinery there be an abundance of flat land bustling harbour and crucially an already skilled workforce that be experience in shale refining it be one of the first crude oil refinery in the uk it be currently the primary supplier of aviation fuel for scotland main airport and major supplier of petrol and diesel ground fuel across the central belt of scotland it also provide power to the forties oil pipeline bring oil and gas ashore from the north sea although operation and procedure have change over the century highly skilled local workforce remain constant could detail the statistic about how the grangemouth site contribute of scotland gdp and be key piece of scottish infrastructure but while that be accurate and pertinent when talk about the refinery want to talk about the human side of the issue when the refinery be know locally as the bp there be social club and gala event for family grangemouth be know as scotland boom town the refinery and specifically the worker create community that be industrious and working class where the job be dangerous skilled and highly value the grangemouth refinery provide apprenticeship to local people and the possibility to gain the experience and world class qualification that provide the opportunity of forge career platform for self improvement and social mobility for those of we who represent constituency with social issue which be often bear out of industry leave those community social mobility have become negative journey not positive one the comparison with the miner of four decade ago be clear and like the miner of the who keep britain warm the refinery worker of grangemouth keep britain move what happen to the miner can not be the fate of grangemouth refinery worker over the past few month the campaign to keep grangemouth work have spread the message of extend the life of the refinery invest in the workforce and make sure there be no gap that would see worker lose their job have stand in solidarity with the refinery worker and will continue to do so unite the union have say that it do not accept that the future of the refinery should have be leave to the whim and avarice of shareholder completely agree energy security be intrinsically link to national security and for both to be in the hand of foreign government and private capital be inherently wrong not to mention utterly reckless the primary ideal of the keep grangemouth working campaign be to extend the life of the refinery so that truly just transition can be achieve that be what should happen and nothing will convince otherwise oil will still be part of the energy mix for while yet and the refinery worker know that they also know that oil will not last forever they know that clean industry must come and they tell that they want to be part of new green industrial revolution they have so many of the skill that will be require for we to achieve net zero and make britain clean energy superpower but if there be gap between refining stop next year and these new industry be ready the truth be that the workforce will be go worker can not hang around and wait because mortgage need to be pay and family need to be feed job must be find or talent will leave the impact on the local community and the local economy would be enormous the shop the pub the restaurant the hotel the cafés the bed and breakfast and the snack van would all suffer if the refinery be to close as government we must do everything we can welcome the step that the secretary of state and his team have take with the announcement of million of funding to support the community and its worker by invest in local energy project to create new growth for grangemouth have previously speak positively about project willow and the importance of it be joint commitment between both government to determine what the industrial future of grangemouth will be because both the uk government and

time in london they might want to pop down for hot yoga weekend it whole thing however so many member have say something similar when describe their seat that be only half the story the other half be the still proudly industrial town of sittingbourne its character and location challenge many people preconception of kent sittingbourne twin on the isle of sheppey sheerness on sea have busy dock dock that hopefully will become only busy as the opportunity for growth construction and new green industry be realise by this government sittingbourne and sheppey be perfectly locate to take advantage of all that development my job be not only to argue for our place in the rebuilding of britain but to ensure that my constituent see real social economic health and wellbeing benefit from the opportunity the factor that lead to the foundation of our town be lay century ago fit the way that technological industrial and transport strategy be all point now sittingbourne straddle the main road from dover to london and be connect directly by water road and rail to sheerness dock on sheppey this be what make the saxon king of kent grab the land and claim it as their terra regis this be something that the resident of milton regis be very proud to remind of that it be royal town in the middle of sittingbourne it be those same route that allow the town of queenborough to develop as major port tuck behind sheppey be the safe waterway and major trading route from london through to the continent and the rest of the world those route be also what enable sittingbourne to develop major brick building industry in the century it produce more brick and have more people work in it than the pottery in staffordshire those brick be largely use to build london many town house in the century buckingham

to restore our rail freight link and an ambition to once again use our water route we can be at the heart of green revolution but there be more to place than land and water place be make by people what will ensure that the people of my constituency get the benefit that they be cry out for as result of growth and rebuilding be the strength of our local community and the collective action that come from grassroots organisation as we move more service out of hospital to the community and try to mend the broken sense of cohesion in our society these community actor will be key there be great organisation include seashell nursery in sheerness which hold true to the course take by sure start centre with their now prove benefit although they be sadly under threat of closure and wiggles child

organisation in my constituency be swale community and voluntary services which foster lot of organisation help they to get start get organise and help their community part of the reason for that depth of community co operation be that my constituency face the challenge of have some of the most deprived part of kent and the south east unfortunately big driver for that be the very geography that otherwise bring in so many benefit and opportunity as sheppey be an island with only one point in the west that connect to the rest of england there be pocket of isolation and when the two bridge

madam deputy speaker will not be fiddle with the ss richard montgomery wrecked world war two cargo ship sink just off sheerness which be pack with something like tonne of high explosive most expert feel that as long as the ship be not disturb the seawater will gradually inactivate those explosive so if they be ever disturb enough to trigger any firework would be minor however there be minority view that if something trigger all the explosive to go off at once the result explosion would not just inundate the whole of sittingbourne and sheppey but send metre tsunami back up the thames all the

authority with some devolve funding to support local priority with particular emphasis on regeneration business support and skill the ukspf begin in december and be due to end in march although it be by no mean perfect believe it have have broadly positive impact and would like to draw on my own experience as former medway council cabinet member responsible for distribute the ukspf feedback from whitehall to official at the council have be that medway council approach be consider good practice and hence be keen that the minister hear about our experience know he be big supporter of local government and evidence base policy making and no doubt he will wish to hear from other member of this house who also have direct experience of the ukspf in medway we use our ukspf allocation to support local community group business and charity which we consider well place to recognise what their area need in order to thrive rather than top down approach we ask community what they need and function as the facilitator to make thing happen use the ukspf the feedback we receive be that this approach be empower for local community and bring people together an spf network be establish that create mutually supportive community that lead in later year to joint bid for community project the ukspf potential to support broad regeneration effort to revitalise our town centre be significant in medway small pot of money deliver significant economic and social benefit one of the way be particularly keen to use the ukspf be to help our town centre forum host high street event on the basis that this would bring in thousand of extra visitor and benefit local business notable example of this be the chatham chinese new year festival hold early this year in what be now my constituency be the big such celebration in the uk outside london and lead to an approximate increase in footfall on chatham high street the festival be free to attend and see parade street food market traditional dancer and martial art masterclasse the chatham town centre forum partner with the local chinese association the shopping centre medway youth council and local school and charity to deliver the event feedback from resident and vendor be unanimously supportive material purchase use the ukspf will enable the event to run for future year without further financial support from the council so the ukspf will leave lasting impact this be important because we want scheme like the ukspf where possible to deliver long term benefit will briefly turn to few other way that we use the ukspf to support long term improvement in medway we offer small feasibility fund pot of as little as to help group demonstrate that an idea would work they could then use that proof of concept to go on to attract funding from other source to make it happen we help community group such as the chatham intra cultural consortium to transition into charitable incorporate organisation or cio achieve that new structure mean that it can bid for other source of funding and be less reliant on financial support from the council that mean it can continue its incredibly important heritage work help group to get on more financially sustainable footing be particularly important in the context of year of constrained local government finance we also use the ukspf to provide grant to help business to grow by purchase modern technology and equipment for instance gift business specialise in handmade travel keepsake be able to use the grant to invest in new fibre laser machine which significantly enhance the business productivity and efficiency allow it to handle large order we also fund net zero audits and green grant for local business that want to reduce their operating cost by make their premise more energy efficient and we help they get those green certificate that be now need to bid for many contract do my hon friend agree how important the spf be to area include truro and falmouth in cornwall that lose their funding under the european regional development fund and the european structural fund when we come out of the eu under brexit do she agree how fundamental it be that there be some sort of replacement fund for that absolutely agree and will be make the case for that replacement fund later thank my hon friend for her contribution in my constituency more than local business have so far be support under these ukspf fund programme to reduce their cost to grow their business and to contribute to help we reach net zero we would not be able to do that without this replacement funding for the eu structural fund be conscious that in this final funding year the focus of ukspf spending be on people and skill it will be important for ministers and other to assess the impact that these project have on help economically inactive people into good quality training and work the example have give be just snapshot of how local council across the uk have use the ukspf overall consider that the ukspf have work well in my constituency and understand that it have work well in other too which be great to hear it have deliver the economic growth and regeneration aim that this new government be commit to boost far despite those success there have be challenge with the ukspf and it be appropriate that we consider they now as the exist funding cycle come to close broad feedback from local authority to the local government association have highlight number of issue the first be short timescale from whitehall local authority be give just three month to develop ukspf investment plan in collaboration with local stakeholder we need to give people more time to get the right approach and to put more emphasis on long term strategic planning the lga have propose that any future version of the ukspf consider by the government should adopt six to eight year funding cycle and would certainly endorse that approach we also need to reflect on the impact of single year funding the annual funding allocation of the ukspf often lead to local authority commission service for just month in order to manage the financial risk for some project that be perfectly appropriate but for those local area use the ukspf for business or skill support for example it make it more difficult to address some of the long term issue and inequality in our community another issue be central government restriction the requirement that skill be address in year be an unnecessary restriction we should trust local authority to collaborate with their local partner in order to address community need without such restriction also consider that there be scope to improve and streamline the ukspf reporting process which some feedback have indicate be overly bureaucratic it be of course important that the government receive assurance that funding have be spend appropriately and use effectively fine balance will need to be strike in future finally be aware that there be some delay in get money out the door to local authority to fund agree project it be important that that too be consider by the new minister for any future approach to local growth funding will return to the immediate challenge that we face the expiration of funding to support the ukspf at the end of march without continued funding of some sort the type of initiative that have highlight will struggle to continue or be replicate be not aware of any exist funding that would help fill the gap for long term service such as business support and employability programme that rely on establish trust and employ staff the cliff edge be of particular concern provider be likely to see staff leave as contract get close to their end date put at risk effort to support business and help people get back into work and stay in good stable employment for those reason join with the lga to urge the minister to work with the chancellor to include an additional one year of flexible revenue funding for the ukspf in the forthcoming budget the lga have suggest that such funding should equate to the value of year of the ukspf programme ask the minister to consider that as part of his discussion with the chancellor do so would remove the immediate cliff edge and give ministers time to consider what the new government approach to local growth fund should be as have set out consider that long term allocation be need alongside more flexible and light touch national framework that support even great local decision making that would also give time to assess the full output of the ukspf and what improvement can be make for future replacement fund be pleased to say that the outcome achieve by medway council already exceed those set out in the original ukspf investment plan submit to whitehall some year ago that datum alongside datum from lot of other local authority should be available to ministers and could provide valuable steer on what approach prove successful and what do not work be really confident that by learn from the past and work in partnership with local government to deliver more flexible long term funding scheme the new government could provide real boost to local economy and community that go beyond far beyond anything that we have see in the current ukspf funding cycle it be pleasure to respond on behalf of the government to the excellent speech of my hon friend the member for rochester and strood lauren edwards be conscious that when speak in closing for the government yesterday my contribution last an unlikely minute be delighted not least because my voice be little on the cusp that the rule of the house will prevent such reoccurrence congratulate my hon friend on secure the debate and on the strength of the case she make it be clear from what she have say just now and previously be similarly grateful for the question she ask at oral question last week how strongly she feel about the uk share prosperity fund as well as the work she do in medway and the impact she make with the fund there be clearly an awful lot to learn from the medway example and look forward to do that when we meet again shortly after the conference recess be grateful to the minister for give way and to my hon friend the member for rochester and strood lauren edwards for secure this really important debate scotland have be beneficiary of the share prosperity fund to the tune of million since over million of which have come to my home city of glasgow do the minister agree that that be demonstration of the union dividend which scotland and the nation and region of the united kingdom enjoy by be part of this union do he far agree that the share prosperity fund be an important vehicle for bring equity to the region and nation of the united kingdom my hon friend make an important point the united kingdom government be ambitious for growth across all of the united kingdom ours be four nation commitment and we look forward to work closely with colleague in scotland in all strand of local growth funding to ensure that people across scotland and in wales and northern ireland get the benefit of growth and that dividend of which he speak on the particular point about the uk share prosperity fund agree on its effectiveness and will talk about its future as know colleague be keen for to do too thank my hon friend the member for rochester and strood lauren edwards for introduce this important debate council across the country include in derbyshire have face appalling cut over the last decade and the ukspf have be one of the few point of light in what have be very dark decade for local authority warmly welcome the new government commitment to offer council three year funding settlement but can encourage the minister to lobby the treasury to see what more it can do for local authority because the important service they provide be on the cusp of be inaccessible to people my hon friend make an important point about the health of local government like many colleague be veteran of local government and be very conscious of the pressure it be under as we design new model for local growth be also conscious that local authority will be at the heart of make it effective if they do not have the capacity because of those pressure that will be limit factor on our success and be very mindful of that have see at first hand the good work that the ukspf have do in my constituency and appreciate why there be such interest in its future it have help to support organisation that be address unemployment and provide training such as the bestwood partnership and evolve which have make huge difference to our community it have also back community project such as the kimberley community garden allow its member to redevelop their site and continue important community outreach work so understand very strongly why there be such interest in the fund as my hon friend the member for rochester and strood say future funding be matter for the chancellor and the budget of course we have the ongoing spending review and the budget on october appreciate the frustration that come with that answer but be afraid that that be where we be at the moment however that do not prevent from address number of the point that my hon friend make it be one of the beauty of the electoral cycle and of our democracy that change election bring in colleague with lot of different experience my hon friend talk about the impact that the million from the ukspf have have in medway and about what she do to design the work involve and be keen to learn from that it be good to hear how the funding have support growth in high street and town increase footfall support local business and regeneration in the town centre of chatham rainham and gillingham and address local challenge and crucially opportunity alongside community leader it have also support project such as emerge advocacy which support young people struggle with their mental health and mutual aid road reps which be form during the covid pandemic to combat loneliness and isolation those hugely significant project reach people who be often the hard to reach and the ukspf have back they similarly and very attractively as my hon friend say the fund have make sure that there have be great event in medway such as the chinese new year festival easter celebration heritage awareness event and the intra lateral art festival there be lot of great thing and the model in medway show that put local people in charge and let they set local priority yield great result include significant increase in town centre footfall and great sense of community when my hon friend say medway be model there be lot of evidence for that and look forward to hear about it my query be about the current version of the share prosperity fund some of the capital project go on at the moment be time limit to the end of march some will not be finish by then but local authority be rush to complete they and spend more money because they be worried that some of it the current money not the future money could be claw back will the minister confirm that that will not be an issue with those exist project and that that money will not be claw back so those project can be complete be grateful for that intervention as my hon friend know have inherit or strand of local growth funding all at different stage with the decision make in many case many year ago we be try to make the most sense of they and get the good value out of they with regard to the project she mention encourage my hon friend to help her local project to engage with my official so that they can give clarity on precisely what the timeline be in the context of what may well be discuss as part of the budget be very happy to work with she to make sure that that happen turn to some of the challenge to the ukspf mention by my hon friend the member for rochester and strood we have to start with the future of the programme local authority right hon and hon member and organisation across the country that deliver project have rightly be seek clarity on what come next my mailbag be very full and we be give the matter full consideration we recognise the hard work undertake it be important that that be state from the dispatch box and we recognise the challenge that time pose organisation traditionally fund in annual cycle constantly have to put hard work member of staff on day redundancy notice that put pressure on people who then perhaps seek other work because it do not suit they and their life and why would it we understand that those cliff edge be not good thing they be at the forefront of our mind as we think about the future too congratulate my hon friend the member for rochester and strood on secure this debate and thank she for do so this be such an important moment we hear from my hon friend the member for glasgow south west dr ahmed about the importance of the uk share prosperity fund for his area be really glad to welcome the deputy prime minister my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner to my constituency during the general election campaign where she see the need for that funding fife have benefit greatly from more than million from the fund in recent year in my constituency that include project such as step on which be run by linkliving with raith rovers community foundation it provide target help for young people to improve their mental health order remind member that intervention must be short it also help employability and crucially access to work do the minister agree that such cross uk funding be hugely important for area like mine where inequality be an issue be very grateful for that intervention think can probably speak for most colleague when say that the general election be in many regard quite tricky one this time but one of the few source of joy be my right hon friend the deputy prime minister battle bus which seem to reach admirable distance up and down the country include to fife know from have speak to she how much she enjoy that visit the model my hon friend the member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward mention be great example of the impact be make on people life across fife and in many different part of the uk we be very mindful of that want to address the challenge mention by my hon friend the member for rochester and strood she start with timescale certainly the tiny run in in year one be not an example of good practice and be something we would always seek to avoid do not think that the government of the day think it be good idea but think they rather find themselves victim of circumstance we absolutely hear that point my hon friend mention the local government association desire for six to eight year funding window again understand that very well have to say that that be quite challenging government generally budget on three year cycle and often decision be make on one year cycle we have talk about want to give more certainty and long time period can not commit to six to eight year but can commit to that principle she mention the impact of single year funding and as say we very much understand that on my hon friend point about central restriction and monitoring that be one of the point on which the new government intend to diverge from the old one my view be that we need to give community up and down the uk the tool and resource to use their expertise to improve their community within the framework set by the prime minister and his mission for the country they be the expert in this case not ministers we want light touch on monitoring and we want to be less directive on what the funding be for ukspf be actually very good example of that relative to other local growth funding but hear some of the challenge on that they be important design challenge that think we can engineer out as part of any future local growth funding programming our model of local growth be reflect in the conversation we have have with local authority and community up and down the country we know there be desire to move to more allocative settlement with few beauty parade and strong focus on deprivation and need we know there be real desire for light touch on monitoring which can become cottage industry in itself and that be our view too growth be at the heart of the thing that will shape our future and growth with local growth funding the clue will be in the name we want to ensure that the project choose by local community drive growth of course we must see the fiscal picture in the context of the inheritance leave by the last government this morning my hon friend pen an article on well know labour lean blog and what take from that be the mutual desire of this government and local government to reset the relationship to make it well partnership and to drive well outcome that will think lead we to more positive place if local authority be in the room and fully engage they may be able to use their creativity to combine fund with other funding stream so that the money can go far the shared prosperity fund have be good model but we will make change particularly in relation to short term timescale and reduce some of the burden have mention the importance of reset the relationship with local government notwithstanding what we will be discuss on october those principle will guide everything we do to promote local growth we as government be commit to growth across the united kingdom we be elect on manifesto that stress the need to adopt partnership approach with local authority and an intention to stabilise the funding system and we be go to do that we be work closely with local authority stakeholder the scottish parliament the senedd and the northern ireland executive and will continue to do so to ensure that there be smooth transition to new funding regime look forward to visit northern ireland on monday to talk far to colleague who be interested in the ukspf my hon friend be rightly seek certainty know that they want that as soon as possible and we have at least bit of pathway towards it because as always important announcement will be make in the budget statement and the ongoing spending review will shape the future we hear the strong message that my hon friend have convey it have be brilliant to hear about the excellent work do in medway and in other part of the country and be keen to work with colleague as we go forward to shape local growth funding question put and agree to house adjourn
